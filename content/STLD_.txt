we refer to our founding principles as our six core strategic pillars they bring us together with a common focus and they provide the foundation upon which we operate and grow our unique entrepreneurial culture and business model benefit us operationally financially and through the responsible use of our resources in diverse economic environments innovation in all forms is essential to our success our teams focus on how to do things effectively and efficiently within our current operations and how we can continue to strategically grow this means creating solutions for our teammates customers suppliers and other stakeholders it also includes finding ways to operate more efficiently using minimal resources with minimal environmental impact our six pillars and the team’s execution of them each day has driven our success and sustainability 

​ 

 

differentiated model  uniquely steel dynamics 

competitively advantaged differentiation is core to our longterm value creation strategy we aim to set ourselves apart in every aspect of our business with a spirit of excellence with the following core values driving our differentiation strategy 

​ 

​ 

unique entrepreneurial culture 

our entrepreneurial culture is at the core of our success and is driven by our extensive performancebased incentive compensation philosophy for those on the plant floor to senior leadership over 60 of a plant floor colleague’s total potential compensation is “at risk” of being achieved due to both quality production and costeffectiveness metrics in place over 85 of our senior leadership team’s total potential compensation is “at risk” to companywide financial performance metrics that encourage longterm value creation including return on equity growth cash generation and return on invested capital metrics our common goal of consistently achieving excellence in all we do is reflected in the esprit de corps that permeates our team we believe diversity within our teams enhances broadbased thinking innovation and value creation 

​ 

diversified valueadded product offerings  supplychain solutions 

we have one of the most diversified highmargin product offerings of any domestic steel producer we have a track record of profitable growth driving diversification in both end markets and product offerings to sustain higher volume and profitability through all market environments this includes developing premium valueadded steel products with over 70 of our steel and fabrication sales being considered valueadded 

​ 

a key competitive advantage is our numerous supplychain solutions which provide significant advantages to our customers creating longlasting relationships and higher throughcycle sales the majority of our steelmaking operations are in locations near sustainable sources of scrap metals and near our customer base allowing us to realize freight savings for inbound scrap as well as for outbound steel products destined for our customers this also allows us to provide consistent ontime delivery to our customer base with relatively short lead times further solidifying our customer relationships 

​ 

this diversified portfolio of products enables us to access a broad range of markets serve a large customer base and helps mitigate our market exposure to any one product or sector resulting in increased throughcycle steel mill utilization in addition our valueadded steel product offerings help to balance our exposure to commodity grade products supplied by other steel manufacturers we will continue to seek additional opportunities and to collaborate with our customers to anticipate their future needs by further expanding our range of products and offerings 

our new southwestsinton flat roll division growth investment is a prime example of our internal growth and differentiated business model this electric arc furnace eaf flat roll steel mill will have approximately 30 million tons of annual steel production capacity including valueadded coating lines comprised of a galvanizing line with annual coating capacity of 550000 tons with galvalume capability and a paint line with annual coating capacity of 250000 tons as with all our growth initiatives we seek to competitively differentiate ourselves through service product capability and quality and supply chain solutions this investment encompasses each of these elements 

by leveraging our construction and operating expertise this nextgeneration” eaf flat roll steel mill will have product size and quality production capabilities beyond that of existing domestic eaf flat roll steel producers competing even more effectively with the integrated steel model and foreign competition our new steel mill will have the capability to provide higherstrength tougher grades of flat roll steel for the energy and automotive markets these ultrahighstrength steel products are not currently readily available from other domestic steel producers we are also building four additional valueadded flat roll steel coating lines comprised of a paint line and a galvanizing line located onsite at each of our southwestsinton and heartland flat roll divisions these lines will provide highmargin product and endmarket diversification 

the southwestsinton flat roll division construction team experienced several challenges during 2021 including weather related events supply chain disruptions and the ongoing covid19 impact on the construction industry which caused some delays the team navigated these challenges and the two coating lines were commissioned in the second half of 2021 with the remainder of the operations commencing in early 2022 

​ 

the southwestsinton flat roll division has significant competitive advantages—including geographic market positioning power accessibility competitive freight for the intended customers proximity to a deepwater port and site constructability by locating our new steel mill in sinton texas we strategically targeted underserved markets that are largely reliant on imports with long lead times and lower product quality capabilities providing customers throughout the southwest united states and mexico significant freight benefits and shorter lead times allowing them to realize working capital advantages additionally six steel customers have committed to locate onsite representing over 18 million tons of annual flat roll steel processing and consumption capacity all of these customers have broken ground on their respective operations

our new eaf steel mill is adhering to the same sustainability model as our other steelmaking facilities utilizing state of the art environmental controls and processes to produce high quality sustainable steel our existing eaf steel mills have a fraction of the greenhouse gas emissions ghg and energy intensity of average traditional integrated steelmaking technology resulting in a much more environmentally responsible steel production alternative 

vertically connected businesses and pullthrough volume advantage 

our vertically connected businesses contribute to our higher throughcycle steel production and overall profitability steel demand that is generated from our internal manufacturing businesses is a significant competitive advantage supporting higher and more stable throughcycle earnings and cash flow generation our steel fabrication operations and downstream processing locations use a significant amount of steel in their operations during weaker demand environments we can source more of their needs internally and during strong demand environments we can source more of their needs externally at a preferred cost ultimately we optimize our companywide profitability in all steel demand environments in 2021 our own steel consuming businesses purchased nearly 17 million tons of steel from our steel mills representing 15 of our total 2021 steel shipments

a strategic synergistic relationship also exists between our steel mills and metals recycling operations which is the largest supplier of recycled ferrous scrap to our steel operations this allows us to manage companywide working capital as we can retain less scrap inventory at the steel mills and we are able to source higherquality scrap for our steel mills optimizing cost and quality additionally as a consistent consumer of recycled ferrous scrap our steel operations help maintain steady sales for the metals recycling platform

technically advanced lowcost highlyefficient operations 

we operate some of the most technically advanced and environmentally responsible steel operations when compared to global steelmaking operations we are focused on maintaining one of the lowest operating cost structures in the north american steel industry our valueadded product diversification vertically connected businesses and performancebased incentive compensation programs drive our efficient environmentally responsible and competitively advantaged footprint

our low operating costs are primarily a result of our efficient plant designs and operations our high productivity rate our focus on ongoing maintenance requirements and strategic locations near sources of our primary raw material ferrous scrap and near our customers we will continue to develop innovative ways to use our equipment enhance our productivity and explore new technologies to further improve our unit costs of production at each of our facilities as one of the lowest cost producers in each of our three primary operating segments we are able to better manage through all market cycles and to consistently maximize our profitability additionally we continuously seek to maximize the variability of our cost structure and to reduce per unit and fixed costs 

sustainability 

sustainability is a part of our longterm value creation strategy we are dedicated to our people our communities and our environment we are committed to operating our business with the highest integrity and have been since our founding 

we only produce steel using eaf technology which uses recycled ferrous scrap as the primary raw material eaf steelmaking technology generates a mere fraction of the carbon emissions produced and energy intensity required by traditional blast furnace steelmaking technology we believe eaf production is currently the steelmaking technology that provides the least environmental impact is the most cost effective and provides the most flexibility and as such has been a focus of our growth strategy

our intentional growth strategy has focused on increasing throughcycle cash generation and providing growth opportunities for our people partners communities and shareholders all while keeping sustainability of resources and our impact to the environment at the fore we have intentionally developed a vertically connected operating model further strengthening our company by creating a circular manufacturing model 

our metals recycling platform collects and processes scrap from manufacturing and endoflife items such as automobiles appliances and machinery this processed scrap is then sold to endusers for reuse including our eaf steel mills which produce new steel from the scrapped material our steel is then sold to consumers that both further process and manufacture end products we sell a meaningful amount of steel to our own manufacturing businesses that in turn sell finished products to consumers ultimately when these products reach the end of their life cycle they can be collected as scrap and used again in our steelmaking operations creating our circular manufacturing model 

we recognize that minimizing the impact of ghg is important to our stakeholders including our customers shareholders local communities and team members we endeavor for continuous improvement in minimizing carbon dioxide emissions while maintaining compliance with regulation emission limits we monitor our ghg emissions by regularly reviewing furnace performance and efficiency we analyze the latest available technologies to also determine whether emissions can be minimized our carbon mitigation strategy and our related goals announced in july 2021 are integral to our overarching sustainability program to address climaterelated considerations our board of directors provides oversight concerning the company’s sustainability strategy disclosures and climaterelated impact our senior leadership including our chief executive officer chief financial officer and senior executives of our operating platforms establish our near and longterm strategies related to our climaterelated assessments goals and programs

experienced leadership team  fosters an entrepreneurial culture 

our senior leadership team is highly experienced and has a proven track record in the steel metals recycling and steel fabrication industries our leadership objectives are closely aligned with our stakeholders through meaningful stock ownership positions and performancebased incentive compensation programs that are correlated to the company’s profitability and operational performance in relationship to our steel manufacturing peers we emphasize decentralized operational decision making and responsibility while continuing to maintain appropriate corporate governance and risk oversight we reward teamwork innovation and operating efficiency and focus on maintaining the effectiveness of our performancedriven incentive bonus plans that are designed to maximize overall productivity and align the interests of our leadership and teams with our stakeholders

​ 

the metals recycling operations include both ferrous and nonferrous scrap metal processing transportation marketing brokerage and scrap management services strategically located primarily in close proximity to our steel mills and other enduser scrap consumers throughout the united states and central and northern mexico in august 2020 we completed the acquisition of zimmer sa de cv dba omnisource mexico a mexican metals recycling company which is an important part of our raw material procurement strategy for our new steel mill in sinton texas our metals recycling operations accounted for 12 during 2021 and 11 of our consolidated net sales during 2020 and 2019 export sales represented 11 10 and 9 of metals recycling segment net sales during 2021 2020 and 2019 respectively 

we shipped the following from our metals recycling operations

 ​ 

we sell various grades of processed ferrous scrap primarily to steel mills and foundries ferrous scrap metal is the primary raw material for eaf’s including our steel mills in addition we sell various grades of nonferrous metals including copper brass aluminum and stainless steel to smelters refineries alloy manufacturers specialty mills and other consumers

we purchase processed and unprocessed ferrous and nonferrous scrap metals in a variety of forms for our metals recycling facilities

ferrous scrap comes from two primary sources

 

nonferrous scrap comes from three primary sources 

 

we do not purchase a significant amount of scrap metal from a single source or from a limited number of major sources market demand and the composition quality size weight and location of the materials are the primary factors that determine prices

products our metals recycling operations primarily involve the purchase processing and resale of ferrous and nonferrous scrap metals into reusable forms and grades we process an array of ferrous products through a variety of methods including sorting shredding shearing cutting and breaking our major ferrous products include heavy melting steel busheling bundled scrap shredded scrap and other scrap metal products such as steel turnings and cast iron these products vary in properties or attributes related to cleanness size of individual pieces and residual alloys the necessary characteristics of the ferrous products are determined by the specific needs and requirements of the consumer and affect the individual product’s relative value we process numerous grades of nonferrous products including aluminum brass copper stainless steel and other nonferrous metals additionally we provide transportation logistics truck rail and river barge marketing brokerage and scrap management services providing competitive price and cost advantages to our suppliers and customers we design install and manage customized scrap management programs for industrial manufacturing companies

customers we sell various grades of processed ferrous scrap to endusers such as eaf steel mills integrated steelmakers foundries secondary smelters and metal brokers who aggregate materials for other large users ferrous scrap metal is the primary raw material for eafs such as our steel mills most of our ferrous scrap customers purchase processed scrap through negotiated spot sales contracts which establish a quantity purchase for the month the price we charge for ferrous scrap depends upon market demand composition quality size weight and transportation costs as well as the quality and grade of the scrap we sell various grades of processed nonferrous scrap to endusers such as aluminum sheet and ingot manufacturers brass and bronze ingot makers copper refineries mills smelters specialty steelmakers alloy manufacturers wire and cable producers utilities and telephone networks the price we charge for nonferrous scrap also depends upon market demand and pricing transportation costs as well as the quality and grade of the scrap

competition scrap is a global commodity influenced by conditions in a number of industrialized and emerging markets throughout asia europe and north america the markets for scrap metals are highly competitive both in the purchase of raw or unprocessed scrap and the sale of processed scrap with regard to the purchase of unprocessed scrap we compete with numerous independent recyclers as well as smaller scrap companies engaged only in collecting obsolete scrap in many cases we also purchase unprocessed scrap metal from smaller scrap dealers and other processors successful procurement of materials is determined primarily by the price offered by the purchaser for the raw scrap and the proximity of our processing facility to the source of the raw scrap both ferrous and nonferrous scrap sells as a commodity in both domestic and international markets which are affected sometimes significantly by relative economic conditions currency fluctuations and the availability and cost of transportation competition for sales of processed scrap is based primarily on the price quality and location of the scrap metals as well as the level of service provided in terms of reliability and timing of delivery

we also face potential competition for sales of processed scrap from other producers of steel products such as eaf’s and integrated steel mills some of which like us are also vertically connected in the scrap metals recycling business in addition other steel mills may compete with us in attempting to secure scrap supply through direct purchasing from our scrap suppliers scrap metal processors also face competition from substitutes for prepared ferrous scrap such as pig iron pelletized iron hot briquetted iron hbi direct reduced iron dri and other forms of processed iron

the industry is highly fragmented with many smaller regional national and global companies which have multiple locations in areas in which omnisource also operates no single scrap metals recycler has a significant market share in the domestic market

sources availability and cost of steel and other operations’ raw materials

scrap metals the principal raw material of our steel operations is scrap metal derived from among other sources home scrap” generated internally at steel mills themselves industrial scrap generated as a byproduct of manufacturing and obsolete scrap recycled from endoflife automobiles appliances and machinery and demolition scrap from obsolete structures containers and machines

ferrous scrap typically comprises more than 80 of the metallic melt mix in eaf steelmaking in contrast to integrated mill steelmaking where the proportion of scrap has traditionally been approximately 25 to 35 depending upon the scrap substitute material that may be available from time to time and the relative cost of such material the percentage of scrap used in our steelmaking operations could be increased or reduced in our metallic melt mix

many variables can impact ferrous scrap prices all of which reflect the pushes and pulls of the supply demand equation these factors include the level of domestic steel production high quality lowresidual scrap is a byproduct of steel manufacturing activity the level of exports of scrap from the united states and the amount of obsolete scrap production in addition historically domestic ferrous scrap prices generally have a strong correlation and spread to global pig iron pricing generally as domestic steel demand increases so does scrap demand and resulting scrap prices the reverse is also normally but not always true with scrap prices following steel prices downward when supply exceeds demand when scrap prices greatly accelerate this can challenge one of the principal elements of an eaf based steel mill’s traditional lower cost structure—the cost of its metallic raw material ​

iron units in addition to scrap pig iron dri hbi and internally sourced liquid pig iron are used in our eaf steel mill production during 2021 2020 and 2019 we consumed 110 million 104 million and 106 million tons respectively of metallic materials in our steelmaking furnaces of which iron units other than scrap represented approximately 13 of the tons in 2021 2020 and 2019 

energy resources 

electricity electricity is a significant input required in the eafs in our steelmaking operations representing approximately 4 of steel production costs of goods sold in 2021 2020 and 2019 we have entered into fixed price electricity contracts for the butler flat roll division columbus flat roll division roanoke bar division and steel of west virginia while our engineered bar products division has a combination of fixed pricing and market pricing for the various components of the electrical services demand charge energy charge riders etc our southwestsinton flat roll division purchases electricity at current market prices our structural and rail division purchases electricity at current market prices and through fixed price forward contracts

research and development 

our research and development activities have consisted of efforts to expand develop and improve our steel products and operating processes such as our southwestsinton flat roll division and our efforts to develop and improve alternative ironmaking technologies most of these research and development efforts have been conducted inhouse by our employees 

environmental matters 

our operations are subject to substantial and evolving local state and federal environmental health and safety laws and regulations concerning among other things emissions to the air discharges to surface and ground water and to sewer systems and the generation handling storage transportation treatment and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes and secondary materials our operations are dependent upon permits regulating discharges into the environment or the use and handling of byproducts in order to operate our facilities we dedicate considerable resources aimed at achieving compliance with federal state and local laws concerning the environment while we do not currently believe that our future compliance efforts with such provisions will have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

cash flows or financial condition this is subject to change in the everevolving regulatory environment in which we operate

since the interpretation and enforcement of environmental laws and regulations that may be enacted from time to time are subject to changing social or political pressures our environmental capital expenditures and costs for environmental compliance may increase in the future in addition due to the possibility of unanticipated regulatory or other developments the amount and timing of future environmental expenditures may vary substantially from those currently anticipated the cost of current and future environmental compliance may also place united states steel producers at a competitive disadvantage with respect to foreign steel producers which may not be required to undertake equivalent costs in their operations

pursuant to the resource conservation and recovery act rcra which governs the treatment handling and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes the united states environmental protection agency or united states epa and authorized state or local environmental agencies may conduct inspections to identify alleged violations or areas where there may have been releases of solid or hazardous constituents into the environment and require the facilities to take corrective action to address any such releases rcra also allows citizens to bring certain suits against regulated facilities for potential damages and cleanup our steelmaking and certain other facilities generate wastes subject to rcra our operations produce various byproducts some of which for example eaf dust are often categorized as hazardous waste requiring special handling for disposal or for the recovery of metallics we collect such byproducts in pollution control equipment such as baghouses and then recycle what’s possible and appropriately dispose of the remaining unusable byproducts while we cannot predict the future actions of the regulators or other interested parties the potential exists for required corrective action at these facilities the costs of which could be substantial

​ 

under the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act known as cercla or superfund the united states epa state agencies and in some instances private parties have the authority to impose joint and several liability for the remediation of contaminated properties upon generators of waste current and former site owners and operators transporters and other potentially responsible parties regardless of fault or the legality of the original disposal activity many states have statutes and regulatory authorities similar to cercla that can also apply we have a number of material handling agreements with various contractors to properly dispose of or recycle our eaf dust and certain other byproducts of our operations however we cannot assure that even if there has been no fault by us we may not still be cited as a waste generator by reason of an environmental cleanup at a site to which our byproducts were transported

the clean water act and similar state and local laws apply to aspects of our operations and impose regulatory restrictions related to the discharge of wastewater storm water and dredged or fill material the united states epa state agencies and in certain instances private parties have the ability to bring suit alleging violations and seeking penalties and damages the clean water act’s provisions can require new or expanded water treatment investments to be made and can limit or even prohibit certain current or planned activities at our operations

the clean air act and analogous state and local laws require many of our facilities to obtain and maintain air permits in order to operate air permits can impose new or expanded obligations to limit or prevent current or future emissions and to add costly pollution control equipment enforcement for alleged violations can be brought by the united states epa state agencies and in certain instances private parties and can result in substantial penalties and injunctive relief

in addition there are a number of other environmental health and safety laws and regulations that apply to our facilities and may affect our operations by way of example and not of limitation certain portions of the federal toxic substances control act oil pollution act safe drinking water act and emergency planning and community righttoknow act as well as state and local laws and regulations implemented by the regulatory agencies apply to aspects of our facilities’ operations in some instances we may also be subject to foreign governments’ regulations and international treaties and laws many of these laws allow both the governments and citizens to bring certain suits against regulated facilities for alleged environmental violations finally our operations could be subject to certain toxic tort suits brought by citizens or other third parties alleging causes of action such as nuisance negligence trespass infliction of emotional distress or other claims alleging personal injury or property damage

 item 1a risk factors 

many factors may have an effect on our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows we are subject to various risks resulting from changing economic environmental political industry business and financial conditions the factors as may be exacerbated by the impact of the covid19 pandemic described below represent our principal risks 

global and national risks related to our business 

our industry as well as the industries of many of our customers and suppliers upon whom we are dependent is affected by domestic and global economic factors including periods of slower than anticipated economic growth and the risk of a recession 

our financial results are substantially dependent not only upon overall economic conditions in the united states and globally including north america europe and in asia but also as they may affect one or more of the industries upon which we depend for the sale of our products global or domestic actions or conditions including political actions trade policies or restrictions such as the united statesmexicocanada agreement usmca proposed or actual changes in tax laws such as those recently introduced terrorism acts of war or hostility natural disasters or pandemics epidemics widespread illness or other health issues such as covid19 could result in changing economic conditions in the united states and globally disruptions to or slowdowns in our business our supply chain or our global or domestic industry or those of our customers or suppliers upon whom we are dependent additionally periods of slower than anticipated economic growth could reduce customer confidence and adversely affect demand for our products and further adversely affect our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows metals industries have historically been vulnerable to significant declines in consumption and product pricing during periods of economic downturn or continued uncertainty including the pace of domestic nonresidential construction activity

our business is also dependent upon certain industries such as construction automotive manufacturing transportation heavy and agriculture equipment and pipe and tube including octg markets and these industries are also cyclical in nature and have recently experienced supply chain disruptions such as the electronic chip shortage within the automotive industry therefore these industries may experience their own fluctuations in demand for our products based on such things as economic conditions supply chain disruptions raw material and energy costs consumer demand the rate of inflation and infrastructure funding decisions by governments many of these factors are beyond our control as a result of volatility in our industry or in the industries we serve we may have difficulty increasing or maintaining our level of sales or profitability a downturn in our industry or the industries we serve may adversely affect our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows

a prospective decline in consumer and business confidence and spending which is often coupled with reductions in the availability of credit or increased cost of credit as well as volatility in the capital and credit markets may adversely affect the business and economic environment in which we operate and the profitability of our business we are also exposed to risks associated with the creditworthiness of our customers and suppliers if the availability of credit to fund or support the continuation and expansion of our customers’ business operations is curtailed or if the cost of that credit is increased the resulting inability of our customers or of their customers to either access credit or absorb the increased cost of that credit may adversely affect our business by reducing our sales or by increasing our exposure to losses from uncollectible customer accounts a disruption of the credit markets could also result in financial instability of some of our customers and suppliers the consequences of such adverse effects could include the interruption of production at the facilities of our customers the reduction delay or cancellation of customer orders delays or interruptions of the supply of raw materials we purchase and bankruptcy of customers suppliers or other creditors any of these events may adversely affect our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows

​ 

​ 

global steelmaking overcapacity and imports of steel into the united states may adversely affect united states steel prices which together with increased scrap prices may adversely affect our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

global steelmaking capacity currently exceeds global consumption of steel products which adversely affects united states and global steel prices such excess capacity sometimes results in steel manufacturers in certain countries exporting steel and steel products including prefabricated long product steel at prices that are lower than prevailing domestic prices and sometimes at or below their cost of production excessive imports of steel and steel products including prefabricated steel into the united states may exert downward pressure on united states steel and steel products prices which adversely affects our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows fluctuations in the value of the dollar can also affect imports as a strong united states dollar makes imported products less expensive potentially resulting in more imports of steel products into the united states by our foreign competitors furthermore recent additions of domestic steel capacity as well as anticipated additional domestic steel capacity could increase this global overcapacity this in turn has led to and may further lead to increased domestic demand for ferrous scrap resulting in increased scrap prices our results of operations financial condition and cash flows are driven primarily from the metal spread achieved from the price we sell steel and steel products compared to the price of our metallic raw materials including scrap during prolonged periods of steel and steel products overcapacity leading to lower selling prices combined with high demand for scrap and raw materials leading to higher buying prices our metal spreads could be compressed which may adversely affect our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows

united states steel producers compete with many foreign producers including those in china vietnam and other asian and european countries competition from foreign producers is typically strong and is periodically exacerbated by weakening of the economies of certain foreign steelmaking countries at times due to imports of steel involving dumping and subsidy abuses by foreign steel producers some foreign steel producers are owned controlled or subsidized by foreign governments as a result decisions by these producers with respect to their production sales and pricing are sometimes influenced to a greater degree by political and economic policy considerations than by prevailing market conditions realities of the marketplace or consideration of profit or loss additionally low iron ore prices resulting in disruption of the scrap price correlation to iron ore leads to reduced global costs to produce steel further depressing steel import prices a higher volume of steel imports into the united states tends to occur at depressed prices when foreign steelmaking countries experience periods of economic difficulty decreased demand for steel products or excess capacity the global steelmaking overcapacity is exacerbated by chinese steel production capacity that far exceeds that country’s demand and has made china a major global exporter of steel resulting in weakened global steel pricing than otherwise would be expected while tariffs pursuant to section 232 of the trade expansion act of 1962 as amended section 232 other measures to curb unfair trade such as duties or quotas and the renegotiation of trade agreements with other countries including the usmca have decreased the volume of steel and steel products imports domestic steel and steel products prices remain negatively impacted by excessive imports of steel and steel products should the section 232 tariffs duties or quotas expire or be relaxed repealed or circumvented by importers of steel and steel products or should trade agreements be renegotiated downward pressure may be exerted on united states steel and steel products prices which may adversely affect our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows

pandemics epidemics widespread illness or other health issues such as the covid19 pandemic may adversely affect our business results of operations financial condition cash flows liquidity and stock price 

pandemics epidemics widespread illness or other health issues such as a resurgence of covid19 may adversely affect our business results of operations financial condition cash flows liquidity and stock price the covid19 pandemic has resulted in various government actions globally including united states federal and state governmental actions designed to slow the spread of the virus and its impacts these actions have included quarantines “shelter in place” “stay at home” and “social distancing” orders business shutdowns and restrictions travel restrictions and other mitigation efforts which among other things have impacted and may further impact demand for our products our supply chain and our employees these measures along with further mandatory requirements or voluntary measures by businesses and individuals have impacted and may further impact our working conditions productivity and operations as well as those of our customers and suppliers these mitigation measures have also adversely affected and may continue to adversely affect the united states and global economies 

additionally while our operations have not been curtailed virus variants that are more contagious or more severe could reduce demand for our products and thus reduce the productivity of our operations and adversely affect our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows we or certain of our customers and suppliers may also experience supply chain disruptions such as those in the automotive industry which may adversely affect our operations reduced demand for our products or raw material supply availability due to shutdowns or slowdowns in businesses may further adversely affect our volumes and margins results of operations financial condition and cash flows the covid19 pandemic has also caused volatility in the financial and capital markets and led to new and expanded governmental programs and initiatives which affected and may further affect our stock price 

there remains uncertainty regarding the economic and industry impacts including duration from the covid19 pandemic and the measures introduced to curtail its spread and its impacts in the event vaccinations for covid19 have unanticipated sideeffects are not widely administered have more limited than expected benefits or are not as effective against new variants the effects of covid19 on the economy and our business could worsen although these highly uncertain future impacts cannot be reasonably estimated at this time general economic conditions business closures slow payments from customers increased bankruptcies and labor restrictions may adversely affect our business results of operations financial condition cash flows liquidity and stock price 

industry risks related to our business 

our level of production and our sales and earnings are subject to significant fluctuations as a result of the cyclical nature of the steel industry and some of the industries we serve 

the steel manufacturing business is cyclical in nature and the selling price of the steel we make may fluctuate significantly due to many factors beyond our control furthermore a number of our products are commodities subject to their own cyclical fluctuations in supply and demand in both metal consuming and metal generating industries including the construction and manufacturing industries the timing magnitude and duration of these cycles and the resulting price fluctuations are difficult to predict the sale of our manufactured steel products is directly affected by demand for our products in other cyclical industries such as construction automotive manufacturing transportation heavy and agriculture equipment and pipe and tube including octg markets economic difficulties stagnant or slow global economies supplydemand imbalances supply chain disruptions periods of heightened inflation and currency fluctuations in the united states or globally may decrease the demand for our products or increase the amount of imports of steel into the united states which may decrease our sales margins and profitability

volatility and major fluctuations in prices and availability of scrap metal scrap substitutes supplies and our potential inability to pass higher costs on to our customers may constrain operating levels and reduce profit margins 

steel producers require large amounts of raw materials including scrap metal and scrap substitute products such as pig iron pelletized iron and other supplies such as zinc graphite electrodes and ferroalloys our principal raw material is scrap metal derived primarily from industrial scrap and endoflife automobiles appliances and machinery and demolition scrap from obsolete structures containers and machinery the prices for scrap are subject to market forces largely beyond our control including demand by united states and foreign steel producers of which there has been recent capacity additions and expected further additions freight costs and speculation the scrap metal recycling industry has historically been and is expected to remain highly cyclical and the prices for scrap have varied significantly in the past may vary significantly in the future and do not necessarily fluctuate in tandem with the price of steel moreover some of our integrated steel producer competitors are not as dependent as we are on scrap as a part of their raw material melt mix which during periods of high scrap costs relative to the cost of blast furnace iron used by the integrated producers give them a raw material cost advantage over eaf mills however given environmental considerations of investors customers and regulators additional eaf mills may be constructed leading to increased demand in scrap possibly resulting in higher scrap prices while our vertical integration into the metals recycling business and our liquid pigiron operations are expected to enable us to continue being a costeffective supplier to our own steelmaking operations for some of our metallics requirements we still rely on other metallics and raw material suppliers as well as upon general industry supply conditions for the balance of our needs

the availability and prices of raw materials and supplies particularly those with positive environmental attributes may also be negatively affected by new existing or changing laws regulations sanctions or embargoes including those that may impose output limitations or higher costs associated with climate change or ghg allocation by suppliers interruptions in production accidents or natural disasters changes in exchange rates global price fluctuations the availability and cost of transportation and competing uses all of which may be heighted during times of war or hostilities including those occurring in eastern europe as it relates to global pig iron supply as a major producer of galvanized steel products we purchase and consume a large amount of zinc which if purchased at high prices may adversely affect our profit margins any inability to secure a consistent costeffective and timely supply of our raw materials and supplies may adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows

additionally our inability to pass on all or any substantial part of any cost increases whether due to positive environmental attributes inflation supply and demand imbalances or otherwise or to provide for our customers’ needs because of the potential unavailability of raw materials or supplies may result in production slowdowns or curtailments or may otherwise adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows

the cost and availability of electricity natural gas oil and other energy resources are subject to volatile market conditions 

steel producers like us consume large amounts of energy to melt ferrous scrap in eafs and reheat steel for rolling into finished products we rely on third parties for the supply of energy resources we consume in our steelmaking activities the prices for and availability of electricity natural gas oil and other energy resources including renewable or other clean energy sources are subject to regulation and volatile market conditions often affected by weather conditions as well as political environmental and economic factors beyond our control as consumers of electricity and natural gas we must have dependable delivery in order to operate accordingly we are at risk in the event of an energy disruption including power outages or power unavailability prolonged blackouts or brownouts or disruptions caused by natural disasters or by political or environmental considerations would substantially disrupt our production since a significant portion of our finished steel products are delivered by truck unforeseen fluctuations in the price of fuel would also adversely affect our costs or the costs of many of our customers

increased environmental ghg emissions and sustainability considerations or regulations could affect demand for our products and add significant costs on both our steelmaking and metals recycling operations 

investors customers and regulators have increased their focus on the environment ghg emissions and sustainability we are committed to the environment and sustainability and recently announced goals in furtherance of that commitment we believe that achievement of these goals will comport with expectations of our investors and customers but certain investors and customers may have differing requirements to achieve these goals our operational costs may increase and we may have additional capital expenditures some of which we may not be able to pass along to our customers any failure to timely meet these goals may have an adverse effect on our business results of operations and stock price

additionally the united states government various other governmental agencies regulators investors or other groups may introduce request or require environmental monitoring disclosures or regulations in response to the potential impacts of climate change international treaties or agreements may also result in increasing regulation of ghg emissions including the introduction of carbon emissions limitations or trading mechanisms any such regulation or disclosure requirement could impose significant costs on our operations and on the operations of our customers and suppliers including increased energy capital equipment emissions controls environmental monitoring and reporting and other costs in order to comply with current or future laws regulations or demands concerning the environment climate change ghg emissions and sustainability any adopted future regulations could negatively impact our ability and that of our customers and suppliers to compete with companies situated in areas not subject to or not complying with such limitations or could affect our environmental disclosures for any allowances offsets or credits we may see an increase in costs relating to our assets that emit ghgs as a result of these initiatives which may impact our operations directly or through our customers and suppliers until the timing scope and extent of any future regulation becomes known we cannot predict the effect on our financial condition operating performance and ability to compete

compliance with and changes in environmental and remediation requirements may result in substantially increased capital requirements and operating costs 

existing laws or regulations as currently interpreted or as may be interpreted in the future as well as future laws or regulations may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition

we are subject to numerous local state federal and international statutory and regulatory environmental requirements relating to among other things

● the generation storage treatment handling and disposal of solid and hazardous waste and secondary materials

 ● the management treatment and discharge of wastewater and storm water

● the use and treatment of groundwater

● the remediation of soil and groundwater contamination

● climate change legislation or regulation

● the need for and the ability to timely obtain air water or other environmental permits

● the timely reporting of certain chemical usage content storage and releases

● the remediation and reclamation of land used in our operations

● natural resource protections and

● the protection of our employees’ health and safety

compliance with environmental laws and regulations which affect our steelmaking metals recycling liquid pigiron and copper and aluminum production operations is a significant factor in our business we are required to obtain and comply with environmental permits and licenses and failure to obtain or renew or the violation of any permit or license may result in substantial fines and penalties capital expenditures operational changes suspension of operations andor the closure of a subject facility similarly delays increased costs andor the imposition of onerous conditions to the securing or renewal of permits may adversely affect these operations

uncertainty regarding adequate pollution control levels testing and sampling procedures and new pollution control technology are factors that may increase our future compliance expenditures we are unable to predict the ultimate cost of future compliance with environmental requirements or their effect on our operations although we strive to be in substantial compliance with all applicable laws and regulations legal requirements frequently change and are subject to interpretation such that regulatory agencies may bring enforcement actions for alleged noncompliance private parties might also bring claims against us under citizen suit provisions andor for property damage or personal injury allegedly resulting from our operations new laws regulations and changing interpretations by regulatory authorities together with uncertainty regarding the application of existing requirements are among the factors that may increase our future expenditures to comply with environmental requirements the cost of complying with existing laws or regulations as currently interpreted or reinterpreted in the future or with future laws or regulations may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition

our operations produce significant amounts of byproducts some of which are handled as solid or hazardous waste or as hazardous secondary materials for example our steel mills generate eaf dust which the united states environmental protection agency united states epa and other regulatory authorities classify as hazardous waste and regulate accordingly unless recycled in an exempt manner

​ 

in addition the feed materials for the shredders operated by our metals recycling operations include automobile bodies a portion of the feed materials consist of unrecyclable material known as shredder residue if laws or regulations or the interpretation of the laws or regulations change with regard to eaf dust or shredder residue or other byproducts created by our operations we may incur significant additional expenditures

federal and state environmental laws enable the united states epa state agencies and certain private parties to recover from owners operators generators and transporters the cost of investigation and cleanup of sites at which wastes or hazardous substances were disposed in connection with these laws we may be required to clean up contamination discovered at our sites including contamination that may have been caused by former owners or operators of the sites to conduct additional cleanup at sites that have already had some cleanup performed to address emerging and newlyregulated contaminants such as per and polyfluoroalkyl substances pfas and 14dioxane andor to perform cleanup with regard to sites formerly used in connection with our operations

in addition we may be required to pay for or to pay a portion of the costs of cleanup at sites to which we sent materials for disposal or recycling notwithstanding that the original disposal or recycling activity may have complied with all regulatory requirements then in effect under certain laws a party can be held jointly and severally liable for all of the cleanup costs associated with a disposal site in practice a liable party often splits the costs of cleanup with other potentially responsible parties we have received notices from the united states epa state agencies and third parties that we have been identified as potentially responsible for the costs of investigating and cleaning up a number of disposal sites in most cases many other parties are also named as potentially responsible parties and also contribute to payment of those costs

because cleanup liability can in some cases be imposed retroactively on activities that occurred many years ago and because the united states epa and state agencies are still discovering sites that pose a threat to public health or the environment we can provide no assurance that we will not become liable for significant costs associated with investigation and remediation of cleanup sites

operational and commercial risks related to our business 

we may face significant price and other forms of competition from other steel producers scrap processors and alternative materials which may adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

the global markets in which steel companies and scrap processors conduct business are highly competitive and became even more so due to consolidations in the steel and scrap industries additionally in many applications steel competes with other materials such as aluminum cement composites plastics carbon fiber glass and wood increased use of alternative materials for any reason including as a response to regulations or customer demands could decrease demand for steel or force other steel producers into new products or markets that compete more directly with us and combined with increased competition could cause us to lose market share increase expenditures or reduce pricing any one of which may adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

availability of an adequate source of supply of scrap is required for our metals recycling operations 

we procure our scrap inventory from numerous sources these suppliers generally are not bound by longterm contracts and generally have no obligation to sell recyclable metal to us in periods of low industry scrap prices scrap suppliers may elect to hold recyclable metal to wait for higher prices or intentionally slow their metal collection activities if a substantial number of scrap suppliers cease selling recyclable metal to us we may be unable to recycle metal at desired levels which may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition in addition a slowdown of industrial production in the united states reduces the supply of industrial grades of metal to the metals recycling industry resulting in our having less recyclable metal available to process and sell further additional eaf steel mill construction could increase the demand for scrap potentially resulting in higher scrap prices or periods of decreased scrap supply any inability to secure scrap for our eaf steel mills could adversely affect our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows

we are subject to cybersecurity threats and may face risks to the security of our sensitive data and information technology which may adversely affect our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

increased global cybersecurity and information technology security requirements vulnerabilities and threats and a rise in sophisticated and targeted cybercrime all of which may be heightened during times of war or hostilities pose a risk to the security and functionality of our systems and information networks and to the confidentiality availability and integrity of sensitive data including intellectual property proprietary information financial information customer and supplier information and personally identifiable information additionally such cybersecurity vulnerabilities or attacks could result in an interruption of the functionality of our automated and electronically controlled manufacturing operating systems which if compromised could cease threaten delay or slow down our ability to melt roll or otherwise process steel or any of our other products for the duration of such interruption our customers and suppliers may also store certain of our sensitive information on their information technology systems which if breached or attacked could likewise expose our sensitive information similarly information system vendors and software suppliers may experience a cybersecurity or information technology breach that exposes our systems or sensitive data any of these cybersecurity and information technology breaches or disruptions may result in reputational harm and may adversely affect our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows

although we believe we have adopted procedures and controls to adequately protect our sensitive data networks and information and operating technology and systems there can be no assurance that a system or network failure or cybersecurity breach or attack will be prevented whether due to attacks by cyber criminals or due to employee contractor or other error or malfeasance this could lead to system interruption production delays or downtimes and operational disruptions and the disclosure modification or destruction of sensitive data which may adversely affect our reputation customer and supplier relationships financial results and results of operations and could result in litigation or regulatory investigations actions fines or penalties as well as increased cybersecurity monitoring and protection costs including the cost of insurance additionally as cybersecurity threats continue to evolve and become more sophisticated we may need to invest additional time resources and finances to protect the security of our sensitive data systems and information networks we maintain an information security risk insurance policy to mitigate the impact of cybersecurity threats and we did not incur any net expenses from information security breach penalties and settlements during 2021 2020 or 2019 

we may face risks associated with the implementation of our growth strategy 

our growth strategy subjects us to various risks as part of our growth strategy we may expand existing facilities enter into new product or process initiatives acquire or build additional plants acquire other businesses and assets enter into joint ventures or form strategic alliances that we believe will complement our existing business these expansions and transactions may involve some or all of the following risks

 ● the inability to realize anticipated synergies or other expected benefits

● the difficulty of integrating new or acquired operations and personnel into our existing operations

● the potential disruption of ongoing operations

 ● the loss of key employees customers or suppliers of acquired businesses

● the potential exposure to unknown liabilities

● the inability of management to maintain uniform standards controls procedures and policies

● the difficulty of managing the growth of a larger company

 ● the risk of becoming more highly leveraged

 ● the inability to work efficiently with joint venture or strategic alliance partners and

● the difficulties of terminating joint ventures or strategic alliances

as operations commence at our new southwestsinton flat roll division in sinton texas we could face additional risks related to human capital attraction development and retention as well as startup inefficiencies additionally customer product or geographic markets we expect to serve may not be as profitable as currently expected which may adversely affect our prospects business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

these expansions or transactions might be required for us to remain competitive but we may not be able to complete any such expansions or transactions on favorable terms or obtain financing if necessary future expansions and transactions may not improve our competitive position and business prospects as anticipated and if they do not our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows may be adversely affected

we are subject to litigation and legal compliance risks which may adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and liquidity 

we are involved from time to time in various litigation matters including administrative proceedings regulatory proceedings governmental investigations environmental matters and commercial and construction contract disputes none of which at the present time are expected to have a material impact on our financial conditions results of operations or liquidity for additional information regarding legal proceedings please refer to item 3 legal proceedings 

in addition to risks associated with our environmental and other regulatory compliance our international operations are subject to complex foreign and united states laws and regulations including the foreign corrupt practices act and other antibribery laws regulations related to importexport controls the office of foreign assets control and other laws and regulations each of which may increase our cost of doing business and expose us to increased risk

unexpected equipment downtime or shutdowns may adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

interruptions in our production capabilities may adversely affect our production costs products available for sale and earnings during the affected period in addition to equipment failures our facilities are subject to the risk of catastrophic loss due to unanticipated events such as fires explosions or violent weather conditions our manufacturing processes are dependent upon critical pieces of steelmaking equipment such as our eafs continuous casters and rolling equipment some of which are controlled by our information technology systems as well as electrical equipment such as transformers this equipment may on occasion be out of service as a result of unanticipated failures or other events including cybersecurity breaches or attacks or system failures further we may experience startup or other operational interruptions at our new southwestsinton flat roll division we have experienced plant shutdowns or periods of reduced production as a result of such equipment failures and may in the future experience plant shutdowns or periods of reduced production as a result of such equipment failures or other events these disruptions may adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows

governmental agencies may refuse to grant or renew some of our licenses and permits required to operate our businesses 

we must receive licenses and air water and other permits and approvals from state and local governments to conduct certain of our operations or to build expand or acquire new facilities governmental agencies nongovernmental organizations and members of the public sometimes resist the establishment of certain types of facilities in their communities there can be no assurance that future approvals licenses and permits will be granted or that we will be able to maintain and renew the approvals licenses and permits we currently hold failure to do so may adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows

our senior unsecured credit facility contains and any future financing agreements may contain restrictive covenants that may limit our flexibility 

restrictions and covenants in our existing debt agreements including our senior unsecured credit facility and any future financing agreements may impair our ability to finance future operations or capital needs or to engage in other business activities a breach of any of the restrictions or covenants could cause a default under our senior unsecured credit facility our senior notes or our other debt a significant portion of our indebtedness may then become immediately due and payable

under our senior unsecured credit facility we are required to maintain certain financial covenants our ability to meet such covenants or other restrictions can be affected by events beyond our control if a default were to occur the lenders could elect to declare all amounts then outstanding to be immediately due and payable and terminate all commitments to extend further credit

impairment charges may adversely affect our results of operations 

occasionally assumptions that we have made regarding products or businesses we have acquired or sought to develop about the sustainability of markets we sought to exploit or about industry conditions that underlie our decision making when we elected to capitalize a venture turn out differently than anticipated in such instances the fair value of such assets may fall below their carrying value recorded on our balance sheet

accordingly we periodically test goodwill longlived tangible and intangible assets and right of use assets to determine whether their estimated fair value is in fact less than their value recorded on our balance sheet if we determine that the fair value of any of these assets from whatever cause is less than the value recorded on our balance sheet we are required to incur noncash asset impairment charges that adversely affect our results of operations there can be no assurances that market dynamics or other factors may not result in future impairment charges

2021 overview

during 2021 domestic steel demand was strong throughout the year supported most significantly by the construction automotive and industrial sectors customer steel inventories also remained historically low as steel supply was not sufficient to meet robust demand requirements during much of the year this strong market environment drove significantly higher steel selling prices resulting in meaningful steel segment metal spread expansion our metals recycling operations benefited from improved domestic steel mill utilization rates in 2021 driving increased shipments pricing and metal spread the nonresidential construction market remained strong driving increased shipments and order backlog pricing and metal spread in our steel fabrication operations the symbiotic relationship among our three operating segments resulted in record companywide financial and operational performance during 2021

we achieved record 2021 operational and financial results 

​ 

 

​ 

consolidated operating income for 2021 increased 35 billion more than four times to 43 billion compared to 8471 million in 2020 net income attributable to steel dynamics inc for 2021 increased 27 billion more than four and a half times to 32 billion compared to 2020 diluted earnings per share attributable to steel dynamics inc was 1556 for 2021 compared to 259 for 2020

​ 

segment results 2021 vs 2020

during 2021 domestic steel consumption was strong from the automotive construction and industrial sectors these market dynamics along with historically low customer inventories throughout the supply chain drove increased shipments and product pricing for our steel operations compared to 2020 which was negatively impacted by covid19 most notably during the second quarter of the year steel operations segment shipments increased 4 in 2021 as compared to 2020 with average selling prices increasing 81 or 621 per ton net sales for the steel operations were 88 higher in 2021 when compared to 2020 due to these increased average steel selling prices and volumes

​ 

metallic raw materials used in our electric arc furnaces represent our single most significant steel manufacturing cost generally comprising approximately 55 to 65 of our steel mill operations’ manufacturing costs our metallic raw material cost consumed in our steel mills increased 179 per net ton or 67 in 2021 compared to 2020

​ 

as a result of average selling prices increasing more than scrap costs metal spread which we define as the difference between average steel mill selling prices and the cost of ferrous scrap consumed in our steel mills increased 86 in 2021 compared to 2020 due to this metal spread expansion coupled with the 4 increase in steel segment shipments operating income for the steel operations increased nearly four times to 44 billion in 2021 compared to 2020

​ 

 ​ 

metals recycling operations includes both ferrous and nonferrous scrap metal processing transportation marketing brokerage and scrap management services our steel mills utilize a large portion approximately 66 in 2021 and 69 in 2020 of the ferrous scrap sold by our metals recycling operations as raw material in our steelmaking operations and the remainder is sold to other consumers such as other steel manufacturers and foundries metals recycling operations accounted for 12 and 11 of our consolidated net sales during 2021 and 2020 respectively

​ 

metals recycling operations shipments

 ​ 

segment results 2021 vs 2020

our metals recycling operations benefited from strong steel market demand during 2021 driving increased domestic steel mill utilization and strong ferrous scrap shipments throughout the year domestic steel mill utilization rates increased to approximately 81 in 2021 from 68 in the prior year which was depressed due to the impact of covid19 during most notably the second quarter of 2020 net sales for our metals recycling operations increased 91 in 2021 as compared to 2020 driven by increased shipments including a full year of activity related to our august 2020 acquired mexican scrap operations and pricing ferrous scrap average selling prices increased 73 during 2021 compared to 2020 while nonferrous average selling prices increased 53 ferrous metal spread which we define as the difference between average selling prices and the cost of purchased scrap increased 35 while nonferrous metal spread increased 61 in 2021 compared to 2020 metals recycling operations operating income in 2021 of 1820 million improved 1490 million or four and a half times from 2020 due to increased ferrous and nonferrous shipments and metal spread

​ 

 ​ 

steel fabrication operations include seven new millennium building systems joist and deck plants located throughout the united states and in northern mexico revenues from these plants are generated from the fabrication of steel joists trusses girders and steel deck used within the nonresidential construction industry steel fabrication operations accounted for 10 and 9 of our consolidated net sales during 2021 and 2020 respectively

​ 

​ 

​ 

segment results 2021 vs 2020

our steel fabrication operations benefited in 2021 from a robust nonresidential construction market as order activity was strong throughout the year resulting in record shipments as well as a record customer order backlog at the end of 2021 and higher selling prices due to the strength of warehouse construction related to distribution and data centers net sales for the segment increased 95 during 2021 compared to 2020 as shipments increased 19 and average selling prices increased 64 or 874 per ton

​ 

the purchase of various steel products is the largest single cost of production for our steel fabrication operations historically representing approximately twothirds of the total cost of manufacturing however closer to threefourths in 2021 with the increased steel costs the average cost of steel consumed increased 82 in 2021 as compared to 2020 consistent with increased steel selling prices in our steel operations as a result of selling prices per ton increasing more than steel input costs per ton metal spread which we define as the difference between average selling prices and the cost of purchased steel increased 45 in 2021 compared to 2020 this expanded metal spread coupled with record shipments resulted in record operating income of 3653 million in 2021 compared to 1206 million in 2020

​ 

 ​ 

consolidated results 2021 vs 2020

selling general and administrative expenses selling general and administrative expenses increased 35 or 1665 million to 6440 million during 2021 compared to 2020 representing 35 and 50 of net sales respectively this increase relates primarily to increased 2021 profitability and increased southwestsinton flat roll division startup expenses of 706 million 

profit sharing expense was 3881 million in 2021 including 196 million of additional companywide special compensation awarded to all nonexecutive team members in recognition of the company’s exceptional annual performance an increase of 3264 million from the 617 million earned during 2020 the companywide profit sharing plan represents 8 of pretax earnings

interest expense net of capitalized interest during 2021 interest expense of 572 million decreased 377 million from the 949 million incurred during 2020 due to decreased interest expense related to our june 2020 and october 2020 refinancing of 16 billion of high yield senior notes with lower interest rate senior notes and a 265 million increase in capitalized interest in 2021 related to the construction of our new southwestsinton flat roll division

income tax expense income tax expense of 9623 million in 2021 at an effective income tax rate of 229 increased 615 from the 1347 million at an effective income tax rate of 191 during 2020 consistent with increased income before income taxes the lower effective tax rate in 2020 related primarily to the release of a deferred tax asset valuation allowance and increased federal tax credits refer to note 4 income taxes to the consolidated financial statements elsewhere in this report for additional information

included in the balance of unrecognized tax benefits at december 31 2021 are potential benefits of 168 million that if recognized would affect the effective tax rate we recognize interest and penalties related to our tax contingencies on a netoftax basis in income tax expense during the year ended december 31 2021 we recognized benefits from the decrease of interest expense and penalties of 205000 net of tax in addition to the unrecognized tax benefits noted above we accrued 561000 for the payment of interest and penalties at december 31 2021

we file income tax returns in the united states federal jurisdiction as well as income tax returns in various state jurisdictions the tax years 2018 through 2020 remain open to examination by the internal revenue service and various state and local jurisdictions at this time we do not believe there will be any significant examination adjustments that would result in a material change to our financial position results of operations or cash flows it is reasonably possible that the amount of unrecognized tax benefits could change in the next twelve months in an amount ranging from zero to 33 million as a result of the expiration of the statute of limitations and other federal and state income tax audits

liquidity and capital resources

capital resources and longterm debt our business is capital intensive and requires substantial expenditures for among other things the purchase and maintenance of equipment used in our operations and to remain in compliance with environmental laws our shortterm and longterm liquidity needs arise primarily from working capital requirements capital expenditures including expansion projects principal and interest payments related to our outstanding indebtedness no significant principal payments until 2024 dividends to our shareholders and potential stock repurchases and acquisitions or investments we have met and intend to continue to meet these liquidity requirements primarily with available cash and cash provided by operations and longterm borrowings and we also have availability under our unsecured revolver our liquidity at december 31 2021 is as follows in thousands

 ​ 

our total outstanding debt remained consistent at 31 billion during 2021 our total longterm debt to capitalization ratio representing our longterm debt including current maturities divided by the sum of our longterm debt redeemable noncontrolling interests and our total stockholders’ equity decreased to 330 at december 31 2021 from 416 at december 31 2020 due to the growth in stockholders’ equity from undistributed 2021 earnings

our unsecured credit agreement has a senior unsecured revolving credit facility facility which provides a 12 billion unsecured revolver and matures in december 2024 subject to certain conditions we have the opportunity to increase the facility size by 5000 million the unsecured revolver is available to fund working capital capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes the facility contains financial covenants and other covenants pertaining to our ability to incur indebtedness and permit liens on certain assets our ability to borrow funds within the terms of the unsecured revolver is dependent upon our continued compliance with the financial and other covenants at december 31 2021 we had 12 billion of availability on the revolver 120 million of outstanding letters of credit and other obligations which reduce availability and there were no borrowings outstanding

the financial covenants under our facility state that we must maintain an interest coverage ratio of not less than 250100 our interest coverage ratio is calculated by dividing our lasttwelvemonths ltm consolidated adjusted ebitda earnings before interest taxes depreciation amortization and certain other noncash transactions as allowed in the facility by our ltm gross interest expense less amortization of financing fees in addition a debt to capitalization ratio of not more than 060100 must be maintained at december 31 2021 our interest coverage ratio and debt to capitalization ratio were 4504100 and 033100 respectively we were therefore in compliance with these covenants at december 31 2021 and we anticipate we will continue to be in compliance during the next twelve months

working capital we generated cash flow from operations of 22 billion in 2021 operational working capital representing amounts invested in trade receivables and inventories less current liabilities other than income taxes payable and debt increased 17 billion to 33 billion at december 31 2021 due primarily to increased accounts receivable and inventory consistent with increased net sales inventory volumes and associated costs

capital investments during 2021 we invested 10 billion in property plant and equipment primarily within our steel operations segment compared with 12 billion invested during 2020 of these amounts 8310 million related to our southwestsinton flat roll steel division in 2021 and 9277 million in 2020 we enter 2022 with ample liquidity of 24 billion to provide for our currently planned 2022 capital requirements 

cash dividends as a reflection of continued confidence in our current and future cash flow generation ability and financial position we increased our quarterly cash dividend by 4 to 026 per share in the first quarter 2021 from 025 per share in 2020 resulting in declared cash dividends of 2109 million during 2021 compared to 2105 million during 2020 we paid cash dividends of 2130 million and 2092 million during 2021 and 2020 respectively our board of directors along with executive management approves the payment of dividends on a quarterly basis the determination to pay cash dividends in the future is at the discretion of our board of directors after taking into account various factors including our financial condition results of operations outstanding indebtedness current and anticipated cash needs and growth plans

other in february 2020 our board of directors authorized a share repurchase program of up to 5000 million of our common stock this program was exhausted in july 2021 in july 2021 our board of directors authorized an additional share repurchase program of up to 10 billion of our common stock under the share repurchase programs purchases take place as and when we determine in open market or private transactions made based upon the market price of our common stock the nature of other investment opportunities or growth projects our cash flows from operations and general economic conditions the share repurchase programs do not require us to acquire any specific number of shares and may be modified suspended extended or terminated by us at any time the share repurchase programs do not have an expiration date we repurchased 169 million shares of our common stock for 11 billion during 2021 as of december 31 2021 we had 3834 million remaining available to purchase under the 2021 share repurchase program see part ii item 5 market for registrant’s common equity related stockholder matters and issuer purchases of equity securities for additional information

our ability to meet our debt service obligations and reduce our total debt will depend upon our future performance which in turn will depend upon general economic financial and business conditions along with competition legislation and regulatory factors that are largely beyond our control in addition we cannot assure that our operating results cash flows access to credit markets and capital resources will be sufficient for repayment of our indebtedness in the future we believe that based upon current levels of operations and anticipated growth cash flows from operations together with other available sources of funds including borrowings under our revolver if necessary will be adequate for the next twelve months for making required payments of principal and interest on our indebtedness funding working capital requirements and anticipated capital expenditures noted above

​ 

contractual obligations and other longterm liabilities

we have the following minimum commitments under contractual obligations including purchase obligations as defined by the securities and exchange commission a “purchase obligation” is defined as an agreement to purchase goods or services that is enforceable and legally binding and that specifies all significant terms including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased fixed minimum or variable price provisions and the approximate timing of the transaction

longterm debt and estimated interest refer to note 3 longterm debt to the consolidated financial statements elsewhere in this report for our longterm debt maturities estimated interest payments on our senior unsecured notes were determined based on their outstanding balances through maturity at their contractual interest rates as detailed in note 3 estimated interest payments also include a 0175 commitment fee on our available revolver and an average interest rate of 19 on our other debt of 1054 million our estimated interest payments are 1008 million 991 million 984 million 803 million 750 million for the years 2022 through 2026 respectively and 4477 million thereafter

purchase obligations we have commitments for the purchase of commodities such as electricity water natural gas and its transportation services fuel air products zinc and electrodes refer to note 9 commitments and contingencies to the consolidated financial statements elsewhere in this report for this information

construction commitments we have firm contracts with various vendors for the completion of certain construction projects at our various divisions at december 31 2021 refer to note 9 commitments and contingencies to the consolidated financial statements elsewhere in this report for this information

lease commitments we have entered into operating leases relating principally to transportation and other equipment and some real estate refer to note 12 leases to the consolidated financial statements elsewhere in this report for this information

unrecognized tax benefits we expect to make cash outlays in the future related to our unrecognized tax benefits however due to the uncertainty of the timing we are unable to make reasonably reliable estimates regarding the period of cash settlement with the respective taxing authorities refer to note 4 income taxes to the consolidated financial statements elsewhere in this report for this information

​ 

other matters

environmental and other contingencies

we have incurred and in the future will continue to incur capital expenditures and operating expenses for matters relating to environmental control remediation monitoring and compliance during 2021 we incurred costs related to the monitoring and compliance of environmental matters in the amount of approximately 445 million and capital expenditures related to environmental compliance of approximately 370 million of which approximately 338 million is related to the construction of our new southwestsinton flat roll division of the costs incurred during 2021 for monitoring and compliance approximately 72 were related to the normal transportation of certain types of waste produced in our steelmaking processes and other facilities in accordance with legal requirements we incurred combined environmental remediation costs of approximately 86000 at all of our facilities during 2021 we have an accrual of 58 million recorded for environmental remediation related to our metals recycling operations and 26 million related to our idled minnesota ironmaking operations we believe apart from our dependence on environmental construction and operating permits for our existing and any future manufacturing facilities that compliance with current environmental laws and regulations is not likely to have a materially adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or liquidity however environmental laws and regulations evolve and change and we may become subject to more stringent environmental laws and regulations in the future such as the impact of united states government or various governmental agencies introducing regulatory changes in response to the potential of climate change

critical accounting policies and estimates

management’s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states we review the accounting policies we use in reporting our financial results on a regular basis the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent liabilities we evaluate the appropriateness of these estimations and judgments on an ongoing basis we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources results may differ from these estimates due to actual outcomes being different from those on which we based our assumptions we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements

revenue recognition and credit losses except for our steel fabrication operations we recognize revenues at the point in time the performance obligation is satisfied and control of the product is transferred to the customer upon shipment or delivery at the amount of consideration the company expects to receive including any variable consideration the variable consideration included in the company’s steel operations segment contracts which is not constrained include estimated product returns and customer claims based on historical experience and may include volume rebates which are recorded on an expected value basis our steel fabrication operations segment recognizes revenue over time at the amount of consideration the company expects to receive revenue is measured on an output method representing completed fabricated tons to date as a percentage of total tons required for each contract the company does not exercise significant judgments in determining the timing of satisfaction of performance obligations or the transaction price provision is made for estimated product returns and customer claims based on historical experience if the historical data used in our estimates does not reflect future returns and claims trends additional provision may be necessary the allowance for credit losses for accounts receivable is based on our reasonable estimate of known credit risks and historical experience adjusted for current and anticipated economic and other pertinent factors affecting our customers that may differ from historical experience

we are exposed to credit risk in the event of nonpayment by our customers which in steel operations are principally intermediate steel processors and service centers that sell our products to numerous industry sectors including the construction automotive manufacturing transportation heavy and agriculture equipment and pipe and tube including octg markets our metals recycling operations sell ferrous scrap to steel mills and foundries and nonferrous scrap such as copper brass aluminum and stainless steel to among others ingot manufacturers copper refineries and mills smelters and specialty mills our steel fabrication operations sell fabricated steel joists and deck primarily to the nonresidential construction market we mitigate our exposure to credit risk which we generally extend initially on an unsecured basis by performing ongoing credit evaluations and taking further action when necessary such as requiring letters of credit or other security interests to support the customer receivable if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate for any reason resulting in the impairment of their ability to make payments additional allowance may be required

inventories we record inventories at lower of cost or net realizable value cost is determined using a weighted average cost method for raw materials and supplies and on a firstin firstout basis for other inventory we record amounts required if any to reduce the carrying value of inventory to its net realizable value as a charge to cost of goods sold if product selling prices were to decline in future periods further writedown of inventory could result specifically raw material inventory such as scrap or steel substrate purchased during periods of peak market pricing

impairments of longlived tangible and definitelived intangible assets we review longlived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of such assets may not be fully recoverable impairment losses are recorded on longlived assets used in operations when indicators of impairment are present and the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than the assets’ carrying amounts the impairment loss is measured by comparing the fair value of the asset to its carrying amount we consider various factors and determine whether an impairment test is necessary including by way of examples a significant and prolonged deterioration in operating results andor projected cash flows significant changes in the extent or manner in 

which an asset is used technological advances with respect to assets which would potentially render them obsolete our strategy and capital planning and the economic environment in markets to be served when determining future cash flows and if necessary fair value we must make judgments as to the expected utilization of assets and estimated future cash flows related to those assets we consider historical and anticipated future results general economic and market conditions the impact of planned business and operational strategies and all other available information at the time the estimates are made those estimates and judgments may or may not ultimately prove accurate

a longlived asset is classified as held for sale upon meeting specified criteria related to ability and intent to sell an asset classified as held for sale is measured at the lower of its carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell as of december 31 2021 and 2020 the company reported 71 million and 72 million respectively of assets held for sale within other current assets in our consolidated balance sheet an impairment loss is recognized for any initial or subsequent writedown of the asset held for sale to its fair value less cost to sell for assets determined to be classified as held for sale in the year ended december 31 2021 and 2020 the asset carrying amounts approximated their fair value less cost to sell the company determined fair value using level 3 fair value inputs as provided for under asc 820 consisting of information provided by brokers and other external sources along with management’s own assumptions

events occurred during the fourth quarter of 2020 that represented impairment indicators related to the company’s noncore oil and gas joint ventures therefore the company undertook a fourth quarter 2020 assessment of the recoverability of the carrying amounts of these joint ventures’ property plant and equipment based on the joint ventures’ outlook at the time of this 2020 assessment the company concluded that the carrying amounts of its property plant and equipment were fully impaired this assessment resulted in a total noncash asset impairment charge of 194 million which include amounts attributable to noncontrolling interests of 24 million that in total served to reduce net income attributable to steel dynamics inc by 120 million for the year ended december 31 2020 

goodwill

our goodwill relating to various business combinations consisted of the following at december 31 in thousands

​ 

 ​ 

at least once annually as of october 1 or when indicators of impairment exist the company performs an impairment test for goodwill goodwill is allocated to various reporting units which are generally one level below the company’s operating segments the fair value of the reporting unit is determined by using an estimate of future cash flows utilizing a riskadjusted discount rate to calculate the net present value of future cash flows income approach and for some years by using a market approach based upon an analysis of valuation metrics of comparable peer companies using level 3 fair value inputs as provided for under asc 820 if the fair value exceeds the carrying value of the reporting unit there is no impairment if the carrying amount exceeds the fair value we recognize an impairment loss in the amount by which the carrying value of the net assets assigned to the reporting unit exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit with the impairment loss not to exceed the amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit

key assumptions used to determine the estimated fair value of each reporting unit under the discounted cash flows method income approach include a expected cash flows for the fiveyear period following the testing date including market share sales volumes and prices costs to produce and estimated capital needs b an estimated terminal value using a terminal year growth rate determined based on the growth prospects of the reporting unit and c a riskadjusted discount rate based on management’s best estimate of market participants’ aftertax weighted average cost of capital and market risk premiums key assumptions used to determine the estimated fair value of each reporting unit under the market approach include the expected revenues and cash flows in the next year we consider historical and anticipated future results general economic and market conditions the impact of planned business and operational strategies and all 

available information at the time the fair values of its reporting units are estimated those estimates and judgments may or may not ultimately prove accurate

goodwill acquired in past transactions are naturally more susceptible to impairment primarily due to the fact that they are recorded at fair value based on operating plans and economic conditions at the time of acquisition consequently if operating results andor economic conditions deteriorate after an acquisition it could result in the impairment of the acquired assets a deterioration of economic conditions may not only negatively impact the estimated operating cash flows used in our cash flow models but may also negatively impact other assumptions used in our analyses including but not limited to the estimated cost of capital andor discount rates additionally we are required to ensure that assumptions used to determine fair value in our analyses are consistent with the assumptions a hypothetical marketplace participant would use as a result the cost of capital andor discount rates used in our analyses may increase or decrease based on market conditions and trends regardless of whether our actual cost of capital has changed therefore we may recognize an impairment in spite of realizing actual cash flows that are approximately equal to or greater than our previously forecasted amounts

our fourth quarter 2021 2020 and 2019 annual goodwill impairment analyses did not result in any impairment charges management does not believe that it is reasonably likely that our reporting units will fail the goodwill impairment test in the near term as the determined fair value of the reporting units with goodwill exceeded their carrying value by more than an insignificant amount changes in judgments and estimates underlying our analysis of goodwill for possible impairment including expected future operating cash flows and discount rate could decrease the estimated fair value of our reporting units in the future and could result in an impairment of goodwill

income taxes we are required to estimate our income taxes as a part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements this requires us to estimate our actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatments of items for tax and accounting purposes these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities which are included within our consolidated balance sheet we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely we must establish a valuation allowance we also establish reserves to reduce some or all of the tax benefit of any of our tax positions at the time we determine that the positions become uncertain we adjust these reserves including any impact on the related interest and penalties in light of changing facts and circumstances such as the progress of a tax audit a number of years may elapse before a particular matter for which we have established a reserve is audited by a taxing authority and finally resolved the number of years with open tax audits varies depending on the tax jurisdiction a tax benefit that has been previously reserved because of a failure to meet the more likely than not recognition threshold would be recognized in our income tax expense in the first interim period when the uncertainty disappears settlement of any particular issue would usually require the use of cash

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk

market risk

in the normal course of business we are exposed to interest rate changes our objectives in managing fluctuations in interest rates are to limit the impact of these rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower overall borrowing costs to achieve these objectives we may use interest rate swaps to manage net exposure to interest rate changes related to our portfolio of borrowings however we have not done so during 2021 2020 or 2019

 item 1 business

steel dynamics inc is one of the largest domestic steel producers and metal recyclers in the united states based on estimated steelmaking and coating capacity of approximately 13 million tons and actual metals recycling volumes as of december 31 2020 with one of the most diversified product and endmarket portfolios in the domestic steel industry the company’s primary sources of revenue are from the manufacture and sale of steel products the processing and sale of recycled ferrous and nonferrous metals and the fabrication and sale of steel joists and deck products

we refer to our founding principles as our six core strategic pillars they bring us together with a common focus and they provide the foundation upon which we operate and grow our unique entrepreneurial culture and business model benefit us operationally financially and through the responsible use of our resources in diverse economic environments innovation in all forms is essential to our success and our teams focus on how to do things “smarter” within our current operations as well as how we continue to grow this means creating solutions for our teammates customers suppliers and other stakeholders it also includes finding ways to “do business” with fewer resources and less environmental impact our six pillars and the team’s execution of them each day has driven our success and sustainability 

 

differentiated model  uniquely steel dynamics 

competitively advantaged differentiation is core to our longterm value creation strategy we aim to set ourselves apart in every aspect of our business with a spirit of excellence with the following core values driving our differentiation strategy 

unique entrepreneurial culture 

our entrepreneurial culture is at the core of our success and is driven by our extensive performancebased incentive compensation philosophy for those on the plant floor to senior leadership over 60 of a plant floor colleague’s total potential compensation is “at risk” to both quality production and costeffectiveness over 85 of our senior leadership team’s total potential compensation is “at risk” to companywide financial performance metrics that encourage longterm value creation including return on equity growth cash generation and return on invested capital metrics our common goal of consistently achieving excellence in all we do is reflected in the esprit de corps that permeates our team we believe diversity within our teams enhances broadbased thinking innovation and value creation 

​ 

diversified valueadded product offerings  supplychain solutions 

we have one of the most diversified highmargin product offerings of any domestic steel producer we have a track record of profitable growth driving diversification in both end markets and product offerings to sustain higher volume and profitability through all market environments this includes developing premium valueadded steel products with over 70 of our steel and fabrication sales being considered valueadded 

​ 

a key competitive advantage is our numerous supplychain solutions which provide significant advantages to our customers creating longlasting relationships and higher throughcycle sales the majority of our steelmaking operations are in locations near sustainable sources of scrap metals and near our customer base allowing us to realize freight savings for inbound scrap as well as for outbound steel products destined for our customers this also allows us to provide consistent ontime delivery to our customer base with relatively short lead times further solidifying our customer relationships 

​ 

this diversified portfolio of products enables us to access a broad range of markets serve a large customer base and helps mitigate our market exposure to any one product or sector resulting in increased throughcycle steel mill utilization in addition our valueadded steel product offerings help to balance our exposure to commodity grade products supplied by other steel manufacturers we will continue to seek additional opportunities and to collaborate with our customers to anticipate their future needs by further expanding our range of products and offerings 

our new southwestsinton flat roll division growth investment is a prime example of our internal growth and differentiated business model this 19 billion electric arc furnace eaf flat roll steel mill will have an estimated 30 million tons of annual steel production capacity including valueadded coating lines comprised of a galvanizing line with planned annual coating capacity of 550000 tons with galvalume capability and a paint line with annual coating capacity of 250000 tons as with all our growth initiatives we seek to competitively differentiate ourselves through service product capability and quality and supply chain solutions this investment encompasses each of these elements

by leveraging our construction and operating expertise we are building a nextgeneration” eaf flat roll steel mill with production capabilities designed to have product size and quality capabilities beyond that of existing domestic eaf flat roll steel producers competing even more effectively with the integrated steel model and foreign competition our new steel mill will have the capability to provide higherstrength tougher grades of flat roll steel for the energy and automotive markets these ultrahighstrength steel products are not currently readily available from other domestic steel producers we will also be producing valueadded steel products at the commencement of operations providing highmargin product and endmarket diversification

out new steel mill is being strategically located in sinton texas which has significant competitive advantages—including geographic market positioning power accessibility competitive freight for the intended customers proximity to a deepwater port and site constructability by locating our new steel mill in sinton texas we are strategically targeting underserved markets that are largely reliant on imports with long lead times and lower product quality capabilities providing customers throughout the southwest united states and mexico significant freight benefits and shorter lead times allowing them to realize working capital advantages additionally our new steel mill site has sufficient acreage to allow for some customers to locate onsite providing them with logistics savings and our steel mill with volume baseloading opportunities three customers have committed to locate onsite representing over 10 million tons of annual processing and consumption capacity and we expect to secure similar commitments from additional customers 

our new eaf steel mill is adhering to the same sustainability model as our other steelmaking facilities utilizing stateoftheart environmental controls and processes to produce high quality sustainable steel our existing eaf steel mills have a fraction of the greenhouse gas emissions ghg and energy intensity of average traditional integrated steelmaking technology resulting in a much more environmentally friendly steel production alternative operations are planned to begin midyear 2021

vertically connected businesses and pullthrough volume advantage 

our vertically connected businesses contribute to our higher throughcycle steel production and overall profitability steel demand that is generated from our internal manufacturing businesses is a significant competitive advantage supporting higher and more stable throughcycle earnings and cash flow generation our steel fabrication operations and downstream processing locations use a significant amount of steel in their operations during weaker demand environments we source more of their needs internally and during strong demand environments we source more of their needs externally at a preferred cost ultimately we optimize our companywide profitability in all steel demand environments in 2020 our own steel consuming businesses purchased 15 million tons of steel from our steel mills representing 14 of our total 2020 steel shipments

a strategic synergistic relationship also exists between our steel mills and metals recycling operations which is the largest supplier of recycled ferrous scrap to our steel operations this allows us to reduce companywide working capital as we retain less scrap inventory at the steel mills and we are able to source higherquality scrap for our steel mills optimizing cost and quality additionally as a consistent consumer of recycled ferrous scrap our steel operations help maintain steady sales for the metals recycling platform

​ 

​ 

technically advanced lowcost highlyefficient operations 

we operate some of the most technically advanced and environmentally friendly steel operations when compared to global steelmaking operations we are focused on maintaining one of the lowest operating cost structures in the north american steel industry our valueadded product diversification vertically connected businesses and performancebased incentive compensation programs drive our efficient environmentally friendly and competitively advantaged footprint

our low operating costs are primarily a result of our efficient plant designs and operations our high productivity rate low ongoing maintenance cost requirements and strategic locations near sources of our primary raw material ferrous scrap and near our customers we will continue to develop innovative ways to use our equipment enhance our productivity and explore new technologies to further improve our unit costs of production at each of our facilities as one of the lowest cost producers in each of our three primary operating segments we are able to better manage through all market cycles and to consistently maximize our profitability additionally we continuously seek to maximize the variability of our cost structure and to reduce per unit and fixed costs 

sustainability 

sustainability is a part of our longterm value creation we are dedicated to our people our communities and our environment we are committed to operating our business with the highest integrity and have been since our founding 

we only produce steel using eaf technology which uses recycled ferrous scrap as the primary raw material eaf steelmaking technology generates a mere fraction of the carbon emissions produced and energy intensity required by traditional blast furnace steelmaking technology we believe eaf production is currently the steelmaking technology that provides the least environmental impact is the most cost effective and provides the most flexibility and as such has been a focus of our growth strategy

our intentional growth strategy has focused on increasing throughcycle cash generation and providing growth opportunities for our people partners communities and shareholders all while keeping sustainability of resources and climateimpact at the fore we intentionally developed a vertically connected operating model further strengthening our company by creating a “closed loop” manufacturing life cycle 

our metals recycling platform collects and processes scrap from manufacturing and from endoflife items such as automobiles appliances and machinery this processed scrap is then sold to endusers for reuse including our eaf steel mills which produce new steel from the scrapped material our steel is then sold to consumers that both further process and manufacture end products we sell a meaningful amount of steel to our own manufacturing businesses that in turn sell finished products to consumers ultimately when these products reach the end of their life cycle they can be collected as scrap and used again in our steelmaking operations creating our “vertically connected sustainable product life cycle” 

we recognize that minimizing the impact of ghg is important to our stakeholders including local communities and team members we endeavor for continuous improvement in minimizing carbon dioxide emissions while maintaining compliance with regulation emission limits we evaluate our ghg emissions by regularly reviewing furnace performance and efficiency we analyze the latest available technologies to also determine whether emissions can be minimized our carbon mitigation strategy is integral to our overarching sustainability program to address climaterelated considerations our board of directors provides oversight concerning the company’s sustainability strategy disclosures and climaterelated impact our senior leadership including our president and chief executive officer executive vice president chief financial officer and corporate secretary and other operating platform senior executives establish our near and longterm strategies related to our climaterelated assessments goals and programs

experienced leadership team  fosters an entrepreneurial culture 

our senior leadership team is highly experienced and has a proven track record in the steel metals recycling and steel fabrication industries our leadership objectives are closely aligned with our stakeholders through meaningful stock ownership positions and performancebased incentive compensation programs that are correlated to the company’s profitability and operational performance in relationship to our steel manufacturing peers we emphasize decentralized operational decision making and responsibility while continuing to maintain appropriate corporate governance and risk oversight we reward teamwork innovation and operating efficiency and focus on maintaining the effectiveness of our performancedriven incentive bonus plans that are designed to maximize overall productivity and align the interests of our leadership and teams with our stakeholders

ferrous scrap comes from two primary sources

 

nonferrous scrap comes from three primary sources 

 

we do not purchase a significant amount of scrap metal from a single source or from a limited number of major sources market demand and the composition quality size weight and location of the materials are the primary factors that determine prices

products our metals recycling operations primarily involve the purchase processing and resale of ferrous and nonferrous scrap metals into reusable forms and grades we process an array of ferrous products through a variety of methods including sorting shredding shearing cutting and breaking our major ferrous products include heavy melting steel busheling bundled scrap shredded scrap and other scrap metal products such as steel turnings and cast iron these products vary in properties or attributes related to cleanness size of individual pieces and residual alloys the necessary characteristics of the ferrous products are determined by the specific needs and requirements of the consumer and affect the individual product’s relative value we process numerous grades of nonferrous products including aluminum brass copper stainless steel and other nonferrous metals additionally we provide transportation logistics truck rail and river barge marketing brokerage and scrap management services providing competitive price and cost advantages to our suppliers and customers we design install and manage customized scrap management programs for industrial manufacturing companies

customers we sell various grades of processed ferrous scrap to endusers such as eaf steel mills integrated steelmakers foundries secondary smelters and metal brokers who aggregate materials for other large users ferrous scrap metal is the primary raw material for electric arc furnaces such as our steel mills most of our ferrous scrap customers purchase processed scrap through negotiated spot sales contracts which establish a quantity purchase for the month the price we charge for ferrous scrap depends upon market demand and pricing transportation costs as well as the quality and grade of the scrap 

competition scrap is a global commodity influenced by conditions in a number of industrialized and emerging markets throughout asia europe and north america the markets for scrap metals are highly competitive both in the purchase of raw or unprocessed scrap and the sale of processed scrap with regard to the purchase of unprocessed scrap we compete with numerous independent recyclers as well as smaller scrap companies engaged only in collecting obsolete scrap in many cases we also purchase unprocessed scrap metal from smaller scrap dealers and other processors successful procurement of materials is determined primarily by the price offered by the purchaser for the raw scrap and the proximity of our processing facility to the source of the raw scrap both ferrous and nonferrous scrap sells as a commodity in both domestic and international markets which are affected sometimes significantly by relative economic conditions currency fluctuations and the availability and cost of transportation competition for sales of processed scrap is based primarily on the price quality and location of the scrap metals as well as the level of service provided in terms of reliability and timing of delivery

we also face potential competition for sales of processed scrap from other producers of steel products such as eaf and integrated steel mills some of which like us are also vertically integrated in the scrap metals recycling business in addition other steel mills may compete with us in attempting to secure scrap supply through direct purchasing from our scrap suppliers scrap metal processors also face competition from substitutes for prepared ferrous scrap such as pig iron pelletized iron hot briquetted iron hbi direct reduced iron dri and other forms of processed iron the availability and relative prices of substitutes for ferrous scrap could result in a decreased demand for processed ferrous scrap and could result in lower prices andor lower demand for our scrap products

the industry is highly fragmented with many smaller regional national and global companies which have multiple locations in areas in which omnisource also operates no single scrap metals recycler has a significant market share in the domestic market

sources availability and cost of steel and other operations’ raw materials

scrap metals the principal raw material of our steel operations is scrap metal derived from among other sources home scrap” generated internally at steel mills themselves industrial scrap generated as a byproduct of manufacturing and obsolete scrap recycled from endoflife automobiles appliances and machinery and demolition scrap from obsolete structures containers and machines

ferrous scrap typically comprises more than 80 of the metallic melt mix in eaf steelmaking in contrast to integrated mill steelmaking where the proportion of scrap has traditionally been approximately 25 to 35 depending upon the scrap substitute material that may be available from time to time and the relative cost of such material the percentage of scrap used in our steelmaking operations could be increased or reduced in our metallic melt mix

many variables can impact ferrous scrap prices all of which reflect the pushes and pulls of the supply demand equation these factors include the level of domestic steel production high quality lowresidual scrap is a byproduct of steel manufacturing activity the level of exports of scrap from the united states and the amount of obsolete scrap production in addition domestic ferrous scrap prices generally have a strong correlation and spread to global pig iron pricing generally as domestic steel demand increases so does scrap demand and resulting scrap prices the reverse is also normally but not always true with scrap prices following steel prices downward when supply exceeds demand when scrap prices greatly accelerate this can challenge one of the principal elements of an eaf based steel mill’s traditional lower cost structure—the cost of its metallic raw material ​

iron units in addition to scrap pig iron dri hbi and internally sourced liquid pig iron are used in our eaf steel mill production during 2020 2019 and 2018 we consumed 104 million 106 million and 109 million tons respectively of metallic materials in our steelmaking furnaces of which iron units other than scrap represented approximately 13 of the tons in 2020 and 2019 and 14 in 2018 

energy resources 

electricity electricity is a significant input required in the eafs in our steelmaking operations representing between 4 and 5 of steel production costs of goods sold in 2020 2019 and 2018 we have entered into fixed price electricity contracts for the butler flat roll division columbus flat roll division roanoke bar division and steel of west virginia while our engineered bar products division has a combination of fixed pricing and market pricing for the various components of the electrical services demand charge energy charge riders etc our structural and rail division purchases electricity at current market prices and through fixed price forward contracts

research and development 

our research and development activities have consisted of efforts to expand develop and improve our steel products and operating processes such as our planned southwestsinton flat roll division and our efforts to develop and improve alternative ironmaking technologies most of these research and development efforts have been conducted inhouse by our employees 

environmental matters 

our operations are subject to substantial and evolving local state and federal environmental health and safety laws and regulations concerning among other things emissions to the air discharges to surface and ground water and to sewer systems and the generation handling storage transportation treatment and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes and secondary materials our operations are dependent upon permits regulating discharges into the environment or the use and handling of byproducts in order to operate our facilities we dedicate considerable resources aimed at achieving compliance with federal state and local laws concerning the environment while we do not currently believe that our future compliance efforts with such provisions will have a material adverse effect on our results of operations cash flows or financial condition this is subject to change in the everevolving regulatory environment in which we operate

since the interpretation and enforcement of environmental laws and regulations that may be enacted from time to time are subject to changing social or political pressures our environmental capital expenditures and costs for environmental compliance may increase in the future in addition due to the possibility of unanticipated regulatory or other developments the amount and timing of future environmental expenditures may vary substantially from those currently anticipated the cost of current and future environmental 

compliance may also place united states steel producers at a competitive disadvantage with respect to foreign steel producers which may not be required to undertake equivalent costs in their operations

pursuant to the resource conservation and recovery act rcra which governs the treatment handling and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes the united states environmental protection agency or united states epa and authorized state or local environmental agencies may conduct inspections to identify alleged violations or areas where there may have been releases of solid or hazardous constituents into the environment and require the facilities to take corrective action to address any such releases rcra also allows citizens to bring certain suits against regulated facilities for potential damages and cleanup our steelmaking and certain other facilities generate wastes subject to rcra our operations produce various byproducts some of which for example eaf dust are often categorized as hazardous waste requiring special handling for disposal or for the recovery of metallics we collect such byproducts in pollution control equipment such as baghouses and then recycle what’s possible and appropriately dispose of the remaining unusable byproducts while we cannot predict the future actions of the regulators or other interested parties the potential exists for required corrective action at these facilities the costs of which could be substantial

​ 

under the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act known as cercla or superfund the united states epa state agencies and in some instances private parties have the authority to impose joint and several liability for the remediation of contaminated properties upon generators of waste current and former site owners and operators transporters and other potentially responsible parties regardless of fault or the legality of the original disposal activity many states have statutes and regulatory authorities similar to cercla that can also apply we have a number of material handling agreements with various contractors to properly dispose of or recycle our eaf dust and certain other byproducts of our operations however we cannot assure that even if there has been no fault by us we may not still be cited as a waste generator by reason of an environmental cleanup at a site to which our byproducts were transported

the clean water act and similar state and local laws apply to aspects of our operations and impose regulatory restrictions related to the discharge of wastewater storm water and dredged or fill material the united states epa state agencies and in certain instances private parties have the ability to bring suit alleging violations and seeking penalties and damages the clean water act’s provisions can require new or expanded water treatment investments to be made and can limit or even prohibit certain current or planned activities at our operations

the clean air act and analogous state and local laws require many of our facilities to obtain and maintain air permits in order to operate air permits can impose new or expanded obligations to limit or prevent current or future emissions and to add costly pollution control equipment enforcement for alleged violations can be brought by the united states epa state agencies and in certain instances private parties and can result in substantial penalties and injunctive relief

in addition there are a number of other environmental health and safety laws and regulations that apply to our facilities and may affect our operations by way of example and not of limitation certain portions of the federal toxic substances control act oil pollution act safe drinking water act and emergency planning and community righttoknow act as well as state and local laws and regulations implemented by the regulatory agencies apply to aspects of our facilities’ operations in some instances we may also be subject to foreign governments’ regulations and international treaties and laws many of these laws allow both the governments and citizens to bring certain suits against regulated facilities for alleged environmental violations finally our operations could be subject to certain toxic tort suits brought by citizens or other third parties alleging causes of action such as nuisance negligence trespass infliction of emotional distress or other claims alleging personal injury or property damage

 item 1a risk factors 

many factors may have an effect on our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows we are subject to various risks resulting from changing economic environmental political industry business and financial conditions the factors as may be exacerbated by the impact of the covid19 pandemic described below represent our principal risks 

global and national risks related to our business 

our industry as well as the industries of many of our customers and suppliers upon whom we are dependent is affected by domestic and global economic factors including periods of slower than anticipated economic growth and the risk of a recession 

our financial results are substantially dependent not only upon overall economic conditions in the united states and globally including north america europe and in asia but also as they may affect one or more of the industries upon which we depend for the sale of our products global or domestic actions or conditions including political actions trade policies or restrictions such as the united statesmexicocanada agreement usmca changes in tax laws terrorism natural disasters or pandemics epidemics widespread illness or other health issues such as covid19 could result in changing economic conditions in the united states and globally disruptions to or slowdowns in our business or our global or domestic industry or those of our customers or suppliers upon whom we are dependent additionally periods of slower than anticipated economic growth could reduce customer confidence and adversely affect demand for our products and further adversely affect our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows metals industries have historically been vulnerable to significant declines in consumption and product pricing during periods of economic downturn or continued uncertainty including the pace of domestic nonresidential construction activity

our business is also dependent upon certain industries such as construction automotive manufacturing transportation heavy and agriculture equipment and pipe and tube including octg markets and these industries are also cyclical in nature therefore these industries may experience their own fluctuations in demand for our products based on such things as economic conditions raw material and energy costs consumer demand and infrastructure funding decisions by governments many of these factors are beyond our control as a result of volatility in our industry or in the industries we serve we may have difficulty increasing or maintaining our level of sales or profitability a downturn in our industry or the industries we serve may adversely affect our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows

a prospective decline in consumer and business confidence and spending which is often coupled with reductions in the availability of credit or increased cost of credit as well as volatility in the capital and credit markets may adversely affect the business and economic environment in which we operate and the profitability of our business we are also exposed to risks associated with the creditworthiness of our customers and suppliers if the availability of credit to fund or support the continuation and expansion of our customers’ business operations is curtailed or if the cost of that credit is increased the resulting inability of our customers or of their customers to either access credit or absorb the increased cost of that credit may adversely affect our business by reducing our sales or by increasing our exposure to losses from uncollectible customer accounts a disruption of the credit markets could also result in financial instability of some of our customers and suppliers the consequences of such adverse effects could include the interruption of production at the facilities of our customers the reduction delay or cancellation of customer orders delays or interruptions of the supply of raw materials we purchase and bankruptcy of customers suppliers or other creditors any of these events may adversely affect our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows

global steelmaking overcapacity and imports of steel into the united states have adversely affected and may continue to adversely affect united states steel prices which together with increased scrap prices may adversely affect our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

global steelmaking capacity currently exceeds global consumption of steel products which adversely affects united states and global steel prices such excess capacity sometimes results in steel manufacturers in certain countries exporting steel and steel products including prefabricated long product steel at prices that are lower than prevailing domestic prices and sometimes at or below their cost of production excessive imports of steel and steel products including prefabricated steel into the united states have exerted and may continue to exert downward pressure on united states steel and steel products prices which adversely affects our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows fluctuations in the value of the dollar can also affect imports as strong united states dollar makes imported products less expensive potentially resulting in more imports of steel products into the united states by our foreign competitors furthermore anticipated additional domestic steel capacity could increase this global overcapacity this in turn may also increase domestic demand for ferrous scrap our results of operations financial condition and cash flows are driven primarily from the metal spread achieved from the price we sell steel and steel products compared to the price of our metallic raw materials including scrap during prolonged periods of steel and steel products overcapacity leading to lower selling prices combined with high demand for scrap and raw materials leading to higher buying prices our metal spreads could be compressed which may adversely affect our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows

united states steel producers compete with many foreign producers including those in china vietnam and other asian and european countries competition from foreign producers is typically strong and is periodically exacerbated by weakening of the economies of certain foreign steelmaking countries at times due to imports of steel involving dumping and subsidy abuses by foreign steel producers some foreign steel producers are owned controlled or subsidized by foreign governments as a result decisions by these producers with respect to their production sales and pricing are sometimes influenced to a greater degree by political and economic policy considerations than by prevailing market conditions realities of the marketplace or consideration of profit or loss additionally low iron ore prices resulting in disruption of the scrap price correlation to iron ore leads to reduced global costs to produce steel further depressing steel import prices a higher volume of steel imports into the united states tends to occur at depressed prices when foreign steelmaking countries experience periods of economic difficulty decreased demand for steel products or excess capacity the global steelmaking overcapacity is exacerbated by chinese steel production capacity that far exceeds that country’s demand and has made china a major global exporter of steel resulting in weakened global steel pricing than otherwise would be expected while tariffs pursuant to section 232 of the trade expansion act of 1962 as amended section 232 other measures to curb unfair trade such as duties or quotas and the renegotiation of trade agreements with other countries including the usmca have decreased the volume of steel and steel products imports domestic steel and steel products prices remain negatively impacted by excessive imports of steel and steel products should the section 232 tariffs duties or quotas expire or be relaxed repealed or circumvented by importers of steel and steel products or should trade agreements be renegotiated downward pressure may be exerted on united states steel and steel products prices which may adversely affect our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows

pandemics epidemics widespread illness or other health issues such as the covid19 pandemic may adversely affect our business results of operations financial condition cash flows liquidity and stock price 

the covid19 pandemic has and may continue to adversely affect our business results of operations financial condition cash flows liquidity and stock price other pandemics epidemics widespread illness or other health issues may also adversely affect us the covid19 pandemic has resulted in various government actions globally including united states federal and state governmental actions designed to slow the spread of the virus and its impacts these actions have included quarantines “shelter in place” “stay at home” and “social distancing” orders business shutdowns and restrictions travel restrictions and other mitigation efforts which among other things have impacted and may further impact demand for our products as well as our supply chain these measures along with further voluntary measures by businesses and individuals have impacted and may further impact our working conditions productivity and operations as well as those of our customers and suppliers these mitigation measures have also adversely affected and may continue to adversely affect the united states and global economies resulting in increased unemployment in the united states and the communities in which we operate however due to our variable compensation system that rewards productivity as well as our low fixed cost structure we have not and do not expect in the future to significantly reduce our workforce due to the covid19 pandemic

we have been identified by the us department of homeland security as a critical infrastructure industry and have been deemed an essential business in all of the states in which we operate this has permitted us to continue to advance our commitment to our customers and meet their demand by operating our business consistent with federal guidelines and state and local orders including social distancing guidelines our teams are our most valued priority and we have implemented numerous process and procedural initiatives to ensure the health and safety of our people their families and our communities we have adjusted schedules to support social distancing provided additional and more frequent sanitizing applications provided additional protective measures among many other actions these health and safety initiatives have not and are not expected to have a material effect on our operations but further required limitations and restrictions may adversely affect our results of operations 

additionally while we have not currently curtailed our operations a prolonged covid19 pandemic resurgence or further spread of the virus could further materially reduce demand for our products and thus reduce the productivity of our operations and adversely affect our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows certain of our customers and suppliers such as those in the automotive energy and related industries have experienced and in the future may experience temporary shutdowns or significant demand reductions adversely affecting our operations further reduced demand for our products or raw material supply availability due to shutdowns or slowdowns in businesses may further adversely affect our volumes and margins results of operations financial condition and cash flows in the event equipment or supplier personnel from foreign countries are delayed due to covid19 related constraints our ability to complete construction and commissioning of our new southwestsinton flat roll division could be delayed beyond the expected commencement of operations in midyear 2021 the covid19 pandemic has also caused volatility in the financial and capital markets and led to new and expanded governmental programs and initiatives which affected and may further affect our stock price 

there is considerable uncertainty regarding the economic and industry impacts including duration from the covid19 pandemic and the measures introduced to curtail its spread and its impacts in the event vaccinations for covid19 have unanticipated sideeffects are not widely administered or have more limited than expected benefits the effects of covid19 on the economy and our business could worsen although these highly uncertain future impacts cannot be reasonably estimated at this time 

general economic conditions business closures slow payments from customers increased bankruptcies and labor restrictions may adversely affect our business results of operations financial condition cash flows liquidity and stock price 

industry risks related to our business 

our level of production and our sales and earnings are subject to significant fluctuations as a result of the cyclical nature of the steel industry and some of the industries we serve 

the steel manufacturing business is cyclical in nature and the selling price of the steel we make may fluctuate significantly due to many factors beyond our control furthermore a number of our products are commodities subject to their own cyclical fluctuations in supply and demand in both metal consuming and metal generating industries including the construction and manufacturing industries the timing magnitude and duration of these cycles and the resulting price fluctuations are difficult to predict the sale of our manufactured steel products is directly affected by demand for our products in other cyclical industries such as construction automotive manufacturing transportation heavy and agriculture equipment and pipe and tube including octg markets economic difficulties stagnant or slow global economies supplydemand imbalances and currency fluctuations in the united states or globally may decrease the demand for our products or increase the amount of imports of steel into the united states which may decrease our sales margins and profitability

volatility and major fluctuations in prices and availability of scrap metal scrap substitutes supplies and our potential inability to pass higher costs on to our customers may constrain operating levels and reduce profit margins 

steel producers require large amounts of raw materials including scrap metal and scrap substitute products such as pig iron pelletized iron and other supplies such as zinc graphite electrodes and ferroalloys our principal raw material is scrap metal derived primarily from industrial scrap and endoflife automobiles appliances and machinery and demolition scrap from obsolete structures containers and machinery the prices for scrap are subject to market forces largely beyond our control including demand by united states and foreign steel producers freight costs and speculation the scrap metal recycling industry has historically been and is expected to remain highly cyclical and the prices for scrap have varied significantly in the past may vary significantly in the future and do not necessarily fluctuate in tandem with the price of steel moreover some of our integrated steel producer competitors are not as dependent as we are on scrap as a part of their raw material melt mix which during periods of high scrap costs relative to the cost of blast furnace iron used by the integrated producers give them a raw material cost advantage over eaf mills while our vertical integration into the metals recycling business and our liquid pigiron operations are expected to enable us to continue being a costeffective supplier to our own steelmaking operations for some of our metallics requirements we still rely on other metallics and raw material suppliers as well as upon general industry supply conditions for the balance of our needs

the availability and prices of raw materials and supplies may also be negatively affected by new existing or changing laws and regulations including those that may impose output limitations or higher costs associated with climate change or ghg allocation by suppliers interruptions in production accidents or natural disasters changes in exchange rates global price fluctuations the availability and cost of transportation and competing uses as a major producer of galvanized steel products we purchase and consume a large amount of zinc which if purchased at high prices may adversely affect our profit margins any inability to secure a consistent costeffective and timely supply of our raw materials and supplies may adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows

additionally our inability to pass on all or any substantial part of any cost increases or to provide for our customers’ needs because of the potential unavailability of raw materials or supplies may result in production slowdowns or curtailments or may otherwise adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows

the cost and availability of electricity natural gas oil and other energy resources are subject to volatile market conditions 

steel producers like us consume large amounts of energy to melt ferrous scrap in eafs and reheat steel for rolling into finished products we rely on third parties for the supply of energy resources we consume in our steelmaking activities the prices for and availability of electricity natural gas oil and other energy resources are subject to volatile market conditions often affected by weather conditions as well as political environmental and economic factors beyond our control as consumers of electricity and natural gas we must have dependable delivery in order to operate accordingly we are at risk in the event of an energy disruption including power outages or power unavailability prolonged blackouts or brownouts or disruptions caused by natural disasters or by political or environmental considerations would substantially disrupt our production since a significant portion of our finished steel products are delivered by truck unforeseen fluctuations in the price of fuel would also adversely affect our costs or the costs of many of our customers

compliance with and changes in environmental and remediation requirements may result in substantially increased capital requirements and operating costs 

existing laws or regulations as currently interpreted or as may be interpreted in the future as well as future laws or regulations may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition

we are subject to numerous local state federal and international statutory and regulatory environmental requirements relating to among other things

● the generation storage treatment handling and disposal of solid and hazardous waste and secondary materials

 ● the management treatment and discharge of wastewater and storm water

● the use and treatment of groundwater

● the remediation of soil and groundwater contamination

● climate change legislation or regulation

● the need for and the ability to timely obtain air water or other environmental permits

● the timely reporting of certain chemical usage content storage and releases

● the remediation and reclamation of land used in our operations

● natural resource protections and

● the protection of our employees’ health and safety

compliance with environmental laws and regulations which affect our steelmaking metals recycling liquid pigiron and copper and aluminum production operations is a significant factor in our business we are required to obtain and comply with environmental permits and licenses and failure to obtain or renew or the violation of any permit or license may result in substantial fines and penalties capital expenditures operational changes suspension of operations andor the closure of a subject facility similarly delays increased costs andor the imposition of onerous conditions to the securing or renewal of permits may adversely affect these operations

uncertainty regarding adequate pollution control levels testing and sampling procedures and new pollution control technology are factors that may increase our future compliance expenditures we are unable to predict the ultimate cost of future compliance with environmental requirements or their effect on our operations although we strive to be in substantial compliance with all applicable laws and regulations legal requirements frequently change and are subject to interpretation such that regulatory agencies may bring enforcement actions for alleged noncompliance private parties might also bring claims against us under citizen suit provisions andor for property damage or personal injury allegedly resulting from our operations new laws regulations and changing interpretations by regulatory authorities together with uncertainty regarding the application of existing requirements are among the factors that may increase our future expenditures to comply with environmental requirements the cost of complying with existing laws or regulations as currently interpreted or reinterpreted in the future or with future laws or regulations may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition

our operations produce significant amounts of byproducts some of which are handled as solid or hazardous waste or as hazardous secondary materials for example our steel mills generate eaf dust which the united states environmental protection agency united states epa and other regulatory authorities classify as hazardous waste and regulate accordingly unless recycled in an exempt manner

in addition the primary feed materials for the shredders operated by our metals recycling operations are automobile bodies a portion of the feed materials consist of unrecyclable material known as shredder residue if laws or regulations or the interpretation of the laws or regulations change with regard to eaf dust or shredder residue or other byproducts created by our operations we may incur significant additional expenditures

federal and state environmental laws enable the united states epa state agencies and certain private parties to recover from owners operators generators and transporters the cost of investigation and cleanup of sites at which wastes or hazardous substances were disposed in connection with these laws we may be required to clean up contamination discovered at our sites including 

contamination that may have been caused by former owners or operators of the sites to conduct additional cleanup at sites that have already had some cleanup performed andor to perform cleanup with regard to sites formerly used in connection with our operations

in addition we may be required to pay for or to pay a portion of the costs of cleanup at sites to which we sent materials for disposal or recycling notwithstanding that the original disposal or recycling activity may have complied with all regulatory requirements then in effect under certain laws a party can be held jointly and severally liable for all of the cleanup costs associated with a disposal site in practice a liable party often splits the costs of cleanup with other potentially responsible parties we have received notices from the united states epa state agencies and third parties that we have been identified as potentially responsible for the costs of investigating and cleaning up a number of disposal sites in most cases many other parties are also named as potentially responsible parties and also contribute to payment of those costs

because cleanup liability can in some cases be imposed retroactively on activities that occurred many years ago and because the united states epa and state agencies are still discovering sites that pose a threat to public health or the environment we can provide no assurance that we will not become liable for significant costs associated with investigation and remediation of cleanup sites

increased regulation associated with the environment climate change ghg emissions and sustainability could impose significant costs on both our steelmaking and metals recycling operations 

the united states government various other governmental agencies regulators investors or other groups may introduce request or require environmental monitoring disclosures or regulations in response to the potential impacts of climate change international treaties or agreements may also result in increasing regulation of ghg emissions including the introduction of carbon emissions limitations or trading mechanisms any such regulation or disclosure requirement could impose significant costs on our operations and on the operations of our customers and suppliers including increased energy capital equipment emissions controls environmental monitoring and reporting and other costs in order to comply with current or future laws regulations or demands concerning the environment climate change ghg emissions and sustainability any adopted future regulations could negatively impact our ability and that of our customers and suppliers to compete with companies situated in areas not subject to or not complying with such limitations we may see an increase in costs relating to our assets that emit ghgs as a result of these initiatives which may impact our operations directly or through our customers and suppliers until the timing scope and extent of any future regulation becomes known we cannot predict the effect on our financial condition operating performance and ability to compete

operational and commercial risks related to our business 

we may face significant price and other forms of competition from other steel producers scrap processors and alternative materials which may adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

the global markets in which steel companies and scrap processors conduct business are highly competitive and became even more so due to consolidations in the steel and scrap industries additionally in many applications steel competes with other materials such as aluminum cement composites plastics carbon fiber glass and wood increased use of alternative materials for any reason including as a response to regulations could decrease demand for steel or force other steel producers into new products or markets that compete more directly with us and combined with increased competition could cause us to lose market share increase expenditures or reduce pricing any one of which may adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows

availability of an adequate source of supply is required for our metals recycling operations 

we procure our scrap inventory from numerous sources these suppliers generally are not bound by longterm contracts and generally have no obligation to sell recyclable metal to us in periods of low industry scrap prices scrap suppliers may elect to hold recyclable metal to wait for higher prices or intentionally slow their metal collection activities if a substantial number of scrap suppliers cease selling recyclable metal to us we may be unable to recycle metal at desired levels which may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition in addition a slowdown of industrial production in the united states reduces the supply of industrial grades of metal to the metal recycling industry resulting in our having less recyclable metal available to process and sell

we are subject to cybersecurity threats and may face risks to the security of our sensitive data and information technology which may adversely affect our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

increased global cybersecurity and information technology security requirements vulnerabilities and threats and a rise in sophisticated and targeted cybercrime pose a risk to the security and functionality of our systems and information networks and to the confidentiality availability and integrity of sensitive data including intellectual property proprietary information financial information customer and supplier information and personally identifiable information additionally such cybersecurity 

vulnerabilities or attacks could result in an interruption of the functionality of our automated and electronically controlled manufacturing operating systems which if compromised could cease threaten delay or slow down our ability to melt roll or otherwise process steel or any of our other products for the duration of such interruption our customers and suppliers may also store certain of our sensitive information on their information technology systems which if breached or attacked could likewise expose our sensitive information any of these cybersecurity and information technology breaches or disruptions may result in reputational harm and may adversely affect our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows

although we believe we have adopted procedures and controls to adequately protect our sensitive data networks and information and operating technology and systems there can be no assurance that a system or network failure or cybersecurity breach or attack will be prevented whether due to attacks by cyber criminals or due to employee contractor or other error or malfeasance this could lead to system interruption production delays or downtimes and operational disruptions and the disclosure modification or destruction of sensitive data which may adversely affect our reputation customer and supplier relationships financial results and results of operations and could result in litigation or regulatory investigations actions fines or penalties as well as increased cybersecurity monitoring and protection costs including the cost of insurance additionally as cybersecurity threats continue to evolve and become more sophisticated we may need to invest additional time resources and finances to protect the security of our sensitive data systems and information networks we maintain an information security risk insurance policy to mitigate the impact of cybersecurity threats and we did not incur any net expenses from information security breach penalties and settlements during 2020 2019 or 2018

we may face risks associated with the implementation of our growth strategy 

our growth strategy subjects us to various risks as part of our growth strategy we may expand existing facilities enter into new product or process initiatives acquire or build additional plants acquire other businesses and assets enter into joint ventures or form strategic alliances that we believe will complement our existing business these expansions and transactions may involve some or all of the following risks

● the risk of entering product or domestic or foreign geographic markets in which we have little experience

● the risk of a newly constructed steel mill being completed over budget or not on time

● the risk of not being able to adequately obtain sufficient labor to efficiently build or staff a new steel mill

 ● the inability to realize anticipated synergies or other expected benefits

● the difficulty of integrating new or acquired operations and personnel into our existing operations

● the potential disruption of ongoing operations

● the diversion of financial resources or management attention to new operations or acquired businesses

● the loss of key employees customers or suppliers of acquired businesses

● the potential exposure to unknown liabilities

● the inability of management to maintain uniform standards controls procedures and policies

● the difficulty of managing the growth of a larger company

 ● the risk of becoming more highly leveraged

● the risk of contractual or operational liability to other venture participants or to third parties as a result of our participation

● the inability to work efficiently with joint venture or strategic alliance partners and

● the difficulties of terminating joint ventures or strategic alliances

2020 overview

impact of covid19 on our business 

in march 2020 the world health organization categorized covid19 as a pandemic and since that time efforts to slow the contagion have impacted domestic and global economies countries including the united states issued “shelter in place” orders temporarily closing nonessential businesses and restricting social interactions in an effort to slow the spread of covid19 states began to reopen during the second quarter 2020 and domestic manufacturing started to improve 

steelmaking and its ancillary support businesses are considered a “critical infrastructure industry” by the us department of homeland security and we have been deemed an essential busines in all of the states in which we operate as a result all of our locations continued to operate during all of 2020 and continue to operate 

our teams are our most valued priority and we have implemented numerous additional process and procedural initiatives to ensure the health and safety of our people their families and our communities we adjusted schedules to support social distancing provided additional and more frequent sanitizing applications provided additional protective measures among many other actions 

results overview 

while our consolidated results for 2020 represented our fourth best year based on net income we were negatively impacted in the second quarter by the continuing effects of covid19 due to the related temporary closures of numerous domestic steel consuming businesses this largely reversed during the third quarter as most manufacturing activity resumed throughout the remainder of the year domestic steel demand rebounded meaningfully during the third and fourth quarters of 2020 driving higher steel shipments as well as significantly higher scrap flows and profitability for our steel and metals recycling operations the nonresidential construction market remained strong with construction activity largely intact resulting in record 2020 shipments and operating income for our steel fabrication operations

consolidated operating income for 2020 decreased 1397 million or 14 to 8471 million compared to 9869 million in 2019 net income attributable to steel dynamics inc for 2020 decreased 1203 million or 18 to 5508 million compared to 2019 diluted earnings per share attributable to steel dynamics inc was 259 for 2020 compared to 304 for 2019

​ 

segment results 2020 vs 2019

covid19 negatively impacted our steel operations during 2020 most notably in the second quarter domestic steel demand and raw material supply were robust early in the year but demand from many steel consuming industries and scrap generation significantly reduced during the second quarter 2020 as the automotive sector and its supply chain temporarily closed as a result a significant amount of highercost domestic steel production was idled as travel restrictions and stay at home orders were lifted and the broader manufacturing base restarted midyear steel demand quickly recovered resulting in steel operations segment shipments decreasing only 1 in 2020 as compared to 2019 reflecting the overall strong steel demand environment as demand improved in the second half of 2020 some domestic steel production remained idled when coupled with extremely low steel inventory levels throughout the supply chain flat roll steel index prices increased over 500 per ton from august through the end of the year however overall steel segment operations average selling prices decreased 8 or 69 per ton in 2020 compared to 2019 net sales for the steel operations segment decreased 9 in 2020 when compared to 2019 due to the 8 decrease in average steel selling prices and minimal decline in shipments

​ 

metallic raw materials used in our eafs represent our single most significant steel manufacturing cost generally comprising approximately 50 to 60 of our steel mill operations’ manufacturing costs our metallic raw material cost per net ton consumed in our steel mills decreased 25 or 9 in 2020 compared to 2019

​ 

as a result of average selling prices decreasing more than scrap costs metal spread which we define as the difference between average steel selling prices and the cost of ferrous scrap consumed in our steel mills decreased 8 in 2020 compared to 2019 due to this metal spread contraction coupled with the slight decrease in shipments operating income for the steel operations decreased 14 to 8895 million in 2020 compared to 2019

metals recycling operations includes both ferrous and nonferrous scrap metal processing transportation marketing brokerage and scrap management services in august 2020 we completed the acquisition of zimmer whose postacquisition operations are included in 2020 results our steel mills utilize a large portion approximately 69 in 2020 and 66 in 2019 of the ferrous scrap sold by our metals recycling operations as raw material in our steelmaking operations and the remainder is sold to other consumers such as other steel manufacturers and foundries metals recycling operations accounted for 11 of our consolidated net sales during 2020 and 2019

metals recycling operations shipments

 ​ 

segment results 2020 vs 2019

as stated previously our metals recycling operations benefitted from a rebound in manufacturing in steel consuming industries during the second half of 2020 scrap flows increased as temporary closures of domestic automotive and other steel consuming manufacturers and their related supply chain were lifted in addition domestic steel mill utilization rates rose from the trough experienced in the second quarter 2020 resulting in increased ferrous scrap demand and significantly higher selling prices however net sales for our metals recycling operations decreased 4 in 2020 as compared to 2019 as total annual shipments decreased most notably in the second quarter ferrous scrap average selling prices increased 10 during 2020 compared to 2019 while nonferrous pricing was flat year over year ferrous metal spread which we define as the difference between average selling prices and the cost of purchased scrap increased 27 while nonferrous metal spread decreased 4 in 2020 compared to 2019 metals recycling operations operating income in 2020 of 330 million increased 102 from 2019 operating income of 163 million due to ferrous metal spread expansion and positive operating results from our zimmer acquisition which more than offset decreases in ferrous and nonferrous shipments

​ 

 ​ 

steel fabrication operations include seven new millennium building systems joist and deck plants located throughout the united states and in northern mexico revenues from these plants are generated from the fabrication of steel joists trusses girders and steel deck used within the nonresidential construction industry steel fabrication operations accounted for 9 of our consolidated net sales during 2020 and 2019

​ 

​ 

​ 

segment results 2020 vs 2019

net sales for the steel fabrication operations decreased 569 million or 6 during 2020 compared to 2019 as shipments increased 3 to a record 666000 tons while average selling prices decreased 133 per ton or 9 as our steel fabrication operations continue to leverage our national operating footprint market demand orders and backlog continued to be strong in 2020 indicating resilience of the nonresidential construction market during covid19 

the purchase of various steel products is the largest single cost of production for our steel fabrication operations generally representing approximately twothirds of the total cost of manufacturing the average cost of steel consumed decreased by 14 in 2020 as compared to 2019 consistent with decreased steel selling prices in our steel operations average selling prices decreased 9 with resulting metal spread which we define as the difference between average selling prices and the cost of purchased steel decreasing 2 as the decrease in selling prices per ton outpaced the decrease in the cost of purchased steel operating income increased 15 million to a record 1206 million in 2020 compared to 2019 as increased shipments more than offset decreased metal spread

​ 

 ​ 

consolidated results 2020 vs 2019

selling general and administrative expenses selling general and administrative expenses increased 9 or 410 million to 4775 million during 2020 compared to 2019 representing 50 and 42 of net sales respectively this increase relates primarily to noncapitalized expenses incurred during construction of our new southwestsinton flat roll division profit sharing expense was 617 million in 2020 a decrease of 163 million from the 780 million earned during 2019 the companywide profit sharing plan represents 8 of pretax earnings therefore our lower 2020 earnings resulted in lower profit sharing

interest expense net of capitalized interest during 2020 interest expense of 949 million decreased 322 million from the 1271 million incurred during 2019 due to decreased interest rates from our december 2019 june 2020 and october 2020 refinancing of 195 billion of high yield senior notes with lower interest senior notes and increased capitalized interest in 2020 in conjunction with construction of our new southwestsinton flat roll division

other income expense net net other expense of 468 million in 2020 included 331 million of costs of premiums write off of unamortized debt issuance costs and other expenses related to the call and redemption of our 5 14 senior notes due 2023 5500 senior notes due 2024 and 4125 senior notes due 2025 net other income of 156 million in 2019 included interest income of 280 million associated with our invested cash and shortterm investments compared to only 90 million in 2020 due to lower interest rates on decreasing invested cash and shortterm investment balances in 2020

income tax expense during 2020 income tax expense of 1347 million representing an effective income tax rate of 191 was down 32 from 1974 million representing an effective income tax rate of 226 during 2019 consistent with decreased income before income taxes the decrease in effective tax rate in 2020 relates primarily to the release of deferred tax asset valuation allowance and increased federal tax credits refer to note 4 income taxes to the consolidated financial statements elsewhere in this report for additional information

included in the balance of unrecognized tax benefits at december 31 2020 are potential benefits of 90 million that if recognized would affect the effective tax rate we recognize interest and penalties related to our tax contingencies on a netoftax basis in income tax expense during the year ended december 31 2020 we recognized benefits from the decrease of interest expense and penalties of 450000 net of tax in addition to the unrecognized tax benefits noted above we had 828000 accrued for the payment of interest and penalties at december 31 2020

we file income tax returns in the united states federal jurisdiction as well as income tax returns in various state jurisdictions the tax years 2017 through 2019 remain open to examination by the internal revenue service and various state and local jurisdictions at this time we do not believe there will be any significant examination adjustments that would result in a material change to our financial position results of operations or cash flows it is reasonably possible that the amount of unrecognized tax benefits could change in the next twelve months in an amount ranging from zero to 33 million as a result of the expiration of the statute of limitations and other federal and state income tax audits

liquidity and capital resources

capital resources and longterm debt our business is capital intensive and requires substantial expenditures for among other things the purchase and maintenance of equipment used in our steel metals recycling and steel fabrication operations and to remain in compliance with environmental laws our shortterm and longterm liquidity needs arise primarily from working capital requirements capital expenditures currently including those related to our new southwestsinton flat roll division principal and interest payments related to our outstanding indebtedness no significant principal payments until 2024 dividends to our shareholders potential stock repurchases and acquisitions we have met these liquidity requirements primarily with cash provided by operations and longterm borrowings and we also have availability under our unsecured revolver our liquidity at december 31 2020 is as follows in thousands

 ​ 

our total outstanding debt increased 3683 million during 2020 due to our october 2020 issuance of the 2027 notes and 2050 notes as described below our total longterm debt to capitalization ratio representing our longterm debt including current maturities divided by the sum of our longterm debt redeemable noncontrolling interests and our total stockholders’ equity was 416 and 402 at december 31 2020 and december 31 2019 respectively

our unsecured credit agreement has a senior unsecured revolving credit facility facility which provides a 12 billion unsecured revolver and matures in december 2024 subject to certain conditions we have the opportunity to increase the facility size by 5000 million the unsecured revolver is available to fund working capital capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes the facility contains financial covenants and other covenants pertaining to our ability to incur indebtedness and permit liens on property our ability to borrow funds within the terms of the unsecured revolver is dependent upon our continued compliance with the financial and other covenants at december 31 2020 we had 12 billion of availability on the revolver 119 million of outstanding letters of credit and other obligations which reduce availability and there were no borrowings outstanding

the financial covenants under our facility state that we must maintain an interest coverage ratio of not less than 250100 our interest coverage ratio is calculated by dividing our lasttwelvemonths ltm consolidated adjusted ebitda earnings before interest taxes depreciation amortization and certain other noncash transactions as allowed in the facility by our ltm gross interest expense less amortization of financing fees in addition a debt to capitalization ratio of not more than 060100 must be maintained at december 31 2020 our interest coverage ratio and debt to capitalization ratio were 1071100 and 042100 

respectively we were therefore in compliance with these covenants at december 31 2020 and we anticipate we will continue to be in compliance during the next twelve months

in october 2020 we issued 3500 million of 1650 notes due 2027 and 4000 million of 3250 notes due 2050 the net proceeds from these notes were used to fund the november 2020 call and redemption of the 3500 million outstanding principal amount of our 4125 senior notes due 2025 at a redemption price of 102063  plus accrued and unpaid interest to but not including the date of redemption and for general corporate purposes we recorded expenses related to premiums and write off of unamortized debt issuance costs of approximately 103 million which are reflected in other expenses in the consolidated statement of income for the year ended december 31 2020

in june 2020 we issued 4000 million of 2400 notes due 2025 and 5000 million of 3250 notes due 2031 the net proceeds from these notes were used to fund the june 2020 call and redemption of the 4000 million outstanding principal amount of our 5 14 senior notes due 2023 at a redemption price of 100875 and the 5000 million outstanding principal amount of our 5500 senior notes due 2024 at a redemption price of 102750 plus accrued and unpaid interest to but not including the date of redemption we recorded expenses related to premiums write off of unamortized debt issuance costs and other expenses of approximately 228 million which are reflected in other expenses in the consolidated statement of income for the year ended december 31 2020

working capital we generated cash flow from operations of 9870 million in 2020 operational working capital representing amounts invested in trade receivables and inventories less current liabilities other than income taxes payable and debt increased 506 million 3 to 17 billion at december 31 2020 consistent with increased sales during the fourth quarter of 2020 as compared to the fourth quarter of 2019

capital investments during 2020 we invested 12 billion in property plant and equipment primarily within our steel operations segment compared with 4519 million invested during 2019 the increase in 2020 versus 2019 primarily relates to our new southwestsinton flat roll division which represented 9277 million in 2020 we enter 2021 with sufficient liquidity of 26 billion to provide for our planned 2021 capital requirements including those necessary to finish construction of our new steel mill in sinton texas

cash dividends as a reflection of continued confidence in our current and future cash flow generation ability and financial position we increased our quarterly cash dividend by 4 to 025 per share in the first quarter 2020 from 024 per share in 2019 resulting in declared cash dividends of 2105 million during 2020 compared to 2095 million during 2019 we paid cash dividends of 2092 million and 2003 million during 2020 and 2019 respectively our board of directors along with executive management approves the payment of dividends on a quarterly basis the determination to pay cash dividends in the future is at the discretion of our board of directors after taking into account various factors including our financial condition results of operations outstanding indebtedness current and anticipated cash needs and growth plans

other in february 2020 our board of directors authorized a share repurchase program of up to 500 million of our common stock subsequent to the completion of a 2018 board authorized share repurchase program of up to 750 million of our common stock during the first quarter of 2020 under the share repurchase programs purchases take place as and when we determine in open market or private transactions made based upon the market price of our common stock the nature of other investment opportunities or growth projects our cash flows from operations and general economic conditions the 2020 share repurchase program does not require us to acquire any specific number of shares and may be modified suspended extended or terminated by us at any time the 2020 share repurchase program does not have an expiration date we repurchased 44 million shares of our common stock for 1065 million during 2020 all within the first quarter fully expending the remaining purchases available under the 2018 program leaving 4440 million remaining available to purchase under the 2020 program see part ii item 5 market for registrant’s common equity related stockholder matters and issuer purchases of equity securities for additional information

our ability to meet our debt service obligations and reduce our total debt will depend upon our future performance which in turn will depend upon general economic financial business and ongoing covid19 conditions along with competition legislation and regulatory factors that are largely beyond our control in addition we cannot assure that our operating results cash flows access to credit markets and capital resources will be sufficient for repayment of our indebtedness in the future we believe that based upon current levels of operations and anticipated growth cash flows from operations together with other available sources of funds including borrowings under our revolver if necessary will be adequate for the next twelve months for making required payments of principal and interest on our indebtedness funding working capital requirements and anticipated capital expenditures noted above

​

other matters

inflation

we believe that inflation has not had a material effect on our results of operations

environmental and other contingencies

we have incurred and in the future will continue to incur capital expenditures and operating expenses for matters relating to environmental control remediation monitoring and compliance during 2020 we incurred costs related to the monitoring and compliance of environmental matters in the amount of approximately 340 million and capital expenditures related to environmental compliance of approximately 873 million of which approximately 837 million is related to the construction of our new southwestsinton flat roll division of the costs incurred during 2020 for monitoring and compliance approximately 70 were related to the normal transportation of certain types of waste produced in our steelmaking processes and other facilities in accordance with legal requirements we incurred combined environmental remediation costs of approximately 24 million at all of our facilities during 2020 we have an accrual of 60 million recorded for environmental remediation related to our metals recycling operations and 26 million related to our idled minnesota ironmaking operations we believe apart from our dependence on environmental construction and operating permits for our existing and any future manufacturing facilities that compliance with current environmental laws and regulations is not likely to have a materially adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or liquidity however environmental laws and regulations evolve and change and we may become subject to more stringent environmental laws and regulations in the future such as the impact of united states government or various governmental agencies introducing regulatory changes in response to the potential of climate change

critical accounting policies and estimates

management’s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states we review the accounting policies we use in reporting our financial results on a regular basis the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent liabilities we evaluate the appropriateness of these estimations and judgments on an ongoing basis we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources results may differ from these estimates due to actual outcomes being different from those on which we based our assumptions we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements

revenue recognition and credit losses except for our steel fabrication operations we recognize revenues at the point in time the performance obligation is satisfied and control of the product is transferred to the customer upon shipment or delivery at the amount of consideration the company expects to receive including any variable consideration the variable consideration included in the company’s steel operations segment contracts which is not constrained include estimated product returns and customer claims based on historical experience and may include volume rebates which are recorded on an expected value basis our steel fabrication operations segment recognizes revenue over time at the amount of consideration the company expects to receive revenue is measured on an output method representing completed fabricated tons to date as a percentage of total tons required for each contract the company does not exercise significant judgements in determining the timing of satisfaction of performance obligations or the transaction price provision is made for estimated product returns and customer claims based on historical experience if the historical data used in our estimates does not reflect future returns and claims trends additional provision may be necessary the allowance for credit losses for accounts receivable is based on our reasonable estimate of known credit risks and historical experience adjusted for current and anticipated economic and other pertinent factors affecting our customers that may differ from historical experience

we are exposed to credit risk in the event of nonpayment by our customers which in steel operations are principally intermediate steel processors and service centers that sell our products to numerous industry sectors including the construction automotive manufacturing transportation heavy and agriculture equipment and pipe and tube including octg markets our metals recycling operations sell ferrous scrap to steel mills and foundries and nonferrous scrap such as copper brass aluminum and stainless steel to among others ingot manufacturers copper refineries and mills smelters and specialty mills our steel fabrication operations sell fabricated steel joists and deck primarily to the nonresidential construction market we mitigate our exposure to credit risk which we generally extend initially on an unsecured basis by performing ongoing credit evaluations and taking further action when necessary such as requiring letters of credit or other security interests to support the customer receivable if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate for any reason including the impact of covid19 on operations resulting in the impairment of their ability to make payments additional allowance may be required

inventories we record inventories at lower of cost or net realizable value cost is determined using a weighted average cost method for raw materials and supplies and on a firstin firstout basis for other inventory we record amounts required if any to reduce the carrying value of inventory to its net realizable value as a charge to cost of goods sold if product selling prices were to decline in future periods further writedown of inventory could result specifically raw material inventory such as scrap purchased during periods of peak market pricing

impairments of longlived tangible and definitelived intangible assets we review longlived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of such assets may not be fully recoverable impairment losses are recorded on longlived assets used in operations when indicators of impairment are present and the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than the assets’ carrying amounts the impairment loss is measured by comparing the fair value of the asset to its carrying amount we consider various factors and determine whether an impairment test is necessary including by way of examples a significant and prolonged deterioration in operating results andor projected cash flows significant changes in the extent or manner in which an asset is used technological advances with respect to assets which would potentially render them obsolete our strategy and capital planning and the economic climate in markets to be served when determining future cash flows and if necessary fair value we must make judgments as to the expected utilization of assets and estimated future cash flows related to those assets we consider historical and anticipated future results general economic and market conditions the impact of planned business and operational strategies and all other available information at the time the estimates are made those estimates and judgments may or may not ultimately prove accurate

a longlived asset is classified as held for sale upon meeting specified criteria related to ability and intent to sell an asset classified as held for sale is measured at the lower of its carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell as of december 31 2020 and 2019 the company reported 72 million and 80 million respectively of assets held for sale within other current assets in our consolidated balance sheet an impairment loss is recognized for any initial or subsequent writedown of the asset held for sale to its fair value less cost to sell for assets determined to be classified as held for sale in the year ended december 31 2020 and 2019 the asset carrying amounts approximated their fair value less cost to sell the company determined fair value using level 3 fair value inputs as provided for under asc 820 consisting of information provided by brokers and other external sources along with management’s own assumptions

events occurred during the fourth quarter of 2020 that represented impairment indicators related to the company’s noncore oil and gas joint ventures therefore the company undertook a fourth quarter 2020 assessment of the recoverability of the carrying amounts of these joint ventures’ property plant and equipment based on the joint ventures’ outlook at the time of this 2020 assessment the company concluded that the carrying amounts of its property plant and equipment were fully impaired this assessment resulted in a total noncash asset impairment charge of 194 million which include amounts attributable to noncontrolling interests of 24 that in total served to reduce net income attributable to steel dynamics inc by 120 million for the year ended december 31 2020 

goodwill

our goodwill relating to various business combinations consisted of the following at december 31 in thousands

​ 

 ​ 

at least once annually as of october 1 or when indicators of impairment exist the company performs an impairment test for goodwill goodwill is allocated to various reporting units which are generally one level below the company’s operating segments the fair value of the reporting unit is determined by using an estimate of future cash flows utilizing a riskadjusted discount rate to calculate the net present value of future cash flows income approach and by using a market approach based upon an analysis of valuation metrics of comparable peer companies using level 3 fair value inputs as provided for under asc 820 if the fair value exceeds the carrying value of the reporting unit there is no impairment if the carrying amount exceeds the fair value we recognize an impairment loss in the amount by which the carrying value of the net assets assigned to the reporting unit exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit with the impairment loss not to exceed the amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit 

​ 

key assumptions used to determine the estimated fair value of each reporting unit under the discounted cash flows method income approach include a expected cash flows for the fiveyear period following the testing date including market share sales volumes and prices costs to produce and estimated capital needs b an estimated terminal value using a terminal year growth rate determined based on the growth prospects of the reporting unit and c a riskadjusted discount rate based on management’s best estimate of market participants’ aftertax weighted average cost of capital and market risk premiums key assumptions used to determine the estimated fair value of each reporting unit under the market approach include the expected revenues and cash flows in the next year we consider historical and anticipated future results general economic and market conditions the impact of planned business and operational strategies and all available information at the time the fair values of its reporting units are estimated those estimates and judgments may or may not ultimately prove accurate

goodwill acquired in past transactions are naturally more susceptible to impairment primarily due to the fact that they are recorded at fair value based on operating plans and economic conditions at the time of acquisition consequently if operating results andor economic conditions deteriorate after an acquisition it could result in the impairment of the acquired assets a deterioration of economic conditions may not only negatively impact the estimated operating cash flows used in our cash flow models but may also negatively impact other assumptions used in our analyses including but not limited to the estimated cost of capital andor discount rates additionally we are required to ensure that assumptions used to determine fair value in our analyses are consistent with the assumptions a hypothetical marketplace participant would use as a result the cost of capital andor discount rates used in our analyses may increase or decrease based on market conditions and trends regardless of whether our actual cost of capital has changed therefore we may recognize an impairment in spite of realizing actual cash flows that are approximately equal to or greater than our previously forecasted amounts

our fourth quarter 2020 2019 and 2018 annual goodwill impairment analyses did not result in any impairment charges management does not believe that it is reasonably likely that our reporting units will fail the goodwill impairment test in the near term as the determined fair value of the reporting units with goodwill exceeded their carrying value by more than an insignificant amount we will continue to monitor operating results within all reporting units throughout the upcoming year to determine if events and circumstances warrant interim impairment testing otherwise all reporting units will again be subject to the required annual impairment test during the fourth quarter of 2021 changes in judgments and estimates underlying our analysis of goodwill for possible impairment including expected future operating cash flows and discount rate could decrease the estimated fair value of our reporting units in the future and could result in an impairment of goodwill

income taxes we are required to estimate our income taxes as a part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements this requires us to estimate our actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatments of items for tax and accounting purposes these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities which are included within our consolidated balance sheet we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely we must establish a valuation allowance we also establish reserves to reduce some or all of the tax benefit of any of our tax positions at the time we determine that the positions become uncertain we adjust these reserves including any impact on the related interest and penalties in light of changing facts and circumstances such as the progress of a tax audit a number of years may elapse before a particular matter for which we have established a reserve is audited by a taxing authority and finally resolved the number of years with open tax audits varies depending on the tax jurisdiction the tax benefit that has been previously reserved because of a failure to meet the more likely than not recognition threshold would be recognized in our income tax expense in the first interim period when the uncertainty disappears settlement of any particular issue would usually require the use of cash




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk

market risk

in the normal course of business we are exposed to interest rate changes our objectives in managing fluctuations in interest rates are to limit the impact of these rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower overall borrowing costs to achieve these objectives we may use interest rate swaps to manage net exposure to interest rate changes related to our portfolio of borrowings however we have not done so during 2020 2019 or 2018

​ 

the following table represents the principal cash repayments and related weightedaverage interest rates by maturity date for our longterm debt as of december 31 2020 in thousands

 ​ 

commodity risk

in the normal course of business we are exposed to the market risk and price fluctuations related to the sale of our products and to the purchase of raw materials used in our operations such as metallic raw materials electricity natural gas and its transportation services fuel air products zinc and electrodes our risk strategy associated with product sales has generally been to obtain competitive prices for our products and to allow operating results to reflect market price movements dictated by supply and demand

our risk strategy associated with the purchase of raw materials utilized within our operations has generally been to make some commitments with suppliers relating to future expected requirements for some commodities such as electricity water natural gas and its transportation services fuel air products zinc and electrodes certain of these commitments contain provisions which require us to “take or pay” for specified quantities without regard to actual usage for periods of generally up to 5 years for physical commodity requirements and commodity transportation requirements with some extending beyond and for up to 12 years for air products our commitments for these arrangements with “take or pay” or other similar commitment provisions for the years ending december 31 are as follows in thousands

​ 

 ​ 

we utilized such “take or pay” requirements during the past three years under these contracts except for certain air products at our idle minnesota ironmaking operations we believe that production requirements will be such that consumption of the products or services purchased under these commitments will occur in the normal production process other than certain air products related to our idled minnesota ironmaking operations

in our metals recycling and steel operations we have certain fixed price contracts with various customers and suppliers for future delivery of nonferrous and ferrous metals our risk strategy has been to enter into base metal financial contracts with the goal to protect the profit margin within certain parameters that was contemplated when we entered into the transaction with the customer or vendor at december 31 2020 we had a cumulative unrealized loss associated with these financial contracts of 645000 substantially all of which have settlement dates in 2021 we believe the customer contracts associated with the financial contracts will be fully consummated

steel fabrication operations steel joists girders and steel deck including specialty deck our steel fabrication operations provide “pullthrough” volume optionality for our steel operations as many of the products that we make utilize our own internally produced steel 

this diversified portfolio of products enables us to access a broad range of markets serve a large customer base and helps mitigate our market exposure to any one product or sector resulting in increased throughcycle steel mill utilization in addition our valueadded steel product offerings help to balance our exposure to commodity grade products supplied by other manufacturers we will continue to seek additional opportunities and to collaborate with our customers to anticipate their future needs by further expanding our range of products and offerings which may allow our customers the ability to more effectively and efficiently navigate their supply chain 

one such opportunity is our planned 19 billion “nextgeneration” electric arc furnace eaf flat roll steel mill – southwestsinton flat roll division our new steel mill will have an estimated 30 million tons of annual steel production capacity including valueadded coating lines comprised of a galvanizing line with planned annual coating capacity of 550000 tons with galvalume capability and a paint line with annual coating capacity of 250000 tons by leveraging our construction and operating expertise we are building a “nextgeneration” eaf flat roll steel mill with planned production capabilities beyond existing eaf flat roll steel producers competing even more effectively with the integrated steel model and foreign competition our new steel mill will have the capability to provide higherstrength tougher grades of flat roll steel for the energy and automotive markets these ultrahighstrength steel products are not currently readily available from other domestic steel producers by locating our new steel mill in sinton texas we are strategically targeting underserved markets that are largely reliant on imports with long lead times and lower product quality capabilities providing customers throughout the southwest united states and mexico significant freight benefits and shorter lead times allowing them to realize working capital advantages additionally our new steel mill site has sufficient acreage to allow for customers to locate onsite providing them with logistics savings and our steel mill with volume baseloading opportunities based on current expectations operations are planned to begin mid2021 

one of the lowest cost steel producers in the united states stateoftheart facilities  allowing for low production costs

we are focused on maintaining one of the lowest operating cost structures in the north american steel industry our low operating costs are primarily a result of our efficient plant designs and operations our high productivity rate low ongoing maintenance cost requirements and strategic locations near our customers and sources of our primary raw material ferrous scrap

we will continue to develop innovative ways to use our equipment enhance our productivity and explore new technologies to further improve our unit costs of production at each of our facilities as one of the lowest cost producers in each of our three primary operating segments we are able to better manage through all market cycles and to consistently maximize our profitability we continuously seek to maximize the variability of our cost structure and to reduce per unit and fixed costs our highly performancebased incentive compensation plans at all employee levels are based on both divisional and consolidated company performance performancebased incentive compensation is designed to reward high productivity and efficient use of physical resources and capital 

employed additionally effectively leveraging our existing facilities through capital effective organic growth and diversified product offerings allows us to maximize utilization

secure supply of high quality justintime ferrous raw materials

we maintain a secure supply of ferrous raw material resources through the benefit of our metals recycling operations and iron dynamics idi ferrous materials represent the single largest raw material component of our steel operations’ manufacturing costs at approximately 55 to 60 percent of such costs during 2019 2018 and 2017 omnisource our metals recycling operations provided our steel operations with 37 39 and 38 respectively of its ferrous scrap requirements this represented 66 65 and 63 of omnisource’s total ferrous scrap shipments during 2019 2018 and 2017 respectively during 2019 2018 and 2017 our steel operations consumed 106 million 109 million and 103 million tons respectively of metallic materials of which iron units other than scrap represented approximately 13 in 2019 and 2017 and 14 in 2018 idi supplies 100 of its production to the butler flat roll division representing 63 64 and 72 of their iron units other than scrap in 2019 2018 and 2017 respectively through the transfer of liquid pig iron and hot briquetted iron which are higher quality energysaving ferrous raw materials we believe our metals recycling operations and idi provide us with a high quality cost effective and secure raw material platform for effective working capital management

strategic geographic locations  enter new geographic markets

the majority of our steelmaking operations are in locations near sustainable sources of scrap materials and near our customer base allowing us to realize freight savings for inbound scrap as well as for outbound steel products destined for our customers this also allows us to provide consistent ontime delivery to our customer base with relatively short lead times further solidifying our customer relationships recycled ferrous scrap and iron units represent the most significant component of our cost of steel manufacturing approximately threefourths of our recycled ferrous scrap needs are sourced within 250 miles of our steel mill locations minimizing the amount of energy expended on transportation we believe that our metals recycling facilities are in the regions that account for a majority of the total ferrous scrap produced in the united states our steel fabrication operations have a national footprint allowing us to serve the entire joist and deck domestic market and national accounts 

sustainability 

we have had a focus toward sustainability since our inception valuing our teams partners and communities while producing steel using eaf technology which utilizes recycled ferrous scrap as the primary raw material requiring the use of far fewer natural resources and consuming significantly less energy than traditional blast furnace technology resulting in lower levels of air emissions and much less environmental impact for melting and casting steel our energy intensity for our six eaf steel mills is only approximately 11 of the world steel association average energy intensity our co 2 emissions from our six eaf steel mills are only approximately 13 of the world steel association average co 2 emissions we reuse over 99 of our total system water demand 

we have continuously innovated further strengthening our company becoming vertically connected with a looped manufacturing life cycle we are one of the largest ferrous and nonferrous scrap metals recyclers in the united states our metals recycling platform collects and processes industrial scrap from manufacturers and obsolete scrap derived from endoflife items such as automobiles appliances and machinery this processed scrap is then sold to end users including our electric arc furnace steel mills our steel mills utilize recycled ferrous scrap as their primary raw material input to produce new steel our steel is then sold internally to our steel manufacturing operations and to external steel customers 

through our vertically connected manufacturing life cycle we reintroduced 11 billion pounds of recycled nonferrous scrap and 11 million tons of recycled ferrous scrap into the manufacturing life cycle in 2019 additionally our vertically connected manufacturing life cycle allowed for 14 million tons of our steel to be used internally 

at steel dynamics we recognize the importance of being good stewards of our environment and the communities where we work and live we continually evaluate opportunities to improve our processes equipment and technology to reduce our physical impact on the environment to us it is more than simply meeting applicable requirements but going beyond with a commitment to higher environmental standards both our butler and columbus flat roll divisions’ environmental management systems are certified with the international organization for standardization 14001 these facilities represent over 65 of our 2019 steel production 

each of our steel mills has an environmental engineering group focused on regulatory compliance and our employ­ees are trained on how to properly handle waste streams and engage in responsible environmental practices being environmentally conscious is part of our culture we see ourselves as members of the communities in which we do business every day our teams take the initiative to protect the environment simply because it is the right thing to do

experienced leadership team and unique culture  foster entrepreneurial culture 

our senior leadership team is highly experienced and has a proven track record in the steel metals recycling and steel fabrication industries our leadership objectives are closely aligned with our stockholders through meaningful stock ownership positions and performancebased incentive compensation programs that are correlated to the company’s profitability and operational performance in relationship to its steel manufacturing peers our entrepreneurial culture resonates throughout each of our operating segments we emphasize decentralized decision making with corporate risk oversight and have established incentive compensation programs specifically designed to reward our individual teams for their efforts toward identifying innovative ways to enhance productivity improve profitability and control costs

steel competition the markets in which we conduct business are highly competitive with an abundance of competition in the carbon steel industry from north american and foreign integrated and minimill steelmaking and processing operations we compete in numerous industry sections most significantly tied to the construction automotive and other manufacturing sectors in many applications within these industry sections steel competes with other materials such as aluminum cement composites plastics carbon fiber glass and wood some of our products are commodities subject to their own cyclical fluctuations in supply and demand however we are focused on providing a broader range of diversified valueadded products that deemphasize commodity steel the primary competitive influences on products we sell are price quality and valueadded services



​ 

the metals recycling operations consists solely of omnisource and includes both ferrous and nonferrous scrap metal processing transportation marketing and brokerage services strategically located primarily in close proximity to our steel mills and other enduser scrap consumers throughout the eastern half of the united states in addition omnisource designs installs and manages customized scrap management programs for industrial manufacturing companies at hundreds of locations throughout north america our metals recycling operations accounted for 11 13 and 15 of our consolidated net sales during 2019 2018 and 2017 respectively our steel mills utilize a large portion approximately 65 of the ferrous scrap sold by omnisource as raw material in our steelmaking operations and the remainder is sold to other consumers this strategic symbiotic relationship with our own steelmaking operations provides valuable pullthrough demand to omnisource’s ferrous scrap operations in 2019 2018 and 2017 omnisource provided our steel operations with 37 39 and 38 respectively of its ferrous scrap requirements

​ 

we shipped the following from our metals recycling operations

 ​ 

we sell various grades of processed ferrous scrap primarily to steel mills and foundries ferrous scrap metal is the primary raw material for electric arc furnaces such as our steel mills in addition we sell various grades of nonferrous metals such as copper brass aluminum and stainless steel to aluminum steel and ingot manufacturers brass and bronze ingot makers copper refineries and mills smelters specialty mills alloy manufacturers and other consumers

we purchase processed and unprocessed ferrous and nonferrous scrap metals in a variety of forms for our metals recycling facilities

ferrous scrap comes from two primary sources

 

nonferrous scrap comes from three primary sources

 

we do not purchase a significant amount of scrap metal from a single source or from a limited number of major sources market demand and the composition quality size weight and location of the materials are the primary factors that determine prices

products our metals recycling operations primarily involve the purchase processing and resale of ferrous and nonferrous scrap metals into reusable forms and grades we process an array of ferrous products through a variety of methods including sorting shredding shearing cutting torching baling briquetting and breaking our major ferrous products include heavy melting steel busheling bundled scrap shredded scrap and other scrap metal products such as steel turnings and cast iron these products vary in properties or attributes related to cleanness size of individual pieces and residual alloys the necessary characteristics of the ferrous products are determined by the specific needs and requirements of the consumer and affect the individual product’s relative value we process numerous grades of nonferrous products including aluminum brass copper stainless steel and other nonferrous metals additionally we provide transportation logistics truck rail and river barge marketing brokerage and scrap management services providing competitive price and cost advantages to our suppliers and customers

customers we sell various grades of processed ferrous scrap to endusers such as electric arc furnace steel mills integrated steelmakers foundries secondary smelters and metal brokers who aggregate materials for other large users ferrous scrap metal is the primary raw material for electric arc furnaces such as our steel mills most of our ferrous scrap customers purchase processed scrap through negotiated spot sales contracts which establish a quantity purchase for the month the price we charge for ferrous scrap depends upon market demand and pricing transportation costs as well as the quality and grade of the scrap we sell various grades of processed nonferrous scrap to endusers such as aluminum sheet and ingot manufacturers brass and bronze ingot makers copper refineries mills smelters specialty steelmakers alloy manufacturers wire and cable producers utilities and telephone networks the 

price we charge for nonferrous scrap also depends upon market demand and pricing transportation costs as well as the quality and grade of the scrap

competition scrap is a global commodity influenced by conditions in a number of industrialized and emerging markets throughout asia europe and north america the markets for scrap metals are highly competitive both in the purchase of raw or unprocessed scrap and the sale of processed scrap with regard to the purchase of unprocessed scrap we compete with numerous independent recyclers as well as smaller scrap companies engaged only in collecting obsolete scrap in many cases we also purchase unprocessed scrap metal from smaller scrap dealers and other processors successful procurement of materials is determined primarily by the price offered by the purchaser for the raw scrap and the proximity of our processing facility to the source of the raw scrap both ferrous and nonferrous scrap sells as a commodity in both domestic and international markets which are affected sometimes significantly by relative economic conditions currency fluctuations and the availability and cost of transportation competition for sales of processed scrap is based primarily on the price quality and location of the scrap metals as well as the level of service provided in terms of reliability and timing of delivery

we also face potential competition for sales of processed scrap from other producers of steel products such as electric arc furnace and integrated steel mills some of which like us are also vertically integrated in the scrap metals recycling business in addition other steel mills may compete with us in attempting to secure scrap supply through direct purchasing from our scrap suppliers scrap metal processors also face competition from substitutes for prepared ferrous scrap such as pig iron pelletized iron hbi direct reduced iron dri and other forms of processed iron the availability and relative prices of substitutes for ferrous scrap could result in a decreased demand for processed ferrous scrap and could result in lower prices andor lower demand for our scrap products

the industry is highly fragmented with many smaller regional national and global companies which have multiple locations in areas in which omnisource also operates no single scrap metals recycler has a significant market share in the domestic market

​ 



​ 

our steel fabrication operations include seven new millennium building systems plants that primarily serve the nonresidential construction industry throughout the united states we have a national operating footprint that allows us to serve the entire domestic construction market as well as national accounts such as large retail chains

steel fabrication operations accounted for 9 8 and 9 of our consolidated net sales during 2019 2018 and 2017 respectively we sold 644000 642000 and 627000 tons of joist and deck products during 2019 2018 and 2017 respectively our steel operations supply a substantial portion approximately 67 58 and 51 in 2019 2018 and 2017 respectively of the steel utilized in our steel fabrication operations providing strategic pullthrough demand

products our steel fabrication operations produce steel building components including steel joists girders and trusses at six locations and steel deck at five locations our joist products include bowstring arched scissor doublepitched and singlepitched joists our deck products include a full range of steel decking roof form composite floor specialty architectural floor systems and bridge deck

customers and markets  our primary steel fabrication operations customers are nonresidential steel fabricators such as metal building companies general construction contractors developers brokers and governmental entities our customers are located throughout the united states including national accounts the steel joist and deck market in the united states was approximately 21 million tons in 2019 and 2018 and 20 million tons in 2017 based on trade association estimates based on this information our steel fabrication operations continue to maintain approximately onethird of the total steel joist and deck market we believe we are well positioned with our national footprint as the nonresidential construction market continues to expand and we have available capacity that can be deployed as needed

competition we compete with other north american joist and steel deck producers primarily on the basis of price quality customer service and proximity to the customer our national footprint allows us to service the entire domestic nonresidential construction market as well as national accounts such as large retail chains and certain specialty deck customers

sources availability and cost of steel and other operations’ raw materials

scrap metals the principal raw material of our steel operations is scrap metal derived from among other sources “home scrap” generated internally at steel mills themselves industrial scrap generated as a byproduct of manufacturing and obsolete scrap recycled from endoflife automobiles appliances railroad cars and railroad track materials agricultural machinery and demolition scrap from obsolete structures containers and machines

ferrous scrap typically comprises more than 80 of the metallic melt mix in electric arc furnace steelmaking in contrast to integrated mill steelmaking where the proportion of scrap has traditionally been approximately 25 to 35 depending upon the scrap substitute material that may be available from time to time and the relative cost of such material the percentage of scrap used in our steelmaking operations could be increased or reduced in our metallic melt mix

many variables can impact ferrous scrap prices all of which reflect the pushes and pulls of the supply demand equation these factors include the level of domestic steel production high quality lowresidual scrap is a byproduct of steel manufacturing activity the level of exports of scrap from the united states and the amount of obsolete scrap production in addition domestic ferrous scrap prices generally have a strong correlation and spread to global pig iron pricing generally as domestic steel demand increases so does scrap demand and resulting scrap prices the reverse is also normally but not always true with scrap prices following steel prices downward when supply exceeds demand when scrap prices greatly accelerate this can challenge one of the principal elements of an electric arc furnace based steel mill’s traditional lower cost structure—the cost of its metallic raw material 

the following table provides pricing per gross ton from american metal market amm and ryan’s notes pig iron estimates for ferrous materials used in steel production

​ 

​ 

iron units in addition to scrap pig iron dri hbi and iron nuggets are used in our electric arc furnace steel mill production during 2019 2018 and 2017 we consumed 106 million 109 million and 103 million tons respectively of metallic materials in our steelmaking furnaces of which iron units other than scrap represented approximately 13 14 and 13 of the tons respectively of these iron substitute units consumed our idi operation supplies 100 of its production to the butler flat roll division mill representing 63 64 and 72 of their iron units in 2019 2018 and 2017 respectively

energy resources

electricity electricity is a significant input required in the electric arc furnaces in our steelmaking operations representing between 4 and 6 of steel production costs of goods sold in 2019 2018 and 2017 we have entered into fixed price electricity contracts for the butler flat roll division columbus flat roll division roanoke bar division and steel of west virginia while our engineered bar products division has a combination of fixed pricing and market pricing for the various components of the electrical services demand charge energy charge riders etc our structural and rail division purchases electricity at current market prices and through fixed price forward contracts

patents and trademarks

we currently do not own any material patents or patent applications for technologies that are in use in our production processes we have the following major registered trademarks as follows

 

research and development

our research and development activities have consisted of efforts to expand develop and improve our steel products and operating processes and our efforts to develop and improve alternative ironmaking technologies through idi most of these research and development efforts have been conducted inhouse by our employees

environmental matters

our operations are subject to substantial and evolving local state and federal environmental health and safety laws and regulations concerning among other things emissions to the air discharges to surface and ground water and to sewer systems and the generation handling storage transportation treatment and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes and secondary materials our operations are dependent upon permits regulating discharges into the environment or the use and handling of byproducts in order to operate our facilities we dedicate considerable resources aimed at achieving compliance with federal state and local laws concerning the environment while we do not currently believe that our future compliance efforts with such provisions will have a material adverse effect on our results of operations cash flows or financial condition this is subject to change in the everevolving regulatory environment in which we operate

since the interpretation and enforcement of environmental laws and regulations that may be enacted from time to time are subject to changing social or political pressures our environmental capital expenditures and costs for environmental compliance may increase in the future in addition due to the possibility of unanticipated regulatory or other developments the amount and timing of future environmental expenditures may vary substantially from those currently anticipated the cost of current and future environmental compliance may also place united states steel producers at a competitive disadvantage with respect to foreign steel producers which may not be required to undertake equivalent costs in their operations

pursuant to the resource conservation and recovery act or rcra which governs the treatment handling and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes the united states environmental protection agency or united states epa and authorized state or local environmental agencies may conduct inspections to identify alleged violations or areas where there may have been releases of solid or hazardous constituents into the environment and require the facilities to take corrective action to address any such releases rcra also allows citizens to bring certain suits against regulated facilities for potential damages and cleanup our steelmaking and certain 

other facilities generate wastes subject to rcra our operations produce various byproducts some of which for example electric arc furnace or eaf dust are often categorized as hazardous waste requiring special handling for disposal or for the recovery of metallics we collect such byproducts in pollution control equipment such as baghouses and either recycle or appropriately dispose of the unusable byproducts while we cannot predict the future actions of the regulators or other interested parties the potential exists for required corrective action at these facilities the costs of which could be substantial

under the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act known as “cercla” or “superfund” the united states epa state agencies and in some instances private parties have the authority to impose joint and several liability for the remediation of contaminated properties upon generators of waste current and former site owners and operators transporters and other potentially responsible parties regardless of fault or the legality of the original disposal activity many states have statutes and regulatory authorities similar to cercla that can also apply we have a number of material handling agreements with various contractors to properly dispose of or recycle our eaf dust and certain other byproducts of our operations however we cannot assure that even if there has been no fault by us we may not still be cited as a waste generator by reason of an environmental cleanup at a site to which our byproducts were transported

the clean water act and similar state and local laws apply to aspects of our operations and impose regulatory restrictions related to the discharge of wastewater storm water and dredged or fill material the united states epa state agencies and in certain instances private parties have the ability to bring suit alleging violations and seeking penalties and damages the clean water act’s provisions can require new or expanded water treatment investments to be made and can limit or even prohibit certain current or planned activities at our operations

the clean air act and analogous state and local laws require many of our facilities to obtain and maintain air permits in order to operate air permits can impose new or expanded obligations to limit or prevent current or future emissions and to add costly pollution control equipment enforcement for alleged violations can be brought by the united states epa state agencies and in certain instances private parties and can result in substantial penalties and injunctive relief

in addition there are a number of other environmental health and safety laws and regulations that apply to our facilities and may affect our operations by way of example and not of limitation certain portions of the federal toxic substances control act oil pollution act safe drinking water act and emergency planning and community righttoknow act as well as state and local laws and regulations implemented by the regulatory agencies apply to aspects of our facilities’ operations in some instances we may also be subject to foreign governments’ regulations and international treaties and laws many of these laws allow both the governments and citizens to bring certain suits against regulated facilities for alleged environmental violations finally our operations could be subject to certain toxic tort suits brought by citizens or other third parties alleging causes of action such as nuisance negligence trespass infliction of emotional distress or other claims alleging personal injury or property damage

employees

our work force consisted of approximately 8385 full time employees at december 31 2019 of which approximately 9 were represented by collective bargaining agreements

 item 1a risk factors 

many factors could have an effect on our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows we are subject to various risks resulting from changing economic environmental political industry business and financial conditions the factors described below represent our principal risks 

risks related to our industry 

global steelmaking overcapacity and imports of steel into the united states have adversely affected and may continue to adversely affect united states steel prices which may adversely affect our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

global steelmaking capacity currently exceeds global consumption of steel products which adversely affects united states and global steel prices such excess capacity sometimes results in steel manufacturers in certain countries exporting steel and steel products including prefabricated long product steel at prices that are lower than prevailing domestic prices and sometimes at or below their cost of production excessive imports of steel and steel products including prefabricated steel into the united states have exerted and may continue to exert downward pressure on united states steel and steel products prices which adversely affects our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows furthermore anticipated additional domestic steel capacity could increase this global overcapacity this in turn may also adversely impact domestic demand for ferrous scrap and our ferrous metallics margins united states steel producers compete with many foreign producers including those in china vietnam and other asian and european countries competition from foreign producers is typically strong and is periodically exacerbated by weakening of the economies of certain foreign steelmaking countries additionally low iron ore prices resulting in disruption of the scrap price correlation to iron ore leads to reduced global costs to produce steel further depressing steel import prices a higher volume of steel imports into the united states tends to occur at depressed prices when steel producing countries experience periods of economic difficulty decreased demand for steel products or excess capacity the global steelmaking overcapacity is exacerbated by chinese steel production capacity that far exceeds that country’s demand and has made china a major global exporter of steel resulting in weakened global steel pricing than otherwise would be expected while tariffs pursuant to section 232 of the trade expansion act of 1962 as amended “section 232” other measures to curb unfair trade such as duties or quotas and the renegotiation of trade agreements with other countries including the recently signed united statesmexicocanada agreement “usmca” have decreased the volume of steel and steel products imports in the united states domestic steel and steel products prices remain negatively impacted by excessive imports of steel and steel products into the united states should the section 232 tariffs duties or quotas expire or be relaxed repealed or circumvented by importers of steel and steel products or should trade agreements be renegotiated downward pressure may be exerted on united states steel and steel products prices which adversely affects our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows

in addition we believe the downward pressure on and periodically depressed levels of united states steel prices in recent years have been further accentuated through imports of steel involving dumping and subsidy abuses by foreign steel producers some foreign steel producers are owned controlled or subsidized by foreign governments as a result decisions by these producers with respect to their production sales and pricing are sometimes influenced to a greater degree by political and economic policy considerations than by prevailing market conditions realities of the marketplace or consideration of profit or loss however while some tariffs duties and quotas including those imposed under section 232 have been put into effect for steel and certain steel products imported from a number of countries that have been found to have been unfairly pricing steel imports to the united states some foreign steel subject to these duties tariffs and quotas circumvent the penalties by processing in or transporting through a foreign country not subject to the penalties additionally there is no assurance that the section 232 tariffs or other already imposed tariffs duties and quotas will remain in place or that new ones even if justified will be levied and even when imposed many of these are only shortlived if such tariffs duties or quotas expire or if others are further relaxed or repealed or if relatively higher united states steel prices make it attractive for foreign steelmakers to export their steel products to the united states despite the presence of tariffs duties or quotas the resurgence of substantial imports of foreign steel could create downward pressure on united states steel prices

our industry as well as the industries of many of our customers and suppliers upon whom we are dependent is affected by domestic and global economic factors including periods of slower than anticipated economic growth and the risk of a new recession 

our financial results are substantially dependent not only upon overall economic conditions in the united states and globally including north america europe and in asia but also as they may affect one or more of the industries upon which we depend for the sale of our products global or domestic actions or conditions including political actions trade policies or restrictions such as the recently signed usmca changes in tax laws terrorism natural disasters or widespread illness or other health issues such as the recent coronavirus outbreak could result in changing economic conditions in the united states and globally disruptions to or 

slowdowns in our business or our global or domestic industry or those of our customers or suppliers upon whom we are dependent or changes in our pretax and posttax financial performance additionally periods of slower than anticipated economic growth could reduce customer confidence and adversely affect demand for our products and further adversely affect our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows metals industries have historically been vulnerable to significant declines in consumption and product pricing during periods of economic downturn or continued uncertainty including the pace of domestic nonresidential construction activity

our business is also dependent upon certain industries such as construction automotive manufacturing transportation heavy and agriculture equipment and pipe and tube including octg markets and these industries are also cyclical in nature therefore these industries may experience their own fluctuations in demand for our products based on such things as economic conditions raw material and energy costs consumer demand and infrastructure funding decisions by governments many of these factors are beyond our control as a result of volatility in our industry or in the industries we serve we may have difficulty increasing or maintaining our level of sales or profitability if our industry or the industries we serve were to suffer a downturn then we may experience an adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows

a prospective decline in consumer and business confidence and spending which is often coupled with reductions in the availability of credit or increased cost of credit as well as volatility in the capital and credit markets could adversely affect the business and economic environment in which we operate and the profitability of our business we are also exposed to risks associated with the creditworthiness of our suppliers and customers if the availability of credit to fund or support the continuation and expansion of our customers’ business operations is curtailed or if the cost of that credit is increased the resulting inability of our customers or of their customers to either access credit or absorb the increased cost of that credit could adversely affect our business by reducing our sales or by increasing our exposure to losses from uncollectible customer accounts a disruption of the credit markets could also result in financial instability of some of our suppliers and customers the consequences of such adverse effects could include the interruption of production at the facilities of our customers the reduction delay or cancellation of customer orders delays or interruptions of the supply of raw materials we purchase and bankruptcy of customers suppliers or other creditors any of these events may adversely affect our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows

our level of production and our sales and earnings are subject to significant fluctuations as a result of the cyclical nature of the steel industry and some of the industries we serve 

the steel manufacturing business is cyclical in nature and the selling price of the steel we make may fluctuate significantly due to many factors beyond our control furthermore a number of our products are commodities subject to their own cyclical fluctuations in supply and demand in both metal consuming and metal generating industries including the construction and manufacturing industries the timing magnitude and duration of these cycles and the resulting price fluctuations are difficult to predict the sale of our manufactured steel products is directly affected by demand for our products in other cyclical industries such as construction automotive manufacturing transportation heavy and agriculture equipment and pipe and tube including octg markets economic difficulties stagnant or slow global economies supplydemand imbalances and currency fluctuations in the united states or globally could decrease the demand for our products or increase the amount of imports of steel into the united states which could decrease our sales margins and profitability

the scrap metal recycling industry has historically been and is expected to remain highly cyclical and this could have a material adverse effect on our metals recycling operations’ results 

scrap metal prices remain subject to fluctuation and operating results within the metals recycling industry in general have historically been and are expected to remain highly cyclical in nature similarly but not necessarily paralleling the price fluctuations in the steel business the purchase prices for automobile bodies and various other grades of obsolete and industrial scrap as well as the selling prices for processed and recycled scrap metals we utilize in our own manufacturing process or which we resell to others through our metals recycling operations are also volatile during periods of excess domestic supply or increased imports scrap metal prices may become or remain depressed and adversely affect the sales profitability and margins of our scrap business as a metals recycler we may attempt to respond to changing recycled metal selling prices by adjusting the scrap metal purchase prices we pay to others but our ability to do this may be limited by competitive or other factors during periods of low scrap prices when inbound scrap flow may slow considerably as scrap generators hold on to their scrap in hopes of getting higher prices later as such a prolonged period of low scrap prices could reduce our ability to obtain process and sell recycled materials and this could adversely affect our metals recycling operations’ results conversely periodic increased foreign demand for scrap can result in an outflow of available domestic scrap as well as resulting higher scrap prices domestically that cannot always be passed on to domestic scrap consumers thereby further reducing available domestic scrap flows and scrap margins all of which could adversely affect our sales and profitability of our metals recycling operations additionally during periods of high demand and resulting higher scrap prices ferrous scrap consumers may seek and develop ferrous scrap alternatives including pig iron and dri the availability and pricing of these 

scrap alternatives in the domestic market may have a longerterm impact on scrap pricing particularly in prime grades which could adversely affect our sales profitability and margins

volatility and major fluctuations in prices and availability of scrap metal scrap substitutes and supplies and our potential inability to pass higher costs on to our customers may constrain operating levels and reduce profit margins 

steel producers require large amounts of raw materials including scrap metal and scrap substitute products such as pig iron pelletized iron and other supplies such as zinc graphite electrodes and ferroalloys our principal raw material is scrap metal derived primarily from industrial scrap and endoflife automobiles appliances railroad cars railroad track materials agricultural machinery and demolition scrap from obsolete structures containers and machines the prices for scrap are subject to market forces largely beyond our control including demand by united states and international steel producers freight costs and speculation the prices for scrap have varied significantly in the past may vary significantly in the future and do not necessarily fluctuate in tandem with the price of steel moreover some of our integrated steel producer competitors are not as dependent as we are on scrap as a part of their raw material melt mix which during periods of high scrap costs relative to the cost of blast furnace iron used by the integrated producers give them a raw material cost advantage over minimills while our vertical integration into the metals recycling business through our omnisource operations and into the ironmaking business through our idi facility are expected to enable us to continue being a costeffective supplier to our own steelmaking operations for some of our metallics requirements we will still need to rely on other metallics and raw material suppliers as well as upon general industry supply conditions for the balance of our needs

purchase prices for auto bodies scrap metal and scrap substitute products such as pig iron that we consume and selling prices for scrap and recycled metals that we sell to third parties are volatile and beyond our control while omnisource attempts to respond to changing recycled metal selling prices through adjustments to its metal purchase prices its ability to do so is limited by competitive and other market factors changing prices could potentially impact the volume of scrap metal available to us and the volume and realized margins of processed metals we sell

the availability and prices of raw materials may also be negatively affected by new or existing laws and regulations allocation by suppliers interruptions in production accidents or natural disasters changes in exchange rates global price fluctuations the availability and cost of transportation and competing uses for raw materials as a major producer of galvanized steel products we purchase and consume a large amount of zinc which if purchased at high prices may have an effect on our profit margins due to its use in other industries demand for the primary raw material needle coke used in the production of graphite electrodes a critical raw material in our steelmaking has expanded in recent years leading to increased price any inability to secure a consistent cost effective and timely supply of our raw materials and supplies could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows

if prices for ferrous metallics increase by a greater margin than corresponding price increases for the sale of our steel products we may not be able to recoup such cost increases from increases in the selling prices of steel products conversely depressed prices for ferrous scrap may constrain its supply which may adversely affect our metals recycling operations and also the availability of certain grades of scrap for our steelmaking operations additionally our inability to pass on all or any substantial part of any cost increases during periods of rapidly rising scrap prices through scrap or other surcharges or to provide for our customers’ needs because of the potential unavailability of key raw materials or other inputs may result in production slowdowns or curtailments or may otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows

the cost and availability of electricity natural gas oil and other energy resources are subject to volatile market conditions 

steel producers like us consume large amounts of energy to melt ferrous scrap in electric arc furnaces and reheat steel for rolling into finished products we rely on third parties for the supply of energy resources we consume in our steelmaking activities the prices for and availability of electricity natural gas oil and other energy resources are subject to volatile market conditions often affected by weather conditions as well as political environmental and economic factors beyond our control as consumers of electricity and natural gas we must have dependable delivery in order to operate accordingly we are at risk in the event of an energy disruption including power outages or power unavailability prolonged blackouts or brownouts or disruptions caused by natural disasters or by political or environmental considerations would substantially disrupt our production since a significant portion of our finished steel products are delivered by truck unforeseen fluctuations in the price of fuel would also have a negative impact on our costs or on the costs of many of our customers in addition changes in certain environmental regulations including those that may impose output limitations or higher costs associated with climate change or greenhouse gas emissions could substantially increase the cost of manufacturing and raw materials to us and other steel producers

fluctuations in the value of the united states dollar relative to other currencies may adversely affect our business 

fluctuations in the value of the dollar can be expected to affect our business a strong united states dollar makes imported products less expensive potentially resulting in more imports of steel products into the united states by our foreign competitors while a weak united states dollar may have the opposite impact on imports

compliance with and changes in environmental and remediation requirements could result in substantially increased capital requirements and operating costs 

existing laws or regulations as currently interpreted or as may be interpreted in the future as well as future laws or regulations may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition

we are subject to numerous local state federal and international statutory and regulatory environmental requirements relating to among other things

 

compliance with environmental laws and regulations which affect our steelmaking metals recycling ironmaking and copper and aluminum production operations is a significant factor in our business we are required to obtain and comply with environmental permits and licenses and failure to obtain or renew or the violation of any permit or license could result in substantial fines and penalties capital expenditures operational changes suspension of operations andor the closure of a subject facility similarly delays increased costs andor the imposition of onerous conditions to the securing or renewal of permits could have a material adverse effect on these operations

uncertainty regarding adequate pollution control levels testing and sampling procedures and new pollution control technology are factors that may increase our future compliance expenditures we are unable to predict the ultimate cost of future compliance with environmental requirements or their effect on our operations although we work hard to be in substantial compliance with all applicable laws and regulations legal requirements frequently change and are subject to interpretation such that regulatory agencies may bring enforcement actions for alleged noncompliance private parties might also bring claims against us under citizen suit provisions andor for property damage or personal injury allegedly resulting from our operations new laws regulations and changing interpretations by regulatory authorities together with uncertainty regarding the application of existing requirements are among the factors that may increase our future expenditures to comply with environmental requirements the cost of complying with existing laws or regulations as currently interpreted or reinterpreted in the future or with future laws or regulations may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition

our operations produce significant amounts of byproducts some of which are handled as solid or hazardous waste or as hazardous secondary materials for example our steel mills generate electric arc furnace eaf dust which the united states environmental protection agency united states epa and other regulatory authorities classify as hazardous waste and regulate accordingly unless recycled in an exempt manner

in addition the primary feed materials for the shredders operated by our metals recycling operations are automobile bodies a portion of the feed materials consist of unrecyclable material known as shredder residue if laws or regulations or the interpretation of the laws or regulations change with regard to eaf dust or shredder residue or other byproducts created by our operations we may incur significant additional expenditures

federal and state environmental laws enable the united states epa state agencies and certain private parties to recover from owners operators generators and transporters the cost of investigation and cleanup of sites at which wastes or hazardous substances 

were disposed in connection with these laws we may be required to clean up contamination discovered at our sites including contamination that may have been caused by former owners or operators of the sites to conduct additional cleanup at sites that have already had some cleanup performed andor to perform cleanup with regard to sites formerly used in connection with our operations

in addition we may be required to pay for or to pay a portion of the costs of cleanup at sites to which we sent materials for disposal or recycling notwithstanding that the original disposal or recycling activity may have complied with all regulatory requirements then in effect under certain laws a party can be held jointly and severally liable for all of the cleanup costs associated with a disposal site in practice a liable party often splits the costs of cleanup with other potentially responsible parties we have received notices from the united states epa state agencies and third parties that we have been identified as potentially responsible for the costs of investigating and cleaning up a number of disposal sites in most cases many other parties are also named as potentially responsible parties and also contribute to payment of those costs

because cleanup liability can in some cases be imposed retroactively on activities that occurred many years ago and because the united states epa and state agencies are still discovering sites that pose a threat to public health or the environment we can provide no assurance that we will not become liable for significant costs associated with investigation and remediation of cleanup sites

increased regulation associated with climate change and greenhouse gas ghg emissions could impose significant costs on both our steelmaking and metals recycling operations 

the united states government or various other governmental agencies may introduce regulatory changes in response to the potential impacts of climate change international treaties or agreements may also result in increasing regulation of ghg emissions including the introduction of carbon emissions limitations or trading mechanisms any such regulation regarding climate change and ghg emissions could impose significant costs on our operations and on the operations of our customers and suppliers including increased energy capital equipment emissions controls environmental monitoring and reporting and other costs in order to comply with current or future laws or regulations concerning climate change and ghg emissions any adopted future climate change and ghg regulations could negatively impact our ability and that of our customers and suppliers to compete with companies situated in areas not subject to or not complying with such limitations

from a medium and longterm perspective we may see an increase in costs relating to our assets that emit significant amounts of ghgs as a result of these regulatory initiatives which may impact our operations directly or through our suppliers or customers until the timing scope and extent of any future regulation becomes known we cannot predict the effect on our financial condition operating performance and ability to compete

risks related to the business 

our senior unsecured credit facility contains and any future financing agreements may contain restrictive covenants that may limit our flexibility 

restrictions and covenants in our existing debt agreements including our senior unsecured credit facility and any future financing agreements may impair our ability to finance future operations or capital needs or to engage in other business activities a breach of any of the restrictions or covenants could cause a default under our senior unsecured credit facility our senior notes or our other debt a significant portion of our indebtedness may then become immediately due and payable

under our senior unsecured credit facility we are required to maintain certain financial covenants tied to our leverage and profitability our ability to meet such covenants or other restrictions can be affected by events beyond our control if a default were to occur the lenders could elect to declare all amounts then outstanding to be immediately due and payable and terminate all commitments to extend further credit

we may face significant price and other forms of competition from other steel producers scrap processors and alternative materials which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

the global markets in which steel companies and scrap processors conduct business are highly competitive and became even more so due to consolidations in the steel and scrap industries additionally in many applications steel competes with other materials such as aluminum cement composites plastics carbon fiber glass and wood increased use of alternative materials for any reason including as a response to regulations such as the corporate average fuel economy cafe requirements could decrease demand for steel or force other steel producers into new products or markets that compete more directly with us and combined with increased competition could cause us to lose market share increase expenditures or reduce pricing any one of which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows the global steel industry suffers from overcapacity and that excess capacity intensifies price competition for some of our products a decrease in the global demand 

for steel scrap due to market or other conditions including trade restrictions generally causes a decrease in the price of scrap metals a decrease in price could result in some scrap generators exiting the marketplace which could further decrease the availability of scrap a shortage in the availability of scrap could have a material adverse effect on both our steelmaking and our metals recycling operations and thus on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows

we are subject to significant risks relating to changes in commodity prices and may not be able to effectively protect against these risks 

we are exposed to commodity price risk during periods where we hold scrap metal inventory for processing or resale prices of commodities including scrap can be volatile due to numerous factors beyond our control in an increasing price environment for raw materials competitive conditions may limit our ability to pass on price increases to our consumers in a decreasing price environment for processed scrap we may not have the ability to fully recoup the cost of raw materials that we procure process and sell to our customers in addition new entrants into the market areas we serve could result in higher purchase prices for raw materials and lower margins from our scrap our sales and inventory position may be vulnerable to adverse changes in commodity prices which could materially adversely impact our operating and financial performance thus we engage in some hedging of certain commodities in futures markets

availability of an adequate source of supply is required for our metals recycling operations 

we procure our scrap inventory from numerous sources these suppliers generally are not bound by longterm contracts and generally have no obligation to sell recyclable metal to us in periods of low industry scrap prices scrap suppliers may elect to hold recyclable metal to wait for higher prices or intentionally slow their metal collection activities if a substantial number of scrap suppliers cease selling recyclable metal to us we may be unable to recycle metal at desired levels and our results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected in addition a slowdown of industrial production in the united states reduces the supply of industrial grades of metal to the metal recycling industry resulting in our having less recyclable metal available to process and sell

we are subject to cybersecurity threats and may face risks to the security of our sensitive data and information technology which may adversely affect our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

increased global cybersecurity and information technology security requirements vulnerabilities and threats and a rise in sophisticated and targeted cybercrime pose a risk to the security and functionality of our systems and information networks and to the confidentiality availability and integrity of sensitive data including intellectual property proprietary information financial information customer supplier and business partner information and personally identifiable information any of which could result in reputational harm and have materially adverse economic consequences additionally such cybersecurity vulnerabilities or attacks could result in an interruption of the functionality of our automated and electronically controlled manufacturing operating systems which if compromised could cease threaten delay or slow down our ability to melt roll or otherwise process steel or any of our other products for the duration of such interruption which could result in reputational harm have materially adverse economic consequences and may adversely affect our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows our customers suppliers and vendors may also store certain of our sensitive information on their information technology systems which if breached or attacked could likewise expose our sensitive information and result in reputational harm and have materially adverse economic consequences

although we believe we have adopted procedures and controls to adequately protect our sensitive data networks and information and operating technology and systems there can be no assurance that a system or network failure or cybersecurity breach or attack will be prevented whether due to attacks by cyber criminals or due to employee contractor or other error or malfeasance this could lead to system interruption production delays or downtimes and operational disruptions and the disclosure modification or destruction of sensitive data which could have an adverse effect on our reputation customer supplier and business partner relationships financial results and results of operations and could result in litigation or regulatory investigations actions fines or penalties as well as increased cybersecurity monitoring and protection costs including the cost of insurance additionally as cybersecurity threats continue to evolve and become more sophisticated we may need to invest additional time resources and finances to protect the security of our sensitive data systems and information networks

​ 

we may face risks associated with the implementation of our growth strategy 

our growth strategy subjects us to various risks as part of our growth strategy we may expand existing facilities enter into new product or process initiatives acquire or build additional plants acquire other businesses and assets enter into joint ventures or form strategic alliances that we believe will complement our existing business these expansions and transactions may involve some or all of the following risks

 

our new southwestsinton flat roll division is under construction in sinton texas and is planned to commence operations in mid2021 with an expected cost of approximately 19 billion the project is subject to the above risks as well as unfavorable weather conditions natural disasters delayed equipment deliveries and installations or other conditions outside our control could increase the cost or delay the commencement of operations of our new eaf steel mill additionally customer product or geographic markets we expect to serve may not be as profitable as currently expected which could have an adverse effect on our prospects business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

these expansions or transactions might be required for us to remain competitive but we may not be able to complete any such expansions or transactions on favorable terms or obtain financing if necessary future expansions and transactions may not improve our competitive position and business prospects as anticipated and if they do not our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows may be adversely affected

impairment charges could adversely affect our results of operations 

occasionally assumptions that we have made regarding products or businesses we have acquired or sought to develop about the sustainability of markets we sought to exploit or about industry conditions that underlie our decision making when we elected to capitalize a venture turn out differently than anticipated in such instances the fair value of such assets may fall below their carrying value recorded on our balance sheet

accordingly we periodically test goodwill and longlived tangible and intangible assets to determine whether their estimated fair value is in fact less than their value recorded on our balance sheet if we determine that the fair value of any of these assets from whatever cause is less than the value recorded on our balance sheet we are required to incur noncash asset impairment charges such as those recorded in past years that adversely affect our results of operations there can be no assurances that continued market dynamics or other factors may not result in future impairment charges

we are subject to litigation and legal compliance risks which could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and liquidity 

we are involved from time to time in various routine litigation matters including administrative proceedings regulatory proceedings governmental investigations environmental matters and commercial and construction contract disputes none of which at the present time are expected to have a material impact on our financial conditions results of operations or liquidity for additional information regarding legal proceedings please refer to item 3 legal proceedings 

in addition to risks associated with our environmental and other regulatory compliance our international operations are subject to complex foreign and united states laws and regulations including the foreign corrupt practices act and other antibribery laws regulations related to importexport controls the office of foreign assets control and other laws and regulations each of which may increase our cost of doing business and expose us to increased risk

unexpected equipment downtime or shutdowns could adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

interruptions in our production capabilities could adversely affect our production costs products available for sale and earnings during the affected period in addition to equipment failures our facilities are also subject to the risk of catastrophic loss due to unanticipated events such as fires explosions or violent weather conditions our manufacturing processes are dependent upon critical pieces of steelmaking equipment such as our electric arc furnaces continuous casters and rolling equipment some of which are controlled by our information technology systems as well as electrical equipment such as transformers this equipment may on occasion be out of service as a result of unanticipated failures or other events including cybersecurity breaches or attacks or system failures we have experienced plant shutdowns or periods of reduced production as a result of such equipment failures and may in the future experience plant shutdowns or periods of reduced production as a result of such equipment failures or other events these disruptions could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows

we have incurred and may incur in the future costs to idle facilities idled facility carrying costs or increased costs to resume production at idled facilities 

our minnesota ironmaking operations are indefinitely idled and should we in the future resume production we would incur increased costs related to preparing for operation performing any required repairs and maintenance and training employees should economic or market conditions dictate we may in the future idle additional facilities which may require us to incur idling and carrying costs related to those facilities as well as further increased costs should production be resumed at any idled facility which could have an adverse effect on our business financial results results of operations and cash flows

governmental agencies may refuse to grant or renew some of our licenses and permits 

we must receive licenses and air water and other permits and approvals from state and local governments to conduct certain of our operations or to build expand or acquire new facilities such as our new electric arc furnace flat roll steel mill currently under construction in sinton texas governmental agencies sometimes resist the establishment of certain types of facilities in their communities including scrap metal collection and processing facilities there can be no assurance that future approvals licenses and permits will be granted or that we will be able to maintain and renew the approvals licenses and permits we currently hold failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows

2019 overview

our 2019 consolidated results were challenged by high customer steel inventories as many customers purchased beyond normal demand levels in late 2018 underlying domestic steel demand remained steady in 2019 but as customers began to destock 

inventories steel prices declined throughout the year in conjunction with weakening scrap prices before firming in the fourth quarter as destocking subsided and inventory levels were rightsized declining ferrous scrap prices throughout much of 2019 negatively impacted our metals recycling operations financial results the nonresidential construction market remained strong resulting in record steel fabrication shipments with increased selling prices and margins compared to 2018 in spite of the market challenges faced by our steel and metals recycling operations our consolidated net sales of 105 billion and cash flows from operations of 14 billion were the secondbest performance in company history and our consolidated operating income was our thirdbest in company history in addition our steel fabrication operations segment achieved record shipments of 644000 tons resulting in record operating income of 1191 million

consolidated operating income for 2019 decreased 7355 million or 43 to 9869 million compared to the record 17 billion in 2018 net income attributable to steel dynamics inc for 2019 decreased 5873 million or 47 to 6711 million compared to record 2018 diluted earnings per share attributable to steel dynamics inc was 304 for 2019 compared to 535 for 2018

segment results 2019 vs 2018

overall domestic steel demand remained steady during 2019 with continued strength in the automotive construction and other industrial sectors however a challenging steel pricing environment continued throughout 2019 due to customer inventory destocking in conjunction with weakening scrap prices which led to decreasing steel selling prices compared to 2018 steel operations segment shipments decreased 2 in 2019 as compared to 2018 net sales for the steel operations decreased 11 in 2019 

when compared to 2018 due primarily to decreases in overall steel selling prices particularly in sheet steel and decreased steel mill shipments

​ 

ferrous raw materials used in our electric arc furnaces represent our single most significant steel manufacturing cost generally comprising approximately 55 to 60 percent of our steel mill operations’ manufacturing costs our metallic raw material cost per net ton consumed in our steel operations decreased 48 or 14 in 2019 compared to 2018 consistent with overall decreased domestic scrap pricing

​ 

as a result of average selling prices decreasing more than scrap costs metal spread which we define as the difference between average steel mill selling prices and the cost of ferrous scrap consumed in our steel mills decreased 10 in 2019 compared to the recordhigh 2018 due to this metal spread contraction most notably in sheet steel operating income for the steel operations decreased 44 to 10 billion in 2019 compared to the record results in 2018

​ 



​ 

metals recycling operations consists solely of omnisource and includes both ferrous and nonferrous scrap metal processing transportation marketing and brokerage services strategically located primarily in close proximity to our steel mills and other enduser scrap consumers throughout the eastern half of the united states in addition omnisource designs installs and manages customized scrap management programs for industrial manufacturing companies at hundreds of locations throughout north america our steel mills utilize a large portion approximately 65 of the ferrous scrap sold by omnisource as raw material in our steelmaking operations and the remainder is sold to other consumers such as other steel manufacturers and foundries metals recycling operations accounted for 11 and 13 of our consolidated net sales during 2019 and 2018 respectively

metals recycling operations shipments

 ​ 

segment results 2019 vs 2018

our metals recycling operations were negatively impacted throughout 2019 by falling ferrous and nonferrous scrap prices compared to 2018 as well as a challenging steel market in which customers were also reluctant to purchase during a falling pricing environment net sales for our metals recycling operations decreased 22 in 2019 as compared to 2018 driven by decreased shipments and ferrous scrap prices declining in eight of the twelve months during the year ferrous and nonferrous scrap average selling prices decreased 21 and 10 respectively during 2019 compared to 2018 ferrous metal spread which we define as the difference between average selling prices and the cost of purchased scrap decreased 15 while nonferrous metal spread decreased 7 in 2019 compared to 2018 metals recycling operations operating income in 2019 of 163 million decreased 79 from 2018 operating income of 759 million due to lower ferrous and nonferrous shipments and metal spread contraction

​ 

 ​ 

steel fabrication operations include our new millennium building systems joist and deck plants located throughout the united states and in northern mexico revenues from these plants are generated from the fabrication of steel joists trusses girders and steel deck used within the nonresidential construction industry steel fabrication operations accounted for 9 and 8 of our consolidated net sales during 2019 and 2018 respectively

​ 

​ 

​ 

​ 

segment results 2019 vs 2018

net sales for the steel fabrication operations increased 413 million or 4 during 2019 compared to 2018 as shipments increased to a record 644000 tons while average selling prices increased 58 per ton or 4 our steel fabrication operations continue to leverage our national operating footprint market demand orders and backlog continue to be strong for nonresidential construction project development as customer sentiment remains positive

the purchase of various steel products is the largest single cost of production for our steel fabrication operations generally representing approximately twothirds of the total cost of manufacturing the average cost of steel consumed decreased by 7 in 2019 as compared to 2018 consistent with decreased steel selling prices discussed in the steel operations results while average selling prices increased 4 with resulting metal spread which we define as the difference between average selling prices and the cost of purchased steel increasing 22 operating income increased 572 million or 92 to 1191 million in 2019 compared to 2018 due to the increases in volumes and metal spread with selling prices outpacing steel input costs

selling general and administrative expenses selling general and administrative expenses increased 5 or 199 million to 4365 million during 2019 compared to 2018 representing 42 and 35 of net sales respectively profit sharing expense was 780 million in 2019 a decrease of 780 million from the record 1560 million earned during 2018 the companywide profit sharing plan represents 8 of pretax earnings therefore our lower 2019 earnings resulted in lower profit sharing

interest expense net of capitalized interest during 2019 interest expense of 1271 million was comparable to the 1266 million incurred during 2018 based on consistent debt levels during the majority of both years

income tax expense during 2019 income tax expense of 1974 million representing an effective income tax rate of 226 was down 46 from the 3640 million representing an effective income tax rate of 225 during 2018 consistent with lower pretax earnings

included in the balance of unrecognized tax benefits of 102 million at december 31 2019 were potential benefits of 60 million that if recognized would affect our effective tax rate we recognize interest and penalties related to our tax contingencies on a netoftax basis in income tax expense during the year ended december 31 2019 we recognized a benefit from the decrease of interest expense of 400000 net of tax in addition to the unrecognized tax benefits noted above we had 14 million accrued for the payment of interest and penalties at december 31 2019

we file income tax returns in the united states federal jurisdiction as well as income tax returns in various state jurisdictions we have concluded us federal income tax audits through 2015 we are subject to examination and proposed adjustments by the irs for years 2016 through 2018 and tax years 2015 through 2018 remain open to various state and local jurisdictions at this time we do not believe there will be any significant examination adjustments that would result in a material change to our financial position results of operations or cash flows it is reasonably possible that the amount of unrecognized tax benefits could change in the next twelve months in an amount ranging from zero to 33 million as a result of the expiration of the statute of limitations and other federal and state income tax audits

liquidity and capital resources

capital resources and longterm debt our business is capital intensive and requires substantial expenditures for among other things the purchase and maintenance of equipment used in our steel metals recycling and steel fabrication operations and to remain in compliance with environmental laws our shortterm and longterm liquidity needs arise primarily from working capital requirements capital expenditures principal and interest payments related to our outstanding indebtedness dividends to our shareholders stock repurchases and acquisitions we have met these liquidity requirements primarily with cash provided by operations and longterm borrowings and we also have availability under our unsecured revolver our liquidity at december 31 2019 is as follows in thousands

 ​ 

in october 2019 our corporate credit rating was upgraded to an investment grade credit designation by three credit rating agencies

in december 2019 we entered into a new unsecured credit agreement which has a senior unsecured revolving credit facility facility which provides a 12 billion unsecured revolver and matures in december 2024 subject to certain conditions we have the opportunity to increase the facility size by 5000 million the unsecured revolver is available to fund working capital capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes the facility contains financial covenants and other covenants pertaining to our ability to incur indebtedness and permit liens on property our ability to borrow funds within the terms of the unsecured revolver is dependent upon our continued compliance with the financial and other covenants at december 31 2019 we had 12 billion of availability on the revolver 420 million of outstanding letters of credit and other obligations which reduce availability and there were no borrowings outstanding

the financial covenants under our facility state that we must maintain an interest coverage ratio of not less than 250100 our interest coverage ratio is calculated by dividing our lasttwelvemonths ltm consolidated adjusted ebitda earnings before interest taxes depreciation amortization and certain other noncash transactions as allowed in the facility by our ltm gross interest expense less amortization of financing fees in addition a debt to capitalization ratio of not more than 060100 must be maintained at december 31 2019 our interest coverage ratio and debt to capitalization ratio were 1072100 and 040100 respectively we were therefore in compliance with these covenants at december 31 2019 and we anticipate we will continue to be in compliance during the next twelve months

​ 

in december 2019 we issued 4000 million of 2800 senior notes due 2024 the 2024 notes and 6000 million of 3450 senior notes due 2030 the “2030 notes” the net proceeds of which were used to fund the call and redemption of all 7000 million of our 5125 senior notes due 2021 the 2021 notes in accordance with the indenture governing our 2021 notes and for general corporate purposes refer to note 3 longterm debt to the consolidated financial statements elsewhere in this report for additional information regarding these transactions and our longterm debt

our total outstanding debt increased 3576 million during 2019 due to our december 2019 issuance of the 2024 notes and 2030 notes as described above our total longterm debt to capitalization ratio representing our longterm debt including current maturities divided by the sum of our longterm debt redeemable noncontrolling interests and our total stockholders’ equity was 402 and 379 at december 31 2019 and december 31 2018 respectively

working capital we generated cash flow from operations of 14 billion in 2019 operational working capital representing amounts invested in trade receivables and inventories less current liabilities other than income taxes payable and debt decreased 3395 million excluding the effect of acquired uss working capital to 16 billion at december 31 2019 due primarily to decreased accounts receivable and inventories consistent with decreased sales and inventory costs

capital investments during 2019 we invested 4519 million in property plant and equipment primarily within our steel operations segment compared with 2394 million invested during 2018 the increase in 2019 relates primarily to organic steel growth opportunities including our new electric arc furnace flat roll steel mill currently under construction in sinton texas

cash dividends as a reflection of continued confidence in our current and future cash flow generation ability and financial position we increased our quarterly cash dividend by 28 to 02400 per share in the first quarter 2019 from 01875 per share in 2018 resulting in declared cash dividends of 2095 million during 2019 compared to 1744 million during 2018 we paid cash dividends of 2003 million and 1689 million during 2019 and 2018 respectively our board of directors along with executive management approves the payment of dividends on a quarterly basis the determination to pay cash dividends in the future is at the discretion of our board of directors after taking into account various factors including our financial condition results of operations outstanding indebtedness current and anticipated cash needs and growth plans

other in august 2018 our board of directors authorized a share repurchase program of up to 750 million of our common stock under the share repurchase program purchases will take place as and when we determine in open market or private transactions made based upon the market price of our common stock the nature of other investment opportunities or growth projects our cash flows from operations and general economic conditions the share repurchase program does not require us to acquire any specific number of shares and may be modified suspended extended or terminated by us at any time we acquired 113 million shares of our common stock for 3486 million in 2019 leaving 505 million remaining available to purchase under the program at december 31 2019 see part ii item 5 market for registrant’s common equity related stockholder matters and issuer purchases of equity securities for additional information

our ability to meet our debt service obligations and reduce our total debt will depend upon our future performance which in turn will depend upon general economic financial and business conditions along with competition legislation and regulatory factors that are largely beyond our control in addition we cannot assure that our operating results cash flows access to credit markets and capital resources will be sufficient for repayment of our indebtedness in the future we believe that based upon current levels of operations and anticipated growth cash flows from operations together with other available sources of funds including if necessary borrowings under our revolver through its term will be adequate for the next twelve months for making required payments of principal and interest on our indebtedness funding working capital requirements and anticipated capital expenditures

​ 

contractual obligations and other longterm liabilities

we have the following minimum commitments under contractual obligations including purchase obligations as defined by the securities and exchange commission a “purchase obligation” is defined as an agreement to purchase goods or services that is enforceable and legally binding and that specifies all significant terms including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased fixed minimum or variable price provisions and the approximate timing of the transaction other longterm liabilities are defined as longterm liabilities that are reflected on our balance sheet under generally accepted accounting principles based on this definition the following table includes only those contracts which include fixed or minimum obligations it does not include normal purchases which are made in the ordinary course of business the following table provides aggregated information about outstanding contractual obligations and other longterm liabilities as of december 31 2019 in thousands

​ 

 

 

other matters

inflation

we believe that inflation has not had a material effect on our results of operations

environmental and other contingencies

we have incurred and in the future will continue to incur capital expenditures and operating expenses for matters relating to environmental control remediation monitoring and compliance during 2019 we incurred costs related to the monitoring and compliance of environmental matters in the amount of approximately 321 million and capital expenditures related to environmental compliance of approximately 23 million of the costs incurred during 2019 for monitoring and compliance approximately 68 were related to the normal transportation of certain types of waste produced in our steelmaking processes and other facilities in accordance with legal requirements we incurred combined environmental remediation costs of approximately 13 million at all of our facilities during 2019 we have an accrual of 36 million recorded for environmental remediation related to our metals recycling operations and 26 million related to our minnesota ironmaking operations we believe apart from our dependence on environmental construction and operating permits for our existing and any future manufacturing facilities that compliance with current environmental laws and regulations is not likely to have a materially adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or liquidity however environmental laws and regulations evolve and change and we may become subject to more stringent environmental laws and regulations in the future such as the impact of united states government or various governmental agencies introducing regulatory changes in response to the potential of climate change

critical accounting policies and estimates

management’s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states we review the accounting policies we use in reporting our financial results on a regular basis the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent liabilities we evaluate the appropriateness of these estimations and judgments on an ongoing basis we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources results may differ from these estimates due to actual outcomes being different from those on which we based our assumptions we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements

revenue recognition and allowance for doubtful accounts except for our steel fabrication operations we recognize revenues at the point in time the performance obligation is satisfied and control of the product is transferred to the customer upon shipment or delivery at the amount of consideration the company expects to receive including any variable consideration the variable consideration included in the company’s steel operations segment contracts which is not constrained include estimated product returns and customer claims and may include volume rebates which are recorded on an expected value basis our steel fabrication operations segment recognizes revenue over time at the amount of consideration the company expects to receive revenue is measured on an output method representing completed fabricated tons to date as a percentage of total tons required for each contract the company does not exercise significant judgements in determining the timing of satisfaction of performance obligations or the transaction price provision is made for estimated product returns and customer claims based on historical experience if the historical data used in our estimates does not reflect future returns and claims trends additional provision may be necessary the allowance for doubtful accounts is based on our best estimate of known credit risks historical experience and current economic conditions affecting our customers which estimates may or may not prove accurate

we are exposed to credit risk in the event of nonpayment by our customers which in steel operations are principally intermediate steel processors and service centers that sell our products to numerous industry sectors including the construction automotive manufacturing transportation heavy and agriculture equipment and pipe and tube including octg markets our metals recycling operations sell ferrous scrap to steel mills and foundries and nonferrous scrap such as copper brass aluminum and stainless steel to among others ingot manufacturers copper refineries and mills smelters and specialty mills our steel fabrication operations sell fabricated steel joists and deck primarily to the nonresidential construction market we mitigate our exposure to credit risk which we generally extend initially on an unsecured basis by performing ongoing credit evaluations and taking further action when necessary such as requiring letters of credit or other security interests to support the customer receivable if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate resulting in the impairment of their ability to make payments additional allowance may be required

inventories we record inventories at lower of cost or net realizable value cost is determined using a weighted average cost method for raw materials and supplies and on a firstin firstout basis for other inventory we record amounts required if any to reduce the carrying value of inventory to its net realizable value as a charge to cost of goods sold if product selling prices were to decline in future periods further writedown of inventory could result specifically raw material inventory such as scrap purchased during periods of peak market pricing

impairments of longlived tangible and definitelived intangible assets we review longlived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of such assets may not be fully recoverable impairment losses are recorded on longlived assets used in operations when indicators of impairment are present and the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than the assets’ carrying amounts the impairment loss is measured by comparing the fair value of the asset to its carrying amount we consider various factors and determine whether an impairment test is necessary including by way of examples a significant and prolonged deterioration in operating results andor projected cash flows significant changes in the extent or manner in which an asset is used technological advances with respect to assets which would potentially render them obsolete our strategy and capital planning and the economic climate in markets to be served when determining future cash flows and if necessary fair value we must make judgments as to the expected utilization of assets and estimated future cash flows related to those assets we consider historical and anticipated future results general economic and market conditions the impact of planned business and operational strategies and all other available information at the time the estimates are made those estimates and judgments may or may not ultimately prove accurate

a longlived asset is classified as held for sale upon meeting specified criteria related to ability and intent to sell an asset classified as held for sale is measured at the lower of its carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell as of december 31 2019 and 2018 the company reported 80 million and 83 million respectively of assets held for sale within other current assets in our consolidated balance sheet an impairment loss is recognized for any initial or subsequent writedown of the asset held for sale to its fair value less cost to sell for assets determined to be classified as held for sale in the year ended december 31 2019 and 2018 the asset carrying amounts approximated their fair value less cost to sell the company determined fair value using level 3 fair value inputs as provided for under asc 820 consisting of information provided by brokers and other external sources along with management’s own assumptions

goodwill

our goodwill relating to various business combinations consisted of the following at december 31 in thousands

​ 

 ​ 

at least once annually as of october 1 or when indicators of impairment exist the company performs an impairment test for goodwill goodwill is allocated to various reporting units which are generally one level below the company’s operating segments the fair value of the reporting unit is determined by using an estimate of future cash flows utilizing a riskadjusted discount rate to calculate the net present value of future cash flows income approach and by using a market approach based upon an analysis of valuation metrics of comparable peer companies using level 3 fair value inputs as provided for under asc 820 if the fair value exceeds the carrying value of the reporting unit there is no impairment if the carrying amount exceeds the fair value we recognize an impairment loss in the amount by which the carrying value of the net assets assigned to the reporting unit exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit with the impairment loss not to exceed the amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit 

key assumptions used to determine the estimated fair value of each reporting unit under the discounted cash flows method income approach include a expected cash flows for the fiveyear period following the testing date including market share sales volumes and prices costs to produce and estimated capital needs b an estimated terminal value using a terminal year growth rate determined based on the growth prospects of the reporting unit and c a riskadjusted discount rate based on management’s best estimate of market participants’ aftertax weighted average cost of capital and market risk premiums key assumptions used to determine the estimated fair value of each reporting unit under the market approach include the expected revenues and cash flows in the next year we consider historical and anticipated future results general economic and market conditions the impact of planned business and operational strategies and all available information at the time the fair values of its reporting units are estimated those estimates and judgments may or may not ultimately prove accurate

goodwill acquired in past transactions are naturally more susceptible to impairment primarily due to the fact that they are recorded at fair value based on operating plans and economic conditions at the time of acquisition consequently if operating results andor economic conditions deteriorate after an acquisition it could result in the impairment of the acquired assets a deterioration of economic conditions may not only negatively impact the estimated operating cash flows used in our cash flow models but may also negatively impact other assumptions used in our analyses including but not limited to the estimated cost of capital andor discount rates additionally we are required to ensure that assumptions used to determine fair value in our analyses are consistent with the assumptions a hypothetical marketplace participant would use as a result the cost of capital andor discount rates used in our 

analyses may increase or decrease based on market conditions and trends regardless of whether our actual cost of capital has changed therefore we may recognize an impairment in spite of realizing actual cash flows that are approximately equal to or greater than our previously forecasted amounts

our fourth quarter 2019 2018 and 2017 annual goodwill impairment analyses did not result in any impairment charges management does not believe that it is reasonably likely that our reporting units will fail the goodwill impairment test in the near term as the determined fair value of the reporting units with goodwill exceeded their carrying value by more than an insignificant amount we will continue to monitor operating results within all reporting units throughout the upcoming year to determine if events and circumstances warrant interim impairment testing otherwise all reporting units will again be subject to the required annual impairment test during the fourth quarter of 2020 changes in judgments and estimates underlying our analysis of goodwill for possible impairment including expected future operating cash flows and discount rate could decrease the estimated fair value of our reporting units in the future and could result in an impairment of goodwill

income taxes we are required to estimate our income taxes as a part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements this requires us to estimate our actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatments of items for tax and accounting purposes these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities which are included within our consolidated balance sheet we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely we must establish a valuation allowance we also establish reserves to reduce some or all of the tax benefit of any of our tax positions at the time we determine that the positions become uncertain we adjust these reserves including any impact on the related interest and penalties in light of changing facts and circumstances such as the progress of a tax audit a number of years may elapse before a particular matter for which we have established a reserve is audited by a taxing authority and finally resolved the number of years with open tax audits varies depending on the tax jurisdiction the tax benefit that has been previously reserved because of a failure to meet the more likely than not recognition threshold would be recognized in our income tax expense in the first interim period when the uncertainty disappears settlement of any particular issue would usually require the use of cash




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk

market risk

in the normal course of business we are exposed to interest rate changes our objectives in managing fluctuations in interest rates are to limit the impact of these rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower overall borrowing costs to achieve these objectives we may use interest rate swaps to manage net exposure to interest rate changes related to our portfolio of borrowings however we have not done so during 2019 2018 or 2017

​ 

the following table represents the principal cash repayments and related weightedaverage interest rates by maturity date for our longterm debt as of december 31 2019 in thousands

 ​ 

commodity risk

in the normal course of business we are exposed to the market risk and price fluctuations related to the sale of our products and to the purchase of raw materials used in our operations such as metallic raw materials electricity natural gas and its transportation services fuel air products zinc and electrodes our risk strategy associated with product sales has generally been to obtain competitive prices for our products and to allow operating results to reflect market price movements dictated by supply and demand

our risk strategy associated with the purchase of raw materials utilized within our operations has generally been to make some commitments with suppliers relating to future expected requirements for some commodities such as electricity water natural gas and its transportation services fuel air products zinc and electrodes certain of these commitments contain provisions which require us to “take or pay” for specified quantities without regard to actual usage for periods of generally up to 5 years for physical commodity requirements and commodity transportation requirements with some extending beyond and for up to 13 years for air products our commitments for these arrangements with “take or pay” or other similar commitment provisions for the years ending december 31 are as follows in thousands

​ 

 ​ 

we utilized such “take or pay” requirements during the past three years under these contracts except for certain air products at our idle minnesota ironmaking operations we believe that production requirements will be such that consumption of the products or services purchased under these commitments will occur in the normal production process other than certain air products related to our minnesota ironmaking operations during the idle period we also purchase electricity consumed at our butler flat roll division pursuant to a contract which extends through december 2020 which establishes an agreed fixedrate energy charge per millkwh consumed for each year through the expiration of the agreement

in our metals recycling and steel operations we have certain fixed price contracts with various customers and suppliers for future delivery of nonferrous and ferrous metals our risk strategy has been to enter into base metal financial contracts with the goal to protect the profit margin within certain parameters that was contemplated when we entered into the transaction with the customer or vendor at december 31 2019 we had a cumulative unrealized loss associated with these financial contracts of 456000 substantially all of which have settlement dates in 2020 we believe the customer contracts associated with the financial contracts will be fully consummated

steel fabrication operations steel joists  girders and steel deck including specialty deck 

this diversified portfolio of products enables us to access a broad range of enduser markets serve a wide customer base and help mitigate our market exposure to any one product or enduser market resulting in increased utilization in addition our valueadded product offerings help to balance our exposure to commodity grade products supplied by other domestic steel and foreign manufacturers 

we will continue to seek additional opportunities and to collaborate with our customers to anticipate their future needs by further expanding our range of products and offerings which may allow our customers the ability to more effectively and efficiently navigate their supply chain one such opportunity is our recently completed and commissioned 8 2 million investment at our structural and rail division to utilize excess melting and casting capability to produce up to 240000 tons of various sizes of reinforcing bar including custom cuttolength smooth bar and coiled  another such opportunity is the addition of a new 140 million galvanizing line at our columbus flat roll division which will increase annual coating capability by 400000 tons with operations expected to begin midyear 2020   

strategic geographic locations  enter new geographic markets 

the majority of our steelmaking facilities are in locations near sources of scrap materials and near our customer base allowing us to realize freight savings for inbound scrap as well as for outbound steel products destined for our customers this also allows us to provide consistent ontime delivery to our customer base with relatively short lead times further solidifying our customer relationships our coated sheet steel products are also available through our locations in pittsburgh pennsylvania jeffersonville indiana and columbus mississippi due to river access recycled ferrous scrap and iron units represent the most significant component of our cost of steel manufacturing we believe that our metals recycling facilities are in the regions that account for a majority of the total ferrous scrap produced in the united states our steel fabrication operations have a national footprint allowing us to serve the entire joist and deck domestic market and national accounts 

we plan to continue to seek and enter new markets in strategic geographic locations that offer attractive growth opportunities within our areas of expertise as evidenced by our recent public announcement of the anticipated construction of a new stateoftheart electricarcfurnace flat roll steel mill  the company currently expects to locate the facility in the southwestern united states to cost effectively serve not only the southern united states but also the mexican flat roll steel market  th is facility is anticipated to have an annual production capacity of approximately 30 million tons with the capability to produce the latest generation of a dvanced h igh s trength s teel products the project will include valueadded finishing lines including a galvanizing line with an annual coating capacity of 450000 tons and a paint line with an annual coating capacity of 250000 tons  the product offering is anticipated to include various flat roll steel products including hot roll cold roll galvanized galvalume® and painted steel primarily serving the energy automotive construction and appliance sectors

﻿ 

steel operations consist of our six electric arc furnace steel mills producing steel from ferrous scrap and scrap substitutes utilizing continuous casting automated rolling mills and several downstream steel coating and bar processing lines and idi our liquid pig iron production facility that supplies solely the butler flat roll division our steel operations sell directly to endusers steel fabricators and service centers these products are used in numerous industry sectors including the construction automotive manufacturing transportation heavy and agriculture equipment and pipe and tube including octg markets our steel operations accounted for 75 of our consolidated net sales during 2018 and 72 in 2017 and 2016  we are predominantly a domestic steel company with only 5 of our revenues generated from exported sales during 2018 and 2017  and 4 in 2016  

our steel operations consist primarily of steelmaking and coating operations we have approximately 84 million tons of flat roll steel shipping capacity comprised of 64 million tons of flat roll steel production capacity at our butler and columbus flat roll divisions and an additional 20 million tons of flat roll steel processing capacity at our techs and heartland divisions we also have annual flat roll galvanizing capability of 38 million tons and painting capability of 750000 tons 

﻿ 

we have approximately 4 6 million tons of long product steel shipping capacity as follows tons in thousands 

﻿ 

﻿ 



﻿ 

steelmaking capacities represent manufacturing capabilities based on steel mill configuration and related employee support these capacities do not represent expected volumes in a given year in addition estimates of steel mill capacity are highly dependent on the specific product mix manufactured each of our steel mills can and do roll many different types and sizes of products therefore our capacity estimates assume a typical product mix 

﻿ 

 

the following chart summarizes our steel operations primary products and the estimated percentage of tons sold by end market   

 

sheet steel products 

our sheet steel products consisting of hot roll cold roll and coated steel products are produced by our butler and columbus flat roll divisions and our numerous downstream coating lines including the techs and heartland flat roll division acquired june 29 2018 our sheet steel operations represented 7 0 71 and 70 of steel operations net sales in 2018  2017  and 2016  respectively we produced 7 5 million  71 million and 69 million tons of sheet steel at these facilities in 2018 2017 and 2016 respectively  

idi produces liquid pig iron and hot briquetted iron hbi that serves as a substitute for a portion of the metallic raw material mix that goes directly into our butler flat roll division electric arc furnaces to produce steel idi’s primary focus is to maximize liquid pig iron production due to the inherent economic benefits achieved at the steel mill when the material is used in the steelmaking process such as reduced energy cost reduced materials cost and quicker melting cycles during 2018  2017  and 2016 respectively idi produced 262 000  259000 and 255000 metric tons of which 9 6   90 and 98 respectively was liquid pig iron we have used and plan to continue to use all of the facility’s output internally 

﻿ 

the following chart summarizes the types of sheet steel products sold by sales dollars during the respective years 

customers steel processors and service centers typically act as intermediaries between primary sheet steel producers and the many enduser manufacturers that require further processing of hot roll coils the additional processing performed by the intermediate steel processors and service centers include pickling galvanizing cutting to length slitting to size leveling blanking shape correcting edge rolling shearing and stamping we believe that our intermediate steel processor and service center customers will remain an integral part of our customer base the columbus flat roll division allows us to capitalize on the industrial markets in the southern united states and mexico as well as further expand our customer base in painted and line and other pipe products galvanized flat roll products produced by our butler and columbus flat roll divisions are similar and are sold to a similar customer base the techs and heartland flat roll division specialize in the galvanizing of specific types of flat roll steels in primarily nonautomotive applications servicing a variety of customers in the heating ventilation and air conditioning hvac construction agriculture and consumer goods markets our sheet steel operations also provide a substantial portion of the sheet steel utilized in our steel fabrication operations

customers the principal customers for our structural steel products are steel service centers steel fabricators and various manufacturers service centers though not the ultimate enduser provide valuable mill distribution functions to the fabricators and manufacturers including small quantity sales repackaging cutting preliminary processing and warehousing the steel rail marketplace in the united states canada and mexico is specialized and defined with eight class i railroads and a large distribution network 

sbq products are principally consumed by cold finishers forgers intermediate processors oem manufacturers steel service centers and distributors as well as pull through volume to vulcan our mbq products are sold primarily to steel service centers as well as reinforcing bar distributors joist producers and oems some of the excess steel billet production at the roanoke bar division is sold to mills without sufficient melting capacities including our steel of west virginia facility our steel fabrication operations also purchase angles from roanoke bar division steel of west virginia’s customers are primarily oems producing truck trailers industrial lift trucks merchant products guardrail posts manufactured housing mining and offhighway construction equipment steel of west virginia’s flexible manufacturing capabilities enable us to meet demand for a variety of customordered and designed products many of these products are produced in small quantities for low volume enduses resulting in a wide variety of customers the largest of which are in the truck trailer and industrial lift truck industries 

steel competition the markets in which we conduct business are highly competitive with an abundance of competition in the carbon steel industry from north american and foreign integrated and minimill steelmaking and processing operations we compete in numerous industry sections most significantly tied to the construction automotive and other manufacturing sectors in many applications within these industry sections steel competes with other materials such as aluminum cement composites plastics carbon fiber glass and wood some of our products are commodities subject to their own cyclical fluctuations in supply and demand however we are focused on providing a broader range of diversified valueadded products that deemphasize commodity steel the primary competitive influences on products we sell are price quality and valueadded services 

global steelmaking capacity exceeds global consumption of steel products such excess capacity sometimes results in steel manufacturers in certain countries exporting steel at prices that are lower than prevailing domestic prices and sometimes at or below their cost to produce excessive imports of steel into the united states in 2017 intensified price competition on the domestic steel industry which negatively affected our ability to increase our selling prices and realize higher margins and profitability while the 2018 introduction of tariffs pursuant to section 232 of the trade expansion act of 1962 as amended has decreased the volume of steel products imports in the united states domestic steel and steel products prices remain negatively impacted by excessive imports of steel and steel products into the united states

the metals recycling operations consists solely of omnisource and includes both ferrous and nonferrous scrap metal processing transportation marketing and brokerage services strategically located primarily in close proximity to our steel mills and other enduser scrap consumers throughout the eastern half of the united states in addition omnisource designs installs and manages customized scrap management programs for industrial manufacturing companies at hundreds of locations throughout north america our metals recycling operations accounted for 13 of our consolidated net sales during 2018   and 15 in   2017 and 2016 our steel mills utilize a significant portion of the ferrous scrap processed through omnisource as raw material in our steelmaking operations and the remainder is sold to other consumers this strategic symbiotic relationship with our own steelmaking operations provides valuable pullthrough demand to omnisource’s ferrous scrap operations in 2018  2017  and 2016  omnisource provided our steel operations with 39  38 and 40 respectively of its ferrous scrap requirements 

we shipped the following from our metals recycling operations 

﻿ 



﻿ 

we sell various grades of processed ferrous scrap primarily to steel mills and foundries ferrous scrap metal is the primary raw material for electric arc furnaces such as our steel mills in addition we sell various grades of nonferrous metals such as copper brass aluminum and stainless steel to aluminum steel and ingot manufacturers brass and bronze ingot makers copper refineries and mills smelters specialty mills alloy manufacturers and other consumers 

we purchase processed and unprocessed ferrous and nonferrous scrap metals in a variety of forms for our metals recycling facilities 

ferrous scrap comes from two primary sources 





nonferrous scrap comes from three primary sources 







we do not purchase a significant amount of scrap metal from a single source or from a limited number of major sources market demand and the composition quality size weight and location of the materials are the primary factors that determine prices 

products our metals recycling operations primarily involve the purchase processing and resale of ferrous and nonferrous scrap metals into reusable forms and grades we process an array of ferrous products through a variety of methods including sorting shredding shearing cutting torching baling briquetting and breaking our major ferrous products include heavy melting steel busheling bundled scrap shredded scrap and other scrap metal products such as steel turnings and cast iron these products vary in properties or attributes related to cleanness size of individual pieces and residual alloys the necessary characteristics of the ferrous products are determined by the specific needs and requirements of the consumer and affect the individual product’s relative value we process numerous grades of nonferrous products including aluminum brass copper stainless steel and other nonferrous metals additionally we provide transportation logistics truck rail and river barge marketing brokerage and scrap management services providing competitive price and cost advantages to our suppliers and customers 

customers we sell various grades of processed ferrous scrap to endusers such as electric arc furnace steel mills integrated steelmakers foundries secondary smelters and metal brokers who aggregate materials for other large users ferrous scrap metal is the primary raw material for electric arc furnaces such as our steel mills most of our ferrous scrap customers purchase processed scrap through negotiated spot sales contracts which establish a quantity purchase for the month the price we charge for ferrous scrap depends upon market demand and pricing transportation costs as well as the quality and grade of the scrap we sell various grades of processed nonferrous scrap to endusers such as aluminum sheet and ingot manufacturers brass and bronze ingot makers copper refineries mills smelters specialty steelmakers alloy manufacturers wire and cable 

 

producers utilities and telephone networks the price we charge for nonferrous scrap also depends upon market demand and pricing transportation costs as well as the quality and grade of the scrap 

competition scrap is a global commodity influenced by conditions in a number of industrialized and emerging markets throughout asia europe and north america the markets for scrap metals are highly competitive both in the purchase of raw or unprocessed scrap and the sale of processed scrap with regard to the purchase of unprocessed scrap we compete with numerous independent recyclers as well as smaller scrap companies engaged only in collecting obsolete scrap in many cases we also purchase unprocessed scrap metal from smaller scrap dealers and other processors successful procurement of materials is determined primarily by the price offered by the purchaser for the raw scrap and the proximity of our processing facility to the source of the raw scrap both ferrous and nonferrous scrap sells as a commodity in both domestic and international markets which are affected sometimes significantly by relative economic conditions currency fluctuations and the availability and cost of transportation competition for sales of processed scrap is based primarily on the price quality and location of the scrap metals as well as the level of service provided in terms of reliability and timing of delivery 

we also face potential competition for sales of processed scrap from other producers of steel products such as electric arc furnace and integrated steel mills some of which like us are also vertically integrated in the scrap metals recycling business in addition other steel mills may compete with us in attempting to secure scrap supply through direct purchasing from our scrap suppliers scrap metal processors also face competition from substitutes for prepared ferrous scrap such as prereduced iron pellets hbi pig iron direct reduced iron dri and other forms of processed iron the availability and relative prices of substitutes for ferrous scrap could result in a decreased demand for processed ferrous scrap and could result in lower prices andor lower demand for our scrap products 

the industry is highly fragmented with many smaller regional national and global companies which have multiple locations in areas in which omnisource also operates no single scrap metals recycler has a significant market share in the domestic market

our steel fabrication operations include seven new millennium building systems plants that primarily serve the nonresidential construction industry throughout the united states we have a national operating footprint that allows us to serve the entire domestic construction market as well as national accounts such as large retail chains 

steel fabrication operations accounted for 8 of our consolidated net sales during 2018  and 9  in   2017 and 2016  we sold 642 000 627000 and 563000 tons of joist and deck products during 2018 2017 and 2016 respectively  our steel operations supply a substantial portion approximately 58   51 and 59  in 2018 2017 and 2016 respectively of the steel utilized in our steel fabrication operations providing strategic pullthrough demand 

products our steel fabrication operations produce steel building components including steel joists girders trusses six locations and steel deck five locations our joist products include bowstring arched scissor double ‑pitched and single ‑pitched joists our deck products include a full range of steel decking roof form composite floor specialty architectural floor systems and bridge deck 

customers and markets  our primary steel fabrication operations customers are nonresidential steel fabricators such as metal building companies general construction contractors developers brokers and governmental entities our customers are located throughout the united states including national accounts the steel joist and deck market in the united states was approximately 21 million  20 million tons and 19 million tons in 2018 2017 and 2016 respectively  based on trade association estimates based on this information our steel fabrication operations continue to maintain approximately one third of the total steel joist and deck market  we believe we are well positioned with our national footprint as the nonresidential construction market continues to expand and we have available capacity that can be deployed as needed 

competition we compete with other north american joist and steel deck producers primarily on the basis of price quality customer service and proximity to the customer our national footprint allows us to service the entire domestic nonresidential construction market as well as national accounts such as large retail chains and certain specialty deck customers

sources availability and cost of steel and other operations’ raw materials 

scrap metals the principal raw material of our steel operations is scrap metal derived from among other sources “home scrap” generated internally at steel mills themselves industrial scrap generated as a byproduct of manufacturing and obsolete scrap recycled from endoflife automobiles appliances railroad cars and railroad track materials agricultural machinery and demolition scrap from obsolete structures containers and machines 

ferrous scrap typically comprises more than 80 of the metallic melt mix in electric arc furnace steelmaking in contrast to integrated mill steelmaking where the proportion of scrap has traditionally been approximately 25 to 35 de pending upon the scrap substitute material that may be available from time to time and the relative cost of such material the percentage of scrap used in our steelmaking operations could be increased or reduced in our metallic melt mix 

many variables can impact ferrous scrap prices all of which reflect the pushes and pulls of the supply demand equation these factors include the level of domestic steel production high quality lowresidual scrap is a byproduct of steel manufacturing activity the level of exports of scrap from the united states and the amount of obsolete scrap production in addition domestic ferrous scrap prices generally have a strong correlation and spread to global pig iron pricing generally as domestic steel demand increases so does scrap demand and resulting scrap prices the reverse is also normally but not always true with scrap prices following steel prices downward when supply exceeds demand excess sheet steel imports declined during 2016 with duties levied pursuant to the trade case rulings from the united states international trade commission resulting in increased domestic steel mill utilization resulting in improved scrap pricing steel imports rose during 2017 mostly related to structural and prefabricated structural long products but also cold roll and coated sheet steel maintaining pressure on steel selling prices in those markets however scrap prices continued to climb in 2017 due to strong domestic steel mill utilization and level scrap exports this trend continued in 2018 with stronger domestic steel mill utilization and demand when scrap prices greatly accelerate this can challenge one of the principal elements of an electric arc furnace based steel mill’s traditional lower cost structure—the cost of its metallic raw material 

the following table provides pricing per gross ton from american metal market amm and ryan’s notes pig iron estimates for ferrous material s used in steel production 

﻿ 

 

iron units in addition to scrap dri hbi pig iron and iron nuggets are used in our electric arc furnace steel mill production during 2018  2017  and 2016  we consumed 10 9 million 103 million and 99 million tons respectively of metallic materials in our steelmaking furnaces of which iron units other than scrap represented approximately 1 4  13 and 14 of the tons respectively of these iron substitute units consumed our idi operation supplies 100 of its production to the butler flat roll division mill representing 64  72 and 65 of their iron units in 2018   2017  and 2016  respectively 

energy resources 

electricity   electricity is a significant input required in the electric arc furnaces in our steelmaking operations representing between 5  and 7 of steel production costs of goods sold in 2018  2017 and 2016  we have entered into fixed price electricity contracts for the butler flat roll division columbus flat roll division roanoke bar division and steel of west virginia while our engineered bar products division has a combination of fixed pricing and market pricing for the various components of the electrical services demand charge energy charge riders etc our structural and rail division purchases electricity at current market prices and through fixed price forward contracts 

patents and trademarks 

we currently do not own any material patents or patent applications for technologies that are in use in our production processes we have the following major registered trademarks as follows 















research and development 

our research and development activities have consisted of efforts to expand develop and improve our products and operating processes and our efforts to develop and improve alternative ironmaking technologies through idi most of these research and development efforts have been conducted inhouse by our employees 

environmental matters 

our operations are subject to substantial and evolving local state and federal environmental health and safety laws and regulations concerning among other things emissions to the air discharges to surface and ground water and to sewer systems and the generation handling storage transportation treatment and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes and secondary materials our operations are dependent upon permits regulating discharges into the environment or the use and handling of byproducts in order to operate our facilities we dedicate considerable resources aimed at achieving compliance with federal state and local laws concerning the environment while we do not currently believe that our future compliance efforts with such provisions will have a material adverse effect on our results of operations cash flows or financial condition this is subject to change in the everevolving regulatory environment in which we operate 

since the interpretation and enforcement of environmental laws and regulations that may be enacted from time to time are subject to changing social or political pressures our environmental capital expenditures and costs for environmental compliance may increase in the future in addition due to the possibility of unanticipated regulatory or other developments the amount and timing of future environmental expenditures may vary substantially from those currently anticipated the cost of current and future environmental compliance may also place united states steel producers at a competitive disadvantage with respect to foreign steel producers which may not be required to undertake equivalent costs in their operations 

pursuant to the resource conservation and recovery act or rcra which governs the treatment handling and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes the united states environmental protection agency or united states epa and authorized state or local environmental agencies may conduct inspections to identify alleged violations or areas where there may have been releases of solid or hazardous constituents into the environment and require the facilities to take corrective action to address any such releases rcra also allows citizens to bring certain suits against regulated facilities for potential damages and cleanup our steelmaking and certain other facilities generate wastes subject to rcra our operations produce various byproducts some of which for example electric arc furnace or eaf dust are often categorized as hazardous waste requiring special handling for disposal or for the recovery of metallics we collect such byproducts in pollution control equipment such as baghouses and either recycle or appropriately dispose of these byproducts while we cannot predict the future actions of the regulators or other interested parties the potential exists for required corrective action at these facilities the costs of which could be substantial 

 

under the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act known as “cercla” or “superfund” the united states epa state agencies and in some instances private parties have the authority to impose joint and several liability for the remediation of contaminated properties upon generators of waste current and former site owners and operators transporters and other potentially responsible parties regardless of fault or the legality of the original disposal activity many states have statutes and regulatory authorities similar to cercla that can also apply we have a number of material handling agreements with various contractors to properly dispose of or recycle our eaf dust and certain other byproducts of our operations however we cannot assure that even if there has been no fault by us we may not still be cited as a waste generator by reason of an environmental cleanup at a site to which our byproducts were transported 

the clean water act and similar state and local laws apply to aspects of our operations and impose regulatory restrictions related to the discharge of wastewater storm water and dredged or fill material the united states epa state agencies and in certain instances private parties have the ability to bring suit alleging violations and seeking penalties and damages the clean water act’s provisions can require new or expanded water treatment investments to be made and can limit or even prohibit certain current or planned activities at our operations 

the clean air act and analogous state and local laws require many of our facilities to obtain and maintain air permits in order to operate air permits can impose new or expanded obligations to limit or prevent current or future emissions and to add costly pollution control equipment enforcement for alleged violations can be brought by the united states epa state agencies and in certain instances private parties and can result in substantial penalties and injunctive relief 

in addition there are a number of other environmental health and safety laws and regulations that apply to our facilities and may affect our operations by way of example and not of limitation certain portions of the federal toxic substances control act oil pollution act safe drinking water act and emergency planning and community righttoknow act as well as state and local laws and regulations implemented by the regulatory agencies apply to aspects of our facilities’ operations in some instances we may also be subject to foreign governments’ regulations and international treaties and laws many of these laws allow both the governments and citizens to bring certain suits against regulated facilities for alleged environmental violations finally our operations could be subject to certain toxic tort suits brought by citizens or other third parties alleging causes of action such as nuisance negligence trespass infliction of emotional distress or other claims alleging personal injury or property damage  

employees 

our work force consisted of approximately 8200 full time employees at december 31 2018  of which approximately 9  were represented by collective bargaining agreements

risks related to our industry 

global steelmaking overcapacity and imports of steel into the united states have adversely affected and may continue to adversely affect united states steel prices which may adversely affect our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

global steelmaking capacity currently exceeds global consumption of steel products which adversely affects united states and global steel prices such excess capacity sometimes results in steel manufacturers in certain countries exporting steel and steel products including prefabricated longproduct steel at prices that are lower than prevailing domestic prices and sometimes at or below their cost of production excessive imports of steel and steel products including prefabricated steel into the united states such as in recent years have exerted and may continue to exert downward pressure on united states steel and steel products prices which adversely affects our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows furthermore anticipated additional domestic steel capacity could increase this global overcapacity this in turn may also adversely impact domestic demand for ferrous scrap and our ferrous metallics margins united states steel producers compete with many foreign producers including those in china vietnam and other asian and european countries competition from foreign producers is typically strong and is periodically exacerbated by weakening of the economies of certain foreign steelmaking countries additionally low iron ore prices resulting in disruption of the scrap price correlation to iron ore leads to reduced global costs to produce steel further depressing steel import prices a higher volume of steel exports to the united states tend to occur at depressed prices when steel producing countries experience periods of economic difficulty decreased demand for steel products or excess capacity the global steelmaking overcapacity is exacerbated by chinese steel production capacity that far exceeds that country’s demand and has made china a major global exporter of steel resulting in weakened global steel pricing than otherwise would be expected while the introduction of tariffs pursuant to section 232 of the trade expansion act of 1962 as amended “section 232” has decreased the volume of steel and steel products imports in the united states domestic steel and steel products prices remain negatively impacted by excessive imports of steel and steel products into the united states should the section 232 tariffs expire or be relaxed or repealed or should it be circumvented by importers of steel and steel products downward pressure may be exerted on united states steel and steel products prices which adversely affects our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

in addition we believe the downward pressure on and periodically depressed levels of united states steel prices in recent years have been further accentuated through imports of steel involving dumping and subsidy abuses by foreign steel producers some foreign steel producers are owned controlled or subsidized by foreign governments as a result decisions by these producers with respect to their production sales and pricing are sometimes influenced to a greater degree by political and economic policy considerations than by prevailing market conditions realities of the marketplace or consideration of profit or loss however while some tariffs duties and quotas including those imposed under section 232 have been put into effect for steel and certain steel products imported from a number of countries that have been found to have been unfairly pricing steel imports to the united states some foreign steel subject to these duties tariffs and quotas circumvent the penalties by processing in or transporting through a foreign country not subject to the penalties additionally there is no assurance that the section 232 tariffs or other already imposed tariffs duties and quotas will remain in place or that new ones even if justified will be levied and even when imposed many of these are only shortlived if such tariffs duties or quotas expire or if others are further relaxed or repealed or if relatively higher united states steel prices make it attractive for foreign steelmakers to export their steel products to the united states despite the presence of tariffs duties or quotas the resurgence of substantial imports of foreign steel could create downward pressure on united states steel prices 

our industry as well as the industries of many of our customers and suppliers upon whom we are dependent is affected by domestic and global economic factors including periods of slower than anticipated economic growth and the risk of a new recession 

our financial results are substantially dependent not only upon overall economic conditions in the united states and globally including europe and in asia but also as they may affect one or more of the industries upon which we depend for the sale of our products global or domestic actions including political actions trade policies or restrictions such as the replacement of the north american free trade agreement with the united statesmexicocanada agreement and the changed provisions thereunder or changes in tax laws could result in changing economic conditions in the united states and globally or changes in our pretax and posttax financial performance additionally periods of slower than anticipated economic growth could reduce customer confidence and adversely affect demand for our products and further adversely affect our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows metals industries have historically been vulnerable to significant declines in consumption and product pricing during periods of economic downturn or continued uncertainty including the pace of domestic nonresidential construction activity 

our business is also dependent upon certain industries such as construction automotive manufacturing transportation heavy and agriculture equipment and pipe and tube including octg markets and these industries are also cyclical in nature therefore these industries may experience their own fluctuations in demand for our products based on such things as economic conditions raw material and energy costs consumer demand and infrastructure funding decisions by governments many of these factors are beyond our control as a result of volatility in our industry or in the industries we serve we may have difficulty increasing or maintaining our level of sales or profitability if our industry or the industries we serve were to suffer a downturn then we may experience an adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

 

a prospective decline in consumer and business confidence and spending which is often coupled with reductions in the availability of credit or increased cost of credit as well as volatility in the capital and credit markets could adversely affect the business and economic environment in which we operate and the profitability of our business we are also exposed to risks associated with the creditworthiness of our suppliers and customers if the availability of credit to fund or support the continuation and expansion of our customers’ business operations is curtailed or if the cost of that credit is increased the resulting inability of our customers or of their customers to either access credit or absorb the increased cost of that credit could adversely affect our business by reducing our sales or by increasing our exposure to losses from uncollectible customer accounts a disruption of the credit markets could also result in financial instability of some of our suppliers and customers the consequences of such adverse effects could include the interruption of production at the facilities of our customers the reduction delay or cancellation of customer orders delays or interruptions of the supply of raw materials we purchase and bankruptcy of customers suppliers or other creditors any of these events may adversely affect our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

our level of production and our sales and earnings are subject to significant fluctuations as a result of the cyclical nature of the steel industry and some of the industries we serve 

the steel manufacturing business is cyclical in nature and the selling price of the steel we make may fluctuate significantly due to many factors beyond our control furthermore a number of our products are commodities subject to their own cyclical fluctuations in supply and demand in both metal consuming and metal generating industries including the construction and manufacturing industries the timing magnitude and duration of these cycles and the resulting price fluctuations are difficult to predict the sale of our manufactured steel products is directly affected by demand for our products in other cyclical industries such as construction automotive manufacturing transportation heavy and agriculture equipment and pipe and tube including octg markets economic difficulties stagnant or slow global economies supplydemand imbalances and currency fluctuations in the united states or globally could decrease the demand for our products or increase the amount of imports of steel into the united states which could decrease our sales margins and profitability 

the scrap metal recycling industry has historically been and is expected to remain highly cyclical and this could have a material adverse effect on our metals recycling operations’ results 

scrap metal prices remain subject to fluctuation and operating results within the metals recycling industry in general have historically been and are expected to remain highly cyclical in nature similarly but not necessarily paralleling the price fluctuations in the steel business the purchase prices for automobile bodies and various other grades of obsolete and industrial scrap as well as the selling prices for processed and recycled scrap metals we utilize in our own manufacturing process or which we resell to others through our metals recycling operations are also volatile during periods of excess domestic supply or increased imports scrap metal prices may become or remain depressed and adversely affect the sales profitability and margins of our scrap business as a metals recycler we may attempt to respond to changing recycled metal selling prices by adjusting the scrap metal purchase prices we pay to others but our ability to do this may be limited by competitive or other factors during periods of low scrap prices when inbound scrap flow may slow considerably as scrap generators hold on to their scrap in hopes of getting higher prices later as such a prolonged period of low scrap prices could reduce our ability to obtain process and sell recycled materials and this could adversely affect our metals recycling operations’ results conversely periodic increased foreign demand for scrap can result in an outflow of available domestic scrap as well as resulting higher scrap prices domestically that cannot always be passed on to domestic scrap consumers thereby further reducing available domestic scrap flows and scrap margins all of which could adversely affect our sales and profitability of our metals recycling operations additionally during periods of high demand and resulting higher scrap prices ferrous scrap consumers may seek and develop ferrous scrap alternatives including pig iron and dri the availability and pricing of these scrap alternatives in the domestic market may have a longerterm impact on scrap pricing particularly in prime grades which could adversely affect our sales profitability and margins 

volatility and major fluctuations in scrap metal pig iron zinc and graphite electrode prices and availability and our potential inability to pass higher costs on to our customers may constrain operating levels and reduce profit margins 

steel producers require large amounts of raw materials including scrap metal and scrap substitute products such as pig iron pelletized iron and other supplies such as zinc graphite electrodes and ferroalloys our principal raw material is scrap metal derived primarily from industrial scrap and endoflife automobiles appliances railroad cars railroad track materials agricultural machinery and demolition scrap from obsolete structures containers and machines the prices for scrap are subject to market forces largely beyond our control including demand by united states and international steel producers freight costs and speculation the prices for scrap have varied significantly in the past may vary significantly in the future and do not necessarily fluctuate in tandem with the price of steel moreover some of our integrated steel producer competitors are not as dependent as we are on scrap as a part of their raw material melt mix which during periods of high scrap costs relative to the cost of blast furnace iron used by the integrated producers give them a raw material cost advantage over minimills while our vertical integration into the metals recycling business through our omnisource operations and into the ironmaking business through our idi facility are expected to enable us to continue being a costeffective supplier to our own steelmaking operations for some of our metallics requirements we will still need to rely on other metallics and raw material suppliers as well as upon general industry supply conditions for the balance of our needs 

purchase prices for auto bodies scrap metal and scrap substitute products such as pig iron that we consume and selling prices for scrap and recycled metals that we sell to third parties are volatile and beyond our control while omnisource attempts to respond to changing recycled metal selling prices through adjustments to its metal purchase prices its ability to do so is limited by competitive and other market factors changing prices could potentially impact the volume of scrap metal available to us and the volume and realized margins of processed metals we sell 

 

the availability and prices of raw materials may also be negatively affected by new or existing laws and regulations allocation by suppliers interruptions in production accidents or natural disasters changes in exchange rates global price fluctuations the availability and cost of transportation and competing uses for raw materials as a major producer of galvanized steel products we purchase and consume a large amount of zinc which is currently at historically high prices and may have an effect on our profit margins due to its use in other industries demand for the primary raw material needle coke used in the production of graphite electrodes has expanded in recent years leading to increased price and possible difficulty in securing and timely obtaining graphite electrodes graphite electrodes are a critical raw material in our steelmaking any inability to secure a consistent and timely supply of our raw materials and supplies including graphite electrodes could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations or prospects 

if prices for ferrous metallics increase by a greater margin than corresponding price increases for the sale of our steel products we may not be able to recoup such cost increases from increases in the selling prices of steel products conversely depressed prices for ferrous scrap may constrain its supply which may adversely affect our metals recycling operations and also the availability of certain grades of scrap for our steelmaking operations additionally our inability to pass on all or any substantial part of any cost increases during periods of rapidly rising scrap prices through scrap or other surcharges or to provide for our customers’ needs because of the potential unavailability of key raw materials or other inputs may result in production slowdowns or curtailments or may otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations or prospects 

the cost and availability of electricity and natural gas are also subject to volatile market conditions 

steel producers like us consume large amounts of energy to melt ferrous scrap in electric arc furnaces and reheat steel for rolling into finished products we rely on third parties for the supply of energy resources we consume in our steelmaking activities the prices for and availability of electricity natural gas oil and other energy resources are also subject to volatile market conditions often affected by weather conditions as well as political environmental and economic factors beyond our control as consumers of electricity and natural gas we must have dependable delivery in order to operate accordingly we are at risk in the event of an energy disruption including power outages or power unavailability prolonged blackouts or brownouts or disruptions caused by natural disasters or by political or environmental considerations would substantially disrupt our production since a significant portion of our finished steel products are delivered by truck unforeseen fluctuations in the price of fuel would also have a negative impact on our costs or on the costs of many of our customers in addition changes in certain environmental regulations including those that may impose output limitations or higher costs associated with climate change or greenhouse gas emissions could substantially increase the cost of manufacturing and raw materials to us and other steel producers 

fluctuations in the value of the united states dollar relative to other currencies may adversely affect our business 

fluctuations in the value of the dollar can be expected to affect our business a strong united states dollar such as recently experienced makes imported products less expensive potentially resulting in more imports of steel products into the united states by our foreign competitors while a weak united states dollar may have the opposite impact on imports 

compliance with and changes in environmental and remediation requirements could result in substantially increased capital requirements and operating costs 

existing laws or regulations as currently interpreted or as may be interpreted in the future as well as future laws or regulations may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

we are subject to numerous local state federal and international statutory and regulatory environmental requirements relating to among other things 

﻿ 























compliance with environmental laws and regulations which affect our steelmaking metals recycling ironmaking and copper and aluminum production operations is a significant factor in our business we are required to obtain and comply with environmental permits and licenses and failure to obtain or renew or the violation of any permit or license could result in substantial fines and penalties capital expenditures operational changes suspension of operations andor the closure of a subject facility similarly delays increased costs andor the imposition of onerous conditions to the securing or renewal of permits could have a material adverse effect on these operations 

 

uncertainty regarding adequate pollution control levels testing and sampling procedures and new pollution control technology are factors that may increase our future compliance expenditures we are unable to predict the ultimate cost of future compliance with environmental requirements or their effect on our operations although we work hard to be in substantial compliance with all applicable laws and regulations legal requirements frequently change and are subject to interpretation such that regulatory agencies may bring enforcement actions for alleged noncompliance private parties might also bring claims against us under citizen suit provisions andor for property damage or personal injury allegedly resulting from our operations new laws regulations and changing interpretations by regulatory authorities together with uncertainty regarding the application of existing requirements are among the factors that may increase our future expenditures to comply with environmental requirements the cost of complying with existing laws or regulations as currently interpreted or reinterpreted in the future or with future laws or regulations may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

our manufacturing and metals recycling operations produce significant amounts of byproducts some of which are handled as solid or hazardous waste or as hazardous secondary materials for example our steel mills generate electric arc furnace eaf dust which the united states environmental protection agency united states epa and other regulatory authorities classify as hazardous waste and regulate accordingly unless recycled in an exempt manner 

in addition the primary feed materials for the shredders operated by our metals recycling operations are automobile bodies a portion of the feed materials consist of unrecyclable material known as shredder residue if laws or regulations or the interpretation of the laws or regulations change with regard to eaf dust or shredder residue or other byproducts created by our operations we may incur significant additional expenditures 

federal and state environmental laws enable the united states epa state agencies and certain private parties to recover from owners operators generators and transporters the cost of investigation and cleanup of sites at which wastes or hazardous substances were disposed in connection with these laws we may be required to clean up contamination discovered at our sites including contamination that may have been caused by former owners or operators of the sites to conduct additional cleanup at sites that have already had some cleanup performed andor to perform cleanup with regard to sites formerly used in connection with our operations 

in addition we may be required to pay for or to pay a portion of the costs of cleanup at sites to which we sent materials for disposal or recycling notwithstanding that the original disposal or recycling activity may have complied with all regulatory requirements then in effect under certain laws a party can be held jointly and severally liable for all of the cleanup costs associated with a disposal site in practice a liable party often splits the costs of cleanup with other potentially responsible parties we have received notices from the united states epa state agencies and third parties that we have been identified as potentially responsible for the costs of investigating and cleaning up a number of disposal sites in most cases many other parties are also named as potentially responsible parties and also contribute to payment of those costs 

because cleanup liability can in some cases be imposed retroactively on activities that occurred many years ago and because the united states epa and state agencies are still discovering sites that pose a threat to public health or the environment we can provide no assurance that we will not become liable for significant costs associated with investigation and remediation of cleanup sites 

increased regulation associated with climate change and greenhouse gas ghg emissions could impose significant costs on both our steelmaking and metals recycling operations 

the united states government or various governmental agencies may introduce regulatory changes in response to the potential impacts of climate change international treaties or agreements may also result in increasing regulation of ghg emissions including the introduction of carbon emissions limitations or trading mechanisms any such regulation regarding climate change and ghg emissions could impose significant costs on our operations and on the operations of our customers and suppliers including increased energy capital equipment emissions controls environmental monitoring and reporting and other costs in order to comply with current or future laws or regulations concerning climate change and ghg emissions any adopted future climate change and ghg regulations could negatively impact our ability and that of our customers and suppliers to compete with companies situated in areas not subject to or not complying with such limitations 

from a medium and longterm perspective we are likely to see an increase in costs relating to our assets that emit significant amounts of ghgs as a result of these regulatory initiatives which may impact our operations directly or through our suppliers or customers until the timing scope and extent of any future regulation becomes known we cannot predict the effect on our financial condition operating performance and ability to compete 

risks related to the business 

our senior secured credit facility contains and any future financing agreements may contain restrictive covenants that may limit our flexibility 

restrictions and covenants in our existing debt agreements including our senior secured credit facility and any future financing agreements may impair our ability to finance future operations or capital needs or to engage in other business activities specifically these agreements may limit or restrict our ability to 









 













a breach of any of the restrictions or covenants could cause a default under our senior secured credit facility our senior notes or our other debt a significant portion of our indebtedness may then become immediately due and payable 

under our senior secured credit facility we are required to maintain certain financial covenants tied to our leverage and profitability our ability to meet such covenants or other restrictions can be affected by events beyond our control if a default were to occur the lenders could elect to declare all amounts then outstanding to be immediately due and payable and terminate all commitments to extend further credit if we are unable to repay those outstanding amounts the lenders could proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure such indebtedness we have pledged substantially all of our receivables and inventories and all shares of capital stock or other equity interests of our whollyowned subsidiaries and intercompany debt held by us as collateral for our senior secured credit facility 

we may face significant price and other forms of competition from other steel producers scrap processors and alternative materials which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operation or prospects 

the global markets in which steel companies and scrap processors conduct business are highly competitive and became even more so due to consolidations in the steel and scrap industries additionally in many applications steel competes with other materials such as aluminum cement composites plastics carbon fiber glass and wood increased use of alternative materials for any reason including as a response to regulations such as the corporate average fuel economy cafÉ requirements could decrease demand for steel or force other steel producers into new products or markets that compete more directly with us and combined with increased competition could cause us to lose market share increase expenditures or reduce pricing any one of which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations or prospects the global steel industry suffers from overcapacity and that excess capacity intensifies price competition for some of our products a decrease in the global demand for steel scrap due to market or other conditions including trade restrictions such as china’s refusal to accept steel scrap imports generally causes a decrease in the price of scrap metals a decrease in price could result in some scrap generators exiting the marketplace which could further decrease the availability of scrap a shortage in the availability of scrap could have a material adverse effect on both our steelmaking and our metals recycling operations and thus on our business financial condition results of operations or prospects 

we are subject to significant risks relating to changes in commodity prices and may not be able to effectively protect against these risks 

we are exposed to commodity price risk during periods where we hold scrap metal inventory for processing or resale prices of commodities including scrap can be volatile due to numerous factors beyond our control in an increasing price environment for raw materials competitive conditions may limit our ability to pass on price increases to our consumers in a decreasing price environment for processed scrap we may not have the ability to fully recoup the cost of raw materials that we procure process and sell to our customers in addition new entrants into the market areas we serve could result in higher purchase prices for raw materials and lower margins from our scrap our sales and inventory position may be vulnerable to adverse changes in commodity prices which could materially adversely impact our operating and financial performance thus we engage in some hedging of certain commodities in futures markets 

availability of an adequate source of supply is required for our metals recycling operations 

we procure our scrap inventory from numerous sources these suppliers generally are not bound by longterm contracts and generally have no obligation to sell recyclable metal to us in periods of low industry scrap prices scrap suppliers may elect to hold recyclable metal to wait for higher prices or intentionally slow their metal collection activities if a substantial number of scrap suppliers cease selling recyclable metal to us we may be unable to recycle metal at desired levels and our results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected in addition a slowdown of industrial production in the united states reduces the supply of industrial grades of metal to the metal recycling industry resulting in our having less recyclable metal available to process and sell 

we are subject to cybersecurity threats and may face risks to the security of our sensitive data and information technology which may adversely affect our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

increased global cybersecurity and information technology security requirements vulnerabilities and threats and a rise in sophisticated and targeted cybercrime pose a risk to the security and functionality of our systems and information networks and to the confidentiality availability and integrity of sensitive data including intellectual property proprietary information financial information customer supplier and business partner information and personally identifiable information any of which could have materially adverse economic consequences additionally such cybersecurity vulnerabilities or attacks could result in an interruption of the functionality of our automated and electronically controlled manufacturing operating systems which if compromised could cease threaten delay or slow down our ability to melt roll or otherwise process steel or any of our other products for the duration of such interruption which could have materially adverse economic consequences and which may adversely affect our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows our customers suppliers and vendors may also store certain of our sensitive information on their information technology systems which if breached or attacked could likewise expose our sensitive information and have materially adverse economic consequences 

 

although we believe we have adopted procedures and controls to adequately protect our sensitive data networks and information and operating technology and systems there can be no assurance that a system or network failure or cybersecurity breach or attack will be prevented whether due to attacks by cyber criminals or due to employee contractor or other error or malfeasance this could lead to system interruption production delays or downtimes and operational disruptions and the disclosure modification or destruction of sensitive data which could have an adverse effect on our reputation customer supplier and business partner relationships financial results and results of operations and could result in litigation or regulatory investigations actions fines or penalties as well as increased cybersecurity monitoring and protection costs additionally as cybersecurity threats continue to evolve and become more sophisticated we may need to invest additional time resources and finances to protect the security of our sensitive data systems and information networks 

we may face risks associated with the implementation of our growth strategy 

our growth strategy subjects us to various risks as part of our growth strategy we may expand existing facilities enter into new product or process initiatives acquire or build additional plants acquire other businesses and assets enter into joint ventures or form strategic alliances that we believe will complement our existing business these expansions and transactions including our recently announced planned construction of a new electricarcfurnace flat roll steel mill with an anticipated annual production capacity of approximately 30 million tons expected to be located in the southwestern united states may involve some or all of the following risks 







































these expansions or transactions might be required for us to remain competitive but we may not be able to complete any such transactions on favorable terms or obtain financing if necessary future expansions and transactions may not improve our competitive position and business prospects as anticipated and if they do not our business financial condition results of operations or prospects may be adversely affected 

impairment charges could adversely affect our results of operations 

occasionally assumptions that we have made regarding products or businesses we have acquired or sought to develop about the sustainability of markets we sought to exploit or about industry conditions that underlie our decision making when we elected to capitalize a venture turn out differently than anticipated in such instances the fair value of such assets may fall below their carrying value recorded on our balance sheet 

accordingly we periodically test goodwill and longlived tangible and intangible assets to determine whether their estimated fair value is in fact less than their value recorded on our balance sheet if we determine that the fair value of any of these assets from whatever cause is less than the value recorded on our balance sheet we are required to incur noncash asset impairment charges such as those recorded in past years that adversely affect our results of operations there can be no assurances that continued market dynamics or other factors may not result in future impairment charges 

we are subject to litigation and legal compliance risks which could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and liquidity 

we are involved from time to time in various routine litigation matters including administrative proceedings regulatory proceedings governmental investigations environmental matters and commercial and construction contract disputes none of which at the present time are expected to have a material impact on our financial conditions results of operations or liquidity for additional information regarding legal proceedings please refer to item 3 legal proceedings  

 

in addition to risks associated with our environmental and other regulatory compliance our international operations are subject to complex foreign and united states laws and regulations including the foreign corrupt practices act regulations related to importexport controls the office of foreign assets control and other laws and regulations each of which may increase our cost of doing business and expose us to increased risk 

unexpected equipment downtime or shutdowns could adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and prospects 

interruptions in our production capabilities could adversely affect our production costs products available for sale and earnings during the affected period in addition to equipment failures our facilities are also subject to the risk of catastrophic loss due to unanticipated events such as fires explosions or violent weather conditions our manufacturing processes are dependent upon critical pieces of steelmaking equipment such as our electric arc furnaces continuous casters and rolling equipment some of which are controlled by our information technology systems as well as electrical equipment such as transformers this equipment may on occasion be out of service as a result of unanticipated failures or other events including cybersecurity breaches or attacks or system failures we have experienced plant shutdowns or periods of reduced production as a result of such equipment failures and may in the future experience plant shutdowns or periods of reduced production as a result of such equipment failures or other events these disruptions could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and prospects 

we have incurred and may incur in the future costs to idle facilities idled facility carrying costs or increased costs to resume production at idled facilities 

our minnesota ironmaking operations are indefinitely idled and should we in the future resume production we would incur increased costs related to preparing for operation performing any required repairs and maintenance and training employees should economic or market conditions dictate we may in the future idle additional facilities which may require us to incur idling and carrying costs related to those facilities as well as further increased costs should production be resumed at any idled facility which could have an adverse effect on our financial results and results of operations 

governmental agencies may refuse to grant or renew some of our licenses and permits 

we must receive licenses and air water and other permits and approvals from state and local governments to conduct certain of our operations or to build expand or acquire new facilities such as our anticipated construction of a new electric arc furnace flat roll steel mill with an anticipated annual production capacity of approximately 30 million tons expected to be located in the southwestern united states governmental agencies sometimes resist the establishment of certain types of facilities in their communities including scrap metal collection and processing facilities there can be no assurance that future approvals licenses and permits will be granted or that we will be able to maintain and renew the approvals licenses and permits we currently hold failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and prospects

2017 overview 

﻿ 

our consolidated results for 2017 benefited from improved demand in the domestic steel market resulting in record steel shipments and sales compared to 2016 improved metal spreads from increased selling prices and a resulting 19 increase in operating income underlying domestic steel consumption increased in 2017 as the construction and energy markets continued to improve throughout the year the heavy and offroad equipment and general industrial manufacturing markets improved and the automotive markets remained strong however steel imports rose again in 2017 most notably in structural and fabricated structural but also in cold roll and coated sheet supported by increased domestic steel mill utilization compared to 2016 our metals recycling operations were able to maintain consistent volume and realize increased ferrous metal spreads while also further reducing operating costs resulting in improved operating income of almost 250 the nonresidential construction market continued to strengthen resulting in record steel fabrication sales and shipments however increasing selling prices were outpaced by higher steel input costs resulting in compressed metal spread 

﻿ 

our 2017 performance both operationally and financially was our second best year we achieved numerous then annual records while continuing to focus on and improve companywide safety

segment results 2018 vs 2017 

overall domestic steel demand was strong throughout 2018 based on strength in the automotive construction and energy sectors as well as generally lower finished steel imports compared to 2017 steel operations segment shipments increased 7  to a record 100 million tons in 2018 as compared to 2017 with long products in particular reporting strong gains over the prior year due to improved customer demand and less import pressure primarily on structural merchantbarquality and specialbarquality products net sales for the steel operations increased 29  in 2018 when compared to 2017 due to the increase in shipments and an increase of  158 per ton or 2 1  in average selling prices consistent with increased steel market demand and product pricing our steel mill utilization rate increased to 9 6  in 2018 as compared to 92 in 2017   our steel utilization rates continue to outpace our domestic competitors due to our diversified valueadded product offerings 

 

metallic raw materials used in our electric arc furnaces represent our single most significant steel manufacturing cost generally comprising approximately 60 of our steel operations’ manufacturing costs excluding the operations of the techs heartland and vulcan which purchase rather than produce the steel they further process our metallic raw material cost per net ton consumed in our steel operations increased  48  or 16  in 2018 compared to 2017 consistent with overall increased domestic scrap pricing 

﻿ 

as a result of selling prices increasing more than scrap costs metal spread which we define as the difference between average selling prices and the cost of ferrous scrap consumed increased 23  in 2018 compared to 2017 operating income for the steel operations increased 67  to a record  1 8 b illion in 2018 compared to 2017 due to increased shipments and metal spread expansion

steel fabrication operations include our new millennium building systems joist and deck plants located throughout the united states and in northern mexico revenues from these plants are generated from the fabrication of steel joists trusses girders and steel deck used within the nonresidential construction industry  steel fabrication operations accounted for 8  of our consolidated net sales during 2018 and 9 during 2017   and 2016  

segment results 2018 vs 2017 

net sales for our steel fabrication operations increased  975 million or 12  to a record 9220 million during 2018 compared to 2017 as shipments increased 2  to a record 642000 tons  and average selling prices increased  123 per ton or 9  our steel fabrication operations continue to lever our national operating footprint d emand and order backlogs continue to be strong as our customer base remains optimistic about nonresidential construction project development 

﻿ 

the purchase of various steel products is the largest single cost of production for our steel fabrication operations generally representing approximately twothirds of the total cost of manufacturing the average cost of steel consumed increased by 21  in 2018 as compared to 2017  consistent with increased steel selling prices discussed in the steel operations results while average selling prices increased only 9  with resulting metal spread which we define as the difference between average selling prices and the cost of purchased steel decreasing 6  on a per ton basis operating income decreased  254 million or 29  to  619 million in 2018 compared to 2017 due to the increases in steel input costs outpacing selling price and volume increases  

segment results 2017 vs 2016 

the overall nonresidential construction market continued to improve throughout 2017 demonstrating a positive growth profile as our fabrication operations achieved record shipments in 2017 net sales of 8244 million for the segment increased 1209 million or 17 in 2017 

 

compared to 2016 as volumes increased 11 and selling prices increased 5 our steel fabrication operations continued to realize strength in order activity and resulting shipments as we continued to leverage our national operating footprint to sustain and improve market share and market demand continued to improve 

﻿ 

the average cost of steel consumed increased by 15 in 2017 consistent with increased selling prices discussed in the steel operations results as compared to 2016 while average selling prices increased only 5 resulting in metal spread contracting 5 operating income decreased 4 to 873 million in 2017 compared to 2016 as increased shipments were more than offset by metal spread contraction

other operations consist of subsidiary operations that are below the quantitative thresholds required for reportable segments and primarily consist of smaller joint ventures and   minnesota ironmaking operations that have been idle since may 2015  also included in “other” are certain unallocated corporate accounts such as the company’s senior secured credit facility senior notes certain other investments and certain profit sharing expenses  

﻿ 

during the fourth quarter of 2016 impairment indicators related primarily to mining resources and mesabi mining fixed assets within our minnesota ironmaking operations resulted in a noncash asset impairment charge of 1273 million including amounts attributable to noncontrolling interests of 131 million which reduced net income attributable to steel dynamics inc by 729 million for the year ended december 31 2016 

consolidated results 2018 vs 2017 

selling general and administrative expenses   selling general and administrative expenses of  4166 million during 2018 increased 6  from  3946 million during 2017 representing 35 and 41 of net sales respectively  profit sharing expense during 2018 of  1560 million increased 71  from the  913 million during 2017 consistent with our increase d   profitability 

interest expense net of capitalized interest during 20 18 interest expense decreased 6  to  1266 million from  1344 million during 2017 due to the repayment of our 3500 million 6375 senior notes due 2022 with 4125 senior notes due 2025 in the latter half of 2017  

other expense income net net other income of 240 million in 2018 consists primarily of interest income associated with our invested cash and shortterm investments net other income of 28 million in 2017 included 146 million of offsetting costs associated with call premium and other financing costs associated with the tender and call of the senior notes due 2022 which were more than offset by other income primarily interest 

income tax expense   during 2018 our income tax expense was 3640 million at an effective income tax rate of 225 as compared to 1294 million at an effective income tax rate of 138 during 2017 the lower effective tax rate in 2017 was due to a onetime 1806 million net federal tax benefit resulting from the revaluation of deferred tax assets and liabilities in connection with the enacted tax cuts and jobs act of 2017 which reduced our 2017 effective tax rate 193  

included in the balance of unrecognized tax benefits of 101 million at december 31 2018 are potential benefits of 60 million that if recognized would affect our effective tax rate we recognize interest and penalties related to our tax contingencies on a netoftax basis in income tax expense during the year ended december 31 2018 we recognized a benefit from the de crease of interest expense of 13 million net of tax in addition to the unrecognized tax benefits noted above we had 24 million accrued for the payment of interest and penalties at december 31 2018 

we file income tax returns in the united states federal jurisdiction as well as income tax returns in various state jurisdictions we have concluded us federal income tax audits through 2015 we are subject to examination and proposed adjustments by the irs for years 2016 and 2017    and tax years 20142017 remain open to various state and local jurisdictions at this time we do not believe there will be any significant examination adjustments that would result in a material change to our financial position results of operations or cash flows it is reasonably possible that the amount of unrecognized tax benefits could change in the next twelve months in an amount ranging from zero to 53 million as a result of the expiration of the statu t e of limitations and other federal and state income tax audits  

consolidated results 2017 vs 2016 

selling general and administrative expenses selling general and administrative expenses of 3946 million during 2017 increased 6 from 3740 million during 2016 representing approximately 41 and 48 of net sales respectively  the increase in 2017 compared to 2016 is due most notably to increased performancebased incentive compensation associated with our increased profitability profit sharing of 913 million in 2017 increased 210 million or 28 over 2016 with our increased profitability 

interest expense net of capitalized interest during 2017 interest expense decreased 116 million to 1344 million when compared to 2016 the decrease in interest expense is due to lower interest rates on our senior notes outstanding in the fourth quarter of 2016 we called and repaid 4000 million of 6125 senior notes due 2019 with 5000 senior notes due 2026 also in the fourth quarter of 2016 we early paid off the remaining 2281 million of outstanding senior term loan debt in addition in the second half of 2017 we called and repaid our 3500 million of 6375 senior notes due 2022 with 4125 senior notes due 2025

income tax expense   during 2017 our income tax expense was 1294 million at an effective income tax rate of 138 as compared to income tax expense of 2041 million resulting in an effective income tax rate of 362 during 2016 the lower effective tax rate in 2017 was due primarily to a onetime 1806 million net federal tax benefit resulting from our revaluation of deferred tax assets and liabilities in connection with the enacted tax cuts and jobs act of 2017 and discrete tax benefits related to valuation allowance reductions state tax refunds and equitybased compensation 

liquidity and capital resources 

capital resources and long ‑term debt our business is capital intensive and requires substantial expenditures for among other things the purchase and maintenance of equipment used in our steel metals recycling and steel fabrication operations and to remain in compliance with environmental laws our shortterm and longterm liquidity needs arise primarily from working capital requirements capital expenditures principal and interest payments related to our outstanding indebtedness dividends to our shareholders stock repurchases and acquisitions we have met these liquidity requirements primarily with cash provided by operations and longterm borrowings and we also have availability under our revolver our liquidity at december 31  2018 is as follows in thousands 

﻿ 



﻿ 

our tot al outstanding debt decreased  52 million during 2018 due   to decreased revolving credit facility borrowings at one of our controlled subsidiaries our total longterm debt to capitalization ratio representing our longterm debt including current maturities divided by the sum of our longterm debt redeemable noncontrolling interests and our total stockholders’ equity decreased to 379 at december 31  2018 compared to 419 at december 31 2017 due to increases in total equity from earnings  net of dividends and share repurchases  

﻿ 

our senior secured credit facility facility which provides a 12 billion revolver was renewed and extended in june 2018 to extend maturity to june 2023 subject to certain conditions we have the opportunity to increase the revolver size by at least 7500 million the facility is guaranteed by certain of our subsidiaries and is secured by substantially all of our and our whollyowned subsidiaries’ receivables and inventories and by pledges of all shares of our whollyowned subsidiaries’ capital stock or other equity interests and intercompany debt held by us as collateral the revolver is available to fund working capital capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes the facility contains financial covenants and other covenants pertaining to our ability which may under certain circumstances be limited to make capital expenditures incur indebtedness permit liens on property enter into transactions with affiliates make restricted payments or investments enter into mergers acquisitions or consolidations conduct asset sales pay dividends or distributions or enter into other specified transactions and activities our ability to borrow funds within the terms of the revolver is dependent upon our continued compliance with the financial and other covenants at december 31  2018 we had 12 billion of availability on the revolver  120 million of outstanding letters of credit and other obligations which reduce availability and there were no borrowings outstanding 

﻿ 

the financial covenants under our facility state that we must maintain an interest coverage ratio of not less than 250100 our interest coverage ratio is calculated by dividing our lasttwelvemonths ltm consolidated adjusted ebitda earnings before interest taxes depreciation amortization and certain other noncash transactions as allowed in the facility by our ltm gross interest expense less amortization of financing fees in addition a net debt as defined in the facility to ltm consolidated adjusted ebitda net debt leverage ratio of not more than 500100 must be maintained if the net debt leverage ratio exceeds 350100 at any time our ability to make certain payments as defined in the facility which includes cash dividends to stockholders and share purchases among other things is limited at december 31  2018 our interest coverage ratio and ne t debt leverage ratio were 16 88 100 and 08 5 100 respectively  we were therefore in compliance with these covenants at december 31  2018 and we anticipate we will continue to be in compliance during the next twelve months  

﻿ 

working capital   we generated cash flow from operations of  14 b illion in 2018 operational working capital representing amounts invested in trade receivables and inventories less current liabilities other than income taxes payable and debt increased  2844 million excluding acquired he artland working capital to 19 billion at december 31  2018 consistent with increases in volumes selling prices inventory costs and profitability during 2018  

﻿ 

capital investments during 2018 we invested  2394 million in property plant and equipment primarily within our steel operations segment compared with  1649 million invested during 2017  the increase in 2018 relates primarily to organic steel growth opportunities 

﻿ 

cash dividends as a reflection of continued confidence in our current and future cash flow generation ability and financial position we increased our quarterly cash dividend by 21 to 01875 per share in the first quarter 2018 from 0155 per share in 2017 resulting in declared cash dividends of 1744 million during 2018 compared to 1482 million during 2017 we paid cash dividends of 1689 million and 1456 million during 2018 and 2017 respectively our board of directors along with executive management approves the payment of dividends on a quarterly basis the determination to pay cash dividends in the future is at the discretion of our board of directors after taking into account various 

 

factors including our financial condition results of operations outstanding indebtedness current and anticipated cash needs and growth plans in addition the terms of our facility and the indentures relating to our senior notes may restrict the amount of cash dividends we can pay  

﻿ 

other in 2016 the board of directors authorized a share repurchase program of up to 450 million of our common stock and in august 2018 an additional share repurchase program of up to 750 million of our common stock under the share repurchase programs purchases will take place as and when we determine in open market or private transactions made based upon the market price of our common stock the nature of other investment opportunities or growth projects our cash flows from operations and general economic conditions the share repurchase programs do not require us to acquire any specific number of shares and may be modified suspended extended or terminated by us at any time we acquired 131 million shares of our common stock for 5236 million in 2018 pursuant to these programs completing the 2016 450 million program and initiating the 2018 750 million program see part ii item 5 market for registrant’s common equity related stockholder matters and issuer purchases of equity securities for additional information 

﻿ 

our ability to meet our debt service obligations and reduce our total debt will depend upon our future performance which in turn will depend upon general economic financial and business conditions along with competition legislation and regulatory factors that are largely beyond our control in addition we cannot assure that our operating results cash flows access to credit markets and capital resources will be sufficient for repayment of our indebtedness in the future we believe that based upon current levels of operations and anticipated growth cash flows from operations together with other available sources of funds including if necessary borrowings under our revolver through its term will be adequate for the next twelve months for making required payments of principal and interest on our indebtedness funding working capital requirements and anticipated capital expenditures 

﻿ 

during 2018 we received benefits from state and local governments in the form of real estate and personal property tax abatements and credits of approximately 130 million based on our current abatements and incentive credits and utilizing our existing longlived asset structure we estimate the remaining annual benefit to our future operations to be approximately 121 million 63 million 59 million 58 million 53 million 50 million and 48 million during the years 2019 through 202 5  respectively  

contractual obligations and other longterm liabilities 

﻿ 

we have the following minimum commitments under contractual obligations including purchase obligations as defined by the securities and exchange commission a “purchase obligation” is defined as an agreement to purchase goods or services that is enforceable and legally binding and that specifies all significant terms including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased fixed minimum or variable price provisions and the approximate timing of the transaction other longterm liabilities are defined as longterm liabilities that are reflected on our balance sheet under generally accepted accounting principles based on this definition the following table includes only those contracts which include fixed or minimum obligations it does not include normal purchases which are made in the ordinary course of business the following table provides aggregated information about outstanding contractual obligations and other longterm liabilities as of december 31 2018 in thousands 

﻿ 



﻿ 

1 the longterm debt payment information presented above assumes that our senior notes remain outstanding until maturity refer to note 3 longterm debt to the consolidated financial statements elsewhere in this report for additional information regarding these transactions and our longterm debt 

2 the estimated interest payments shown above assume interest rates of 5125 on our 7000 million senior unsecured notes due october 2021 5 1  4  on our 4000 million senior unsecured notes due april 2023 5500 on our 5000 million senior unsecured notes due october 2024 4125 on our 3500 million senior unsecured notes due september 2025 500 on our 4000 million senior unsecured notes due december 2026 0225 commitment fee on our available revolver and an average of 52 on our other debt of 514 million 

3 purchase obligations include commitments we have for the purchase of electricity natural gas and its transportation fuel air products electrodes alloys and zinc these arrangements have “take or pay” or other similar commitment provisions we have utilized such “take or pay” requirements during the past three years under these contracts except for certain air products at our minnesota ironmaking operations which have been idle since may 2015 

4 construction commitments relate to firm contracts we have with various vendors for the completion of certain construction projects at our various divisions at december 31 2018 

5 other commitments principally relate to deferred compensation plan obligations 

 

6 we expect to make cash outlays in the future related to our unrecognized tax benefits however due to the uncertainty of the timing we are unable to make reasonably reliable estimates regarding the period of cash settlement with the respective taxing authorities accordingly unrecognized tax benefits and related interest and penalties of 125 million as of december 31 2018 have been excluded from the contractual obligations table above refer to note 4 income taxes to the consolidated financial statements elsewhere in this report for additional information 

other matters 

inflation 

we believe that inflation has not had a material effect on our results of operations 

environmental and other contingencies 

we have incurred and in the future will continue to incur capital expenditures and operating expenses for matters relating to environmental control remediation monitoring and compliance during 2018 we incurred costs related to the monitoring and comp liance of environmental matters in the amount of approximately 423 million and capital expenditures related to environmental compliance of approximately 574000 of the costs incurred during 2018 for monitoring and compliance approximately 76 were related to the normal transportation of certain types of waste produced in our steelmaking processes and other facilities in accordance with legal requirements we incurred combined environmental remediation costs of approximately 267000 at all of our facilities during 2018 we have an accrual of 33 million recorded for environmental remediation related to our metals recycling operations and 26 million related to minnesota ironmaking operations we believe apart from our dependence on environmental construction and operating permits for our existing and any future manufacturing facilities that compliance with current environmental laws and regulations is not likely to have a materially adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or liquidity however environmental laws and regulations evolve and change and we may become subject to more stringent environmental laws and regulations in the future such as the impact of united states government or various governmental agencies introducing regulatory changes in response to the potential of climate change 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

management’s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states we review the accounting policies we use in reporting our financial results on a regular basis the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent liabilities we evaluate the appropriateness of these estimations and judgments on an ongoing basis we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources results may differ from these estimates due to actual outcomes being different from those on which we based our assumptions we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 

revenue recognition and allowance for doubtful accounts except for our steel fabrication operations we recognize revenues at the point in time the performance obligation is satisfied and control of the product is transferred to the customer upon shipment or delivery at the amount of consideration the company expects to receive including any variable consideration the variable consideration included in the company’s steel operations segment contracts which is not constrained include estimated product returns and customer claims and may include volume rebates which are recorded on an expected value basis our steel fabrication operations segment recognizes revenue over time at the amount of consideration the company expects to receive revenue is measured on an output method representing completed fabricated tons to date as a percentage of total tons required for each contract the company does not exercise significant judgements in determining the timing of satisfaction of performance obligations or the transaction price provision is made for estimated product returns and customer claims based on historical experience if the historical data used in our estimates does not reflect future returns and claims trends additional provision may be necessary the allowance for doubtful accounts is based on our best estimate of known credit risks historical experience and current economic conditions affecting our customers which estimates may or may not prove accurate 

﻿ 

we are exposed to credit risk in the event of nonpayment by our customers which in steel operations are principally intermediate steel processors and service centers that sell our products to numerous industry sectors including the construction automotive manufacturing transportation heavy and agriculture equipment and pipe and tube including octg markets our metals recycling operations sell ferrous scrap to steel mills and foundries and nonferrous scrap such as copper brass aluminum and stainless steel to among others ingot manufacturers copper refineries and mills smelters and specialty mills our steel fabrication operations sell fabricated steel joists and deck primarily to the nonresidential construction market we mitigate our exposure to credit risk which we generally extend initially on an unsecured basis by performing ongoing credit evaluations and taking further action when necessary such as requiring letters of credit or other security interests to support the customer receivable if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate resulting in the impairment of their ability to make payments additional allowance may be required 

 

inventories we record inventories at lower of cost or net realizable value cost is determined using a weighted average cost method for raw materials and supplies and on a firstin firstout basis for other inventory we record amounts required if any to reduce the carrying value of inventory to its net realizable value as a charge to cost of goods sold if product selling prices were to decline in future periods further writedown of inventory could result specifically raw material inventory such as scrap purchased during periods of peak market pricing 

impairments of longlived tangible and definite ‑lived intangible assets we review longlived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of such assets may not be fully recoverable impairment losses are recorded on longlived assets used in operations when indicators of impairment are present and the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than the assets’ carrying amounts the impairment loss is measured by comparing the fair value of the asset to its carrying amount we consider various factors and determine whether an impairment test is necessary including by way of examples a significant and prolonged deterioration in operating results andor projected cash flows significant changes in the extent or manner in which an asset is used technological advances with respect to assets which would potentially render them obsolete our strategy and capital planning and the economic climate in markets to be served when determining future cash flows and if necessary fair value we must make judgments as to the expected utilization of assets and estimated future cash flows related to those assets we consider historical and anticipated future results general economic and market conditions the impact of planned business and operational strategies and all other available information at the time the estimates are made those estimates and judgments may or may not ultimately prove accurate 

a longlived asset is classified as held for sale upon meeting specified criteria related to ability and intent to sell an asset classified as held for sale is measured at the lower of its carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell as of december 31 2018 and 2017 the company reported 83 million and 87 million respectively of assets held for sale within other current assets in our consolidated balance sheet an impairment loss is recognized for any initial or subsequent writedown of the asset held for sale to its fair value less cost to sell for assets determined to be classified as held for sale in the year ended december 31 2018 and 2017 the asset carrying amounts approximated their fair value less cost to sell the company determined fair value using level 3 fair value inputs as provided for under asc 820 consisting of information provided by brokers and other external sources along with management’s own assumptions 

﻿ 

significant events occurred during the fourth quarter of 2016 that represented impairment indicators related primarily to mining resources and mesabi mining fixed assets within our minnesota ironmaking operations the company therefore undertook a fourth quarter 2016 assessment of the recoverability of the carrying amounts of primarily our mining resources and mesabi mining operation’s fixed assets with the company’s outlook at the time of this 2016 assessment regarding future cash flows the company concluded that the carrying amounts of the fixed assets were no longer fully recoverable and they were in fact impaired this 2016 assessment resulted in a noncash asset impairment charge of 1273 million including amounts attributable to noncontrolling interests of 131 million which reduced net income attributable to steel dynamics inc by 729 million for the year ended december 31 2016 the carrying values of the impaired assets were adjusted to their estimated fair values at that time as determined primarily on the cost approach as well as expected future discounted cash flows an income approach using level 3 fair value inputs as provided for under asc 820 

goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets 

our goodwill relates to various business combinations and is allocated to the following reporting units at december 31 in thousands 

﻿ 

﻿ 



﻿ 

at least once annually as of october 1 or when indicators of impairment exist the company performs an impairment test for goodwill goodwill is allocated to various reporting units which are generally one level below the company’s operating segments we utilize a twostepped approach to evaluate goodwill impairment the first step of the test determines if there is potential goodwill impairment in this step the company compares the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying amount which includes goodwill the fair value of the reporting unit is determined by using an estimate of future cash flows utilizing a riskadjusted discount rate to calculate the net present value of future cash flows income approach and by using a market approach based upon an analysis of valuation metrics of comparable peer companies level 3 inputs as provided for under asc 820 if the fair value exceeds the carrying value there is no impairment if the carrying amount exceeds the fair value the company performs the second step of the test which measures the amount of impairment loss to be recorded in the second step the company compares the carrying amount of the goodwill to the implied fair value of the goodwill based on the net fair value of the recognized and unrecognized assets and liabilities of the reporting unit to which it is allocated if the implied fair value is less than the carrying value an impairment loss is recorded to the extent that the fair value of the goodwill is less than its carrying value 

 

key assumptions used to determine the estimated fair value of each reporting unit under the discounted cash flows method income approach include a expected cash flows for the fiveyear period following the testing date including market share sales volumes and prices costs to produce and estimated capital needs b an estimated terminal value using a terminal year growth rate determined based on the growth prospects of the reporting unit and c a riskadjusted discount rate based on management’s best estimate of market participants’ aftertax weighted average cost of capital and market risk premiums key assumptions used to determine the estimated fair value of each reporting unit under the market approach include the expected revenues and cash flows in the next year we consider historical and anticipated future results general economic and market conditions the impact of planned business and operational strategies and all available information at the time the fair values of its reporting units are estimated those estimates and judgments may or may not ultimately prove accurate 

goodwill acquired in past transactions are naturally more susceptible to impairment primarily due to the fact that they are recorded at fair value based on operating plans and economic conditions at the time of acquisition consequently if operating results andor economic conditions deteriorate after an acquisition it could result in the impairment of the acquired assets a deterioration of economic conditions may not only negatively impact the estimated operating cash flows used in our cash flow models but may also negatively impact other assumptions used in our analyses including but not limited to the estimated cost of capital andor discount rates additionally we are required to ensure that assumptions used to determine fair value in our analyses are consistent with the assumptions a hypothetical marketplace participant would use as a result the cost of capital andor discount rates used in our analyses may increase or decrease based on market conditions and trends regardless of whether our actual cost of capital has changed therefore we may recognize an impairment in spite of realizing actual cash flows that are approximately equal to or greater than our previously forecasted amounts 

our fourth quarter 2018 2017 and 2016 annual goodwill impairment analyses did not result in any impairment charges management does not believe that it is reasonably likely that our reporting units will fail step one of a goodwill impairment test in the near term as the determined fair value of the reporting units with goodwill exceeded their carrying value by more than an insignificant amount we will continue to monitor operating results within all reporting units throughout the upcoming year to determine if events and circumstances warrant interim impairment testing otherwise all reporting units will again be subject to the required annual impairment test during the fourth quarter of 2019 changes in judgments and estimates underlying our analysis of goodwill for possible impairment including expected future operating cash flows and discount rate could decrease the estimated fair value of our reporting units in the future and could result in an impairment of goodwill 

﻿ 

in 2016 a 55 million omnisource goodwill impairment charge was recorded in conjunction with omnisource entering into a definitive sale agreement with a thirdparty pertaining to certain omnisource longlived assets inventory and spare parts as provided under asc 350 

income taxes we are required to estimate our income taxes as a part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements this requires us to estimate our actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatments of items for tax and accounting purposes these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities which are included within our consolidated balance sheet we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely we must establish a valuation allowance we also establish reserves to reduce some or all of the tax benefit of any of our tax positions at the time we determine that the positions become uncertain we adjust these reserves including any impact on the related interest and penalties in light of changing facts and circumstances such as the progress of a tax audit a number of years may elapse before a particular matter for which we have established a reserve is audited by a taxing authority and finally resolved the number of years with open tax audits varies depending on the tax jurisdiction the tax benefit that has been previously reserved because of a failure to meet the more likely than not recognition threshold would be recognized in our income tax expense in the first interim period when the uncertainty disappears settlement of any particular issue would usually require the use of cash 

 




 item 7 a  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

market risk 

in the normal course of business we are exposed to interest rate changes our objectives in managing fluctuations in interest rates are to limit the impact of these rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower overall borrowing costs to achieve these objectives we may use interest rate swaps to manage net exposure to interest rate changes related to our portfolio of borrowings   

the following table represents the principal cash repayments and related weighted ‑average interest rates by maturity date for our longterm debt as of december 31 2018 in thousands 

﻿ 



﻿ 

commodity risk 

in the normal course of business we are exposed to the market risk and price fluctuations related to the sale of our products and to the purchase of raw materials used in our operations such as metallic raw materials electricity natural gas and its transportation services fuel air products zinc alloys and electrodes our risk strategy associated with product sales has generally been to obtain competitive prices for our products and to allow operating results to reflect market price movements dictated by supply and demand 

our risk strategy associated with the purchase of raw materials utilized within our operations has generally been to make some commitments with suppliers relating to future expected requirements for some commodities such as electricity natural gas and its transportation services fuel air products zinc alloys and electrodes certain of these commitments contain provisions which require us to “take or pay” for specified quantities without regard to actual usage for periods of up to 6 years for physical commodity requirements and commodity transportation requirements and for up to 14 years for air products our commitments for these arrangements with “take or pay” or other similar commitment provisions for the years ending december 31 are as follows in thousands 

﻿ 

﻿ 



﻿ 

we utilized such “take or pay” requirements during the past three years under these contracts except for certain air products at our minnesota ironmaking operations which have been idle since may 2015 we believe that production requirements will be such that consumption of the products or services purchased under these commitments will occur in the normal production process other than certain air products related to our minnesota ironmaking operations during the idle period we also purchase electricity consumed at our butler flat roll division pursuant to a contract which extends through december 2020 which establishes an agreed fixedrate energy charge per millkwh consumed for each year through the expiration of the agreement 

﻿ 

in our metals recycling and steel operations we have certain fixed price contracts with various customers and suppliers for future delivery of nonferrous and ferrous metals our risk strategy has been to enter into base metal financial contracts with the goal to protect the profit margin within certain parameters that was contemplated when we entered into the transaction with the customer or vendor at december 31 2018 we had a cumulative unrealized gain associated with these financial contracts of 668000 substantially all of which have settlement dates in 2019 we believe the customer contracts associated with the financial contracts will be fully consummated

industry segments 

﻿ 

we have three reporting segments steel operations metals recycling operations and steel fabrication operations refer to notes 1 and 13 in the notes to consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 of this form 10k for additional segment information 

﻿ 

  



﻿ 

steel operations consist of our six electric arc furnace steel mills producing steel from ferrous scrap and scrap substitutes utilizing continuous casting automated rolling mills and several downstream steel coating and bar processing lines and idi our liquid pig iron production facility that supplies solely the butler flat roll division our steel operations sell directly to endusers steel fabricators and service centers these products are used in numerous industry sectors including the construction automotive manufacturing transportation heavy and agriculture equipment and pipe and tube including octg markets our steel operations accounted for 72 of our consolidated net sales during 2017 and 2016  and 69 in 2015  we are predominantly a domestic steel company with only 5 4 and 5 of our revenues generated from exported sales during 2017   2016  and 2015  respectively 

our steel operations consist primarily of steelmaking and coating operations the following chart summarizes the locations and the current estimated production capacities of our facilities 

﻿ 



﻿ 

﻿ 

note steelmaking capacities represent manufacturing capabilities based on mill configuration and related employee support these capacities do not represent expected volumes in a given year in addition estimates of mill capacity are highly dependent on the specific product mix manufactured each of our mills can and do roll many different types and sizes of products therefore our capacity estimates assume a typical product mix 

﻿ 

 the techs galvanizing capacity is included in “steelmaking capacity” to represent the capability to utilize sheet steel substrate to produce galvanized sheet steel at their facilities 

 vulcan threaded products bar finishing capacity is included in “steelmaking capacity’ to represent the capability to utilize steel longproduct substrate to produce threaded rod and cold draw and heat treat bar products at their facility 

 

the following chart summarizes our steel operations products and the percentage of sales tons by end market 

 

sheet steel products 

our sheet steel products consisting of hot roll cold roll and coated steel products are produced by our butler and columbus flat roll divisions and our several downstream coating lines  including the techs  our sheet steel operations represented 71  70  and 65  of steel operations net sales in 2017  2016  and 2015  respectively we produced 71 million 69 million and 60 million tons of sheet steel at these facilities in 2017 2016 and 2015 respectively 

idi produces liquid pig iron and hot briquetted iron hbi that serves as a substitute for a portion of the metallic raw material mix that goes directly into our butler flat roll division electric arc furnaces to produce steel idi’s primary focus is to maximize liquid pig iron production due to the inherent economic benefits achieved at the steel mill when the material is used in the steelmaking process such as reduced energy cost reduced materials cost and quicker melting cycles during 2017 and 2016  respectively idi produced 259 000 and 255 000 metric tons of which 90 and 98 respectively   was liquid pig iron we have used and plan to continue to use all of the facility’s output internally 

﻿ 

the following chart summarizes the types of sheet steel products sold by sales dollars during the respective years 

customers steel processors and service centers typically act as intermediaries between primary sheet steel producers and the many enduser manufacturers that require further processing of hot roll coils the additional processing performed by the intermediate steel processors and service centers include pickling galvanizing cutting to length slitting to size leveling blanking shape correcting edge rolling shearing and stamping we believe that our intermediate steel processor and service center customers will remain an integral part of our customer base the columbus flat roll division allows us to capitalize on the industrial markets in the southern united states and mexico as well as further expand our customer base in painted and line and other pipe products galvanized flat roll products produced by our butler and columbus flat roll divisions and the techs are similar and are sold to a similar customer base however the techs specializes in the galvanizing of specific types of flat roll steels in primarily nonautomotive applications servicing a variety of customers in the heating ventilation and air conditioning hvac construction agriculture and consumer goods markets our sheet steel operations also provide a significant portion of the sheet steel utilized in our steel fabrication operations

customers the principal customers for our structural steel products are steel service centers steel fabricators and various manufacturers service centers though not the ultimate enduser provide valuable mill distribution functions to the fabricators and manufacturers including small quantity sales repackaging cutting preliminary processing and warehousing the steel rail marketplace in the united states canada and mexico is specialized and defined with seven class i railroads and a large distribution network 

sbq products are principally consumed by cold finishers forgers intermediate processors oem manufacturers steel service centers and distributors as well as pull through volume to vulcan our mbq products are sold primarily to steel service centers as well as reinforcing bar distributors joist producers and oems some of the excess steel billet production at the roanoke bar division is sold to mills without sufficient melting capacities including our steel of west virginia facility our steel fabrication operations also purchase angles from roanoke bar division steel of west virginia’s customers are primarily oems producing truck trailers industrial lift trucks merchant products guardrail posts manufactured housing mining and offhighway construction equipment steel of west virginia’s flexible manufacturing capabilities enable us to meet demand for a variety of customordered and designed products many of these products are produced in small quantities for low volume enduses resulting in a wide variety of customers the largest of which are in the truck trailer and industrial lift truck industries 

steel competition the markets in which we conduct business are highly competitive with an abundance of competition in the carbon steel industry from north american and foreign integrated and minimill steelmaking and processing operations we compete in numerous industry sections most significantly tied to the construction automotive and other manufacturing sectors in many applications within these industry sections steel competes with other materials such as aluminum cement composites plastics carbon fiber glass and wood some of our products are commodities subject to their own cyclical fluctuations in supply and demand however we are focused on providing a broader range of diversified valueadded products that deemphasize commodity steel the primary competitive influences on products we sell are price quality and valueadded services 

global steelmaking capacity exceeds global consumption of steel products such excess capacity sometimes results in steel manufacturers in certain countries exporting steel at prices that are lower than prevailing domestic prices and sometimes at or below their cost to produce excessive imports of steel in the united states such as in 2017 and more so in 2015 intensifies price competition on the domestic steel industry which negatively affects our ability to increase our selling prices and realize higher margins and profitability

the metals recycling operations consists solely of omnisource and includes both ferrous and nonferrous scrap metal processing transportation marketing and brokerage services strategically located primarily in close proximity to our steel mills and other enduser scrap consumers throughout the eastern half of the united states in addition omnisource designs installs and manages customized scrap management programs for industrial manufacturing companies at hundreds of locations throughout north america our metals recycling operations accounted for 15 of our consolidated net sales during 2017 and 2016 and 19 in   2015  our steel mills utilize a portion of the ferrous scrap processed through omnisource as raw material in our steelmaking operations and the remainder is sold to other consumers such as other steel manufacturers and foundries this strategic symbiotic relationship with our own steelmaking operations provides valuable pullthrough demand to omnisource’s ferrous scrap operations in 2017  2016  and 2015  omnisource provided our steel operations with 38  40  and 41  respectively of its ferrous scrap requirements  

we shipped the following from our metals recycling operations 

﻿ 



﻿ 

 

we sell various grades of processed ferrous scrap primarily to steel mills and foundries ferrous scrap metal is the primary raw material for electric arc furnaces such as our steel mills in addition we sell various grades of nonferrous metals such as copper brass aluminum and stainless steel to aluminum steel and ingot manufacturers brass and bronze ingot makers copper refineries and mills smelters specialty mills alloy manufacturers and other consumers 

we purchase ferrous and nonferrous scrap metals processed and unprocessed in a variety of forms for our metals recycling facilities 

ferrous scrap comes from two primary sources 





nonferrous scrap comes from three primary sources 







we do not purchase a significant amount of scrap metal from a single source or from a limited number of major sources market demand and the composition quality size weight and location of the materials are the primary factors that determine prices 

products our metals recycling operations primarily involve the purchase processing and resale of ferrous and nonferrous scrap metals into reusable forms and grades we process an array of ferrous products through a variety of methods including sorting shredding shearing cutting torching baling briquetting and breaking our major ferrous products include heavy melting steel busheling bundled scrap shredded scrap and other scrap metal products such as steel turnings and cast iron these products vary in properties or attributes related to cleanness size of individual pieces and residual alloys the necessary characteristics of the ferrous products are determined by the specific needs and requirements of the consumer and affect the individual product’s relative value we process various grades of nonferrous products including aluminum brass copper stainless steel and other nonferrous metals additionally we provide transportation logistics truck rail and river barge  marketing brokerage and scrap management services 

customers we sell various grades of processed ferrous scrap to endusers such as electric arc furnace steel mills integrated steelmakers foundries secondary smelters and metal brokers who aggregate materials for other large users ferrous scrap metal is the primary raw material for electric arc furnaces such as our steel mills most of our ferrous scrap customers purchase processed scrap through negotiated spot sales contracts which establish a quantity purchase for the month the price we charge for ferrous scrap depends upon market demand and pricing t ransportation costs as well as the quality and grade of the scrap we sell various grades of processed nonferrous scrap to endusers such as aluminum sheet and ingot manufacturers brass and bronze ingot makers copper refineries mills smelters specialty steelmakers alloy manufacturers wire and cable producers utilities and telephone networks the price we charge for nonferrous scrap depends upon market demand and pricing t ransportation costs as well as the quality and grade of the scrap 

competition scrap is a global commodity influenced by conditions in a number of industrialized and emerging markets throughout asia europe and north america the markets for scrap metals are highly competitive both in the purchase of raw or unprocessed scrap and the sale of processed scrap with regard to the purchase of unprocessed scrap we compete with numerous independent recyclers as well as smaller scrap companies engaged only in collecting obsolete scrap in many cases  we also purchase unprocessed scrap metal from smaller scrap dealers and other processors successful procurement of materials is determined primarily by the price offered by the purchaser for the raw scrap and the proximity of our processing facility to the source of the raw scrap both ferrous and nonferrous scrap sells as a commodity in both domestic and international markets which are affected sometimes significantly by relative economic conditions currency fluctuations and the availability and cost of transportation competition for sales of processed scrap is based primarily on the price quality and location of the scrap metals as well as the level of service provided in terms of reliability and timing of delivery 

we also face potential competition for sales of processed scrap from other producers of steel products such as electric arc furnace and integrated steel mills some of which like us are also vertically integrated in the scrap metals recycling business in addition other steel mills may compete with us in attempting to secure scrap supply through direct purchasing from our scrap suppliers scrap metal processors also face competition from substitutes for prepared ferrous scrap such as prereduced iron pellets hbi pig iron direct reduced iron dri and other forms of processed iron the availability and relative prices of substitutes for ferrous scrap could result in a decreased demand for processed ferrous scrap and could result in lower prices andor lower demand for our scrap products 

the industry is highly fragmented with many smaller familyowned companies many regional scrap companies along with a number of national and global companies each of which has multiple locations in areas in which omnisource also operates no single scrap metals recycler has a significant market share in the domestic market

other operations consists of subsidiary operations that are below the quantitative thresholds required for reportable segments and primarily consist of our idled minnesota ironmaking operations and smaller joint ventures also included in “other” are certain unallocated corporate accounts such as the company’s senior secured credit facility senior notes certain other investments and certain profit sharing expenses  

 

sources availability and cost of steel and other operations’ raw materials 

scrap metals the principal raw material of our steel operations is scrap metal derived from among other sources “home scrap” generated internally at steel mills themselves industrial scrap generated as a byproduct of manufacturing and “obsolete” scrap recycled from endoflife automobiles appliances railroad cars and railroad track materials agricultural machinery and demolition scrap from obsolete structures containers and machines 

ferrous scrap typically comprises more than 80 of the metallic melt mix in electric arc furnace steelmaking in contrast to integrated mill steelmaking where the proportion of scrap has traditionally been approximately 25 to 35 depending upon the scrap substitute material that may be available from time to time and the relative cost of such material the percentage of scrap used in our steelmaking operations could be increased or reduced in our metallic melt mix 

many variables can impact ferrous scrap prices all of which reflect the pushes and pulls of the supply demand equation these factors include the level of domestic steel production high quality lowresidual scrap is a byproduct of steel manufacturing activity the level of exports of scrap from the united states and the amount of obsolete scrap production in addition domestic ferrous scrap prices generally have a strong correlation and spread to global pig iron pricing generally as domestic steel demand increases so does scrap demand and resulting scrap prices the reverse is also normally but not always true with scrap prices following steel prices downward when supply exceeds demand scrap prices declined sharply in 2015 due to domestic scrap competition the strong united states dollar tempering scrap exports decreasing global pig iron prices and lower steel mill utilization rates resulting from excessive record levels of steel imports these excess sheet steel imports declined during 2016 with duties levied pursuant to the trade case rulings from the united states international trade commission resulting in increased domestic steel mill utilization resulting in improved scrap pricing steel imports once again rose during 2017 mostly related to structural and prefabricated structural long products but also cold roll and coated sheet steel causing pressure on steel selling prices in those markets however scrap prices continued to climb in 2017 due to strong domestic steel mill utilization and lower scrap exports combined with additional supply from dri projects and prime scrap when scrap prices greatly accelerate this can challenge one of the principal elements of an electric arc furnace based steel mill’s traditional lower cost structure—the cost of its metallic raw material

iron units   in addition to scrap dri  hbi pig iron and iron nuggets are used in our electric arc furnace steel mill production during 2017  2016  and 2015  we consumed 103 million  99 million and 88 million tons respectively of metallic materials in our steelmaking furnaces of which iron units other than scrap represen ted approximately 13 14 and 12 of the tons  respectively of these iron substitute units consumed our idi operation supplies 100 of its production to the butler flat roll division mill representing 72  65  and 66  of their iron units in 2017   2016  and 2015  respectively  

energy resources 

electricity     electricity is a significant input required in the electric arc furnaces in our steelmaking operations excluding the techs and vulcan representing 6 7 and 6 of steel production costs of goods sold in 2017 2016 and 2015 respectively we have entered into fixed price electricity contracts for the butler flat roll division columbus flat roll division roanoke bar division and steel of west virginia while our engineered bar products division has a combination of fixed pricing and market pricing for the various components of the electrical services demand charge energy charge riders etc our structural and rail division purchases electricity at current market prices and through forward contracts at fixed prices 

patents and trademarks 

we currently do not own any material patents or patent applications for technologies that are in use in our production processes we have the following major registered trademarks as follows 















research and development 

our research and development activities have consisted of efforts to expand develop and improve our products and operating processes and our efforts to develop and improve alternative ironmaking technologies through idi most of these research and development efforts have been conducted inhouse by our employees 

environmental matters 

our operations are subject to substantial and evolving local state and federal environmental health and safety laws and regulations concerning among other things emissions to the air discharges to surface and ground water and to sewer systems and the generation handling storage transportation treatment and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes   and secondary materials our operations are dependent upon permits regulating discharges into the air or into the water or the use and handling of byproducts in order to operate our facilities we dedicate considerable resources aimed at achieving compliance with federal and state laws concerning the environment while we do not currently believe that our future compliance efforts with such provisions will have a material adverse effect on our results of operations cash flows or financial condition this is subject to change in the everevolving regulatory environment in which we operate 

since the level of enforcement of environmental laws and regulations or the nature of those laws that may be enacted from time to time are subject to changing social or political pressures our environmental capital expenditures and costs for environmental compliance may increase in the future in addition due to the possibility of unanticipated regulatory or other developments the amount and timing of future environmental expenditures may vary substantially from those currently anticipated the cost of current and future environmental compliance may also place united states steel producers at a competitive disadvantage with respect to foreign steel producers which may not be required to undertake equivalent costs in their operations 

 

pursuant to the resource conservation and recovery act or rcra which governs the treatment handling and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes the united states environmental protection agency or united states epa and authorized state environmental agencies may conduct inspections to identify alleged violations or areas where there may have been releases of solid or hazardous constituents into the environment and require the facilities to take corrective action to remediate any such releases rcra also allows citizens to bring certain suits against regulated facilities for potential damages and cleanup our steelmaking and certain other facilities generate wastes subject to rcra our operations produce various byproducts some of which for example electric arc furnace or eaf dust are often categorized as hazardous waste requiring special handling for disposal or for the recovery of metallics we collect such byproducts in pollution control equipment such as baghouses and either recycle or appropriately dispose of these byproducts while we cannot predict the future actions of the regulators or other interested parties the potential exists for required corrective action at these facilities the costs of which could be substantial 

under the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability known as “cercla” or “superfund” the united states epa and in some instances private parties have the authority to impose joint and several liability for the remediation of contaminated properties upon generators of waste current and former site owners and operators transporters and other potentially responsible parties regardless of fault or the legality of the original disposal activity many states have statutes and regulatory authorities similar to cercla and to the united states epa we have a number of material handling agreements with various contractors to properly dispose of or recycle our electric arc furnace dust and certain other byproducts of our operations however we cannot assure that even if there has been no fault by us we may not still be cited as a waste generator by reason of an environmental cleanup at a site to which our byproducts were transported 

the clean water act and similar state laws apply to aspects of our operations and impose regulatory restrictions related to the discharge of wastewater storm water and dredged or fill material united states epa states and in certain instances private parties have the ability to bring suit alleging violations and seeking penalties and damages the clean water act’s provisions can require new or expanded water treatment investments to be made and can limit or even prohibit certain current or planned activities at our operations 

the clean air act and analogous state laws require many of our facilities to obtain and maintain air permits in order to operate air permits can impose new or expanded obligations to limit or prevent current or future emissions and to add costly pollution control equipment enforcement for alleged violations can be brought by the united states epa the states and in certain instances private parties and can result in penalties and injunctive relief 

in addition there are a number of other environmental health and safety laws and regulations that apply to our facilities and may affect our operations by way of example and not of limitation certain portions of the federal toxic substances control act oil pollution act safe drinking water act and emergency planning and community righttoknow act as well as state and local laws and regulations implemented by the regulatory agencies apply to aspects of our facilities’ operations in some instances we may also be subject to foreign governments’ regulations and international treaties and laws many of these laws allow both the governments and citizens to bring certain suits against regulated facilities for alleged environmental violations finally our operations could be subject to certain toxic tort suits brought by citizens or other third parties alleging causes of action such as nuisance negligence trespass infliction of emotional distress or other claims alleging personal injury or property damage 

employees 

we emphasize decentralized decision making and responsibility and have established performancebased incentive compensation programs specifically designed to enhance productivity improve profitability control costs and foster innovation our work force consisted of approximately 7635 full time employees at december 31 2017  of which approximately 9 were represented by collective bargaining agreements the largest group of unionized employees is at steel of west virginia the remaining unionized employees are located in four different omnisource metals recycling locations each of which has its own agreement we believe that our relationship with our employees is good

 item 1 a  risk factors 

many factors could have an effect on our financial condition cash flows and results of operations we are subject to various risks resulting from changing economic environmental political industry business and financial conditions the factors described below represent our principal risks 

risks related to our industry 

global steelmaking overcapacity and imports of steel into the united states have adversely affected and may continue to adversely affect united states steel prices which may adversely affect our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

global steelmaking capacity currently exceeds global consumption of steel products which adversely affects united states and global steel prices such excess capacity sometimes results in steel manufacturers in certain countries exporting steel and steel products including prefabricated longproduct steel at prices that are lower than prevailing domestic prices and sometimes at or below their cost of production excessive imports of steel and steel products including prefabricated steel into the united states such as in recent years have exerted and may continue to exert downward pressure on united states steel and steel products prices  which adversely affects our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows furthermore anticipated additional domestic steel capacity could increase this global overcapacity this in turn may also adversely impact domestic demand for ferrous scrap and our ferrous metallics margins united states steel producers compete with many foreign producers including those in china vietnam and other asian and european countries competition from foreign producers is typically strong and is periodically exacerbated by weakening of the economies of certain foreign steelmaking countries additionally low iron ore prices resulting in disruption of the scrap price correlation to iron ore  leads to reduced global costs to produce steel further depressing steel import prices a higher volume of steel exports to the united states tend to occur at depressed prices when steel producing countries experience periods of economic difficulty decreased demand for steel products or excess capacity the global steelmaking overcapacity is exacerbated by chinese steel production capacity that far exceeds that country’s demand and has made china a major global exporter of steel resulting in weakened global steel pricing than otherwise would be expected 

in addition we believe the downward pressure on and periodically depressed levels of united states steel prices in recent years have been further accentuated   through imports of steel involving dumping and subsidy abuses by foreign steel producers some foreign steel producers are owned controlled or subsidized by foreign governments as a result decisions by these producers with respect to their production sales and pricing are sometimes influenced to a greater degree by political and economic policy considerations than by prevailing market conditions realities of the marketplace or consideration of profit or loss however while some tariffs duties and quotas have been put into effect for certain steel products imported from a number of countries that have been found to have been unfairly pricing steel imports to the united states some foreign steel subject to these duties tariffs and quotas circumvent the penalties by processing in or transporting through a foreign country not subject to the penalties additionally there is no assurance that already imposed tariffs duties and quotas will remain in place or that new ones even if justified will be levied and even when imposed many of these are only shortlived when such tariffs duties or quotas expire or if others are further relaxed or repealed or if relatively higher united states steel prices make it attractive for foreign steelmakers to export their steel products to the united states despite the presence of duties tariffs or quotas the resurgence of substantial imports of foreign steel could create downward pressure on united states steel prices 

our industry as well as the industries of many of our customers and suppliers upon whom we are dependent is affected by domestic and global economic factors including periods of slower than anticipated economic growth and the risk of a new recession 

our financial results are substantially dependent not only upon overall economic conditions in the united states and globally including europe and in asia but also as they may affect one or more of the industries upon which we depend for the sale of our products g lobal actions including political actions could result in changing economic conditions in the united states and globally the effects of which are not known at this time additionally periods of slower than anticipated economic growth could reduce customer confidence and adversely affect demand for our products and further adversely affect our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows metals industries have historically been vulnerable to significant declines in consumption and product pricing during periods of economic downturn or continued uncertainty including the pace of domestic nonresidential construction activity 

our business is also dependent upon certain industries such as construction automotive manufacturing transportation heavy and agriculture equipment and pipe and tube including octg markets and these industries are also cyclical in nature therefore these industries may experience their own fluctuations in demand for our products based on such things as economic conditions raw material and energy costs consumer demand and infrastructure funding decisions by governments many of these factors are beyond our control as a result of volatility in our industry or in the industries we serve we may have difficulty increasing or maintaining our level of sales or profitability if our industry or the industries we serve were to suffer a downturn then we may experience an adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

 

a prospective decline in consumer and business confidence and spending which is often coupled with reductions in the availability of credit or increased cost of credit as well as volatility in the capital and credit markets could adversely affect the business and economic environment in which we operate and the profitability of our business we are also exposed to risks associated with the creditworthiness of our suppliers and customers if the availability of credit to fund or support the continuation and expansion of our customers’ business operations is curtailed or if the cost of that credit is increased the resulting inability of our customers or of their customers to either access credit or absorb the increased cost of that credit could adversely affect our business by reducing our sales or by increasing our exposure to losses from uncollectible customer accounts a disruption of the credit markets could also result in financial instability of some of our suppliers and customers the consequences of such adverse effects could include the interruption of production at the facilities of our customers the reduction delay or cancellation of customer orders delays or interruptions of the supply of raw materials we purchase and bankruptcy of customers suppliers or other creditors any of these events may adversely affect our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

our level of production and our sales and earnings are subject to significant fluctuations as a result of the cyclical nature of the steel industry and some of the industries we serve 

the steel manufacturing business is cyclical in nature and the selling price of the steel we make may fluctuate significantly due to many factors beyond our control furthermore a number of our products are commodities subject to their own cyclical fluctuations in supply and demand in both metal consuming and metal generating industries including the construction and manufacturing industries the timing magnitude and duration of these cycles and the resulting price fluctuations are difficult to predict the sale of our manufactured steel products is directly affected by demand for our products in other cyclical industries such as construction automotive manufacturing transportation heavy and agriculture equipment and pipe and tube including octg markets economic difficulties stagnant or slow global economies supplydemand imbalances and currency fluctuations in the united states or globally could decrease the demand for our products or increase the amount of imports of steel into the united states which could decrease our sales margins and profitability 

the scrap metal recycling industry has historically been and is expected to remain highly cyclical and this could have a material adverse effect on our metals recycling operations’ results 

scrap metal prices remain volatile and operating results within the metals recycling industry in general have historically been and are expected to remain highly cyclical in nature similarly but not necessarily paralleling the price fluctuations in the steel business the purchase prices for automobile bodies and various other grades of obsolete and industrial scrap as well as the selling prices for processed and recycled scrap metals we utilize in our own manufacturing process or which we resell to others through our metals recycling operations are also volatile during periods of excess domestic supply or increased imports scrap metal prices may become or remain depressed and adversely affect the sales profitability and margins of our scrap business as a metals recycler we may attempt to respond to changing recycled metal selling prices by adjusting the scrap metal purchase prices we pay to others but our ability to do this may be limited by competitive or other factors during periods of low scrap prices when inbound scrap flow may slow considerably as scrap generators hold on to their scrap in hopes of getting higher prices later as such a prolonged period of low scrap prices could reduce our ability to obtain process and sell recycled materials and this could adversely affect our metals recycling operations’ results conversely periodic increased foreign demand for scrap can result in an outflow of available domestic scrap as well as resulting higher scrap prices domestically that cannot always be passed on to domestic scrap consumers thereby further reducing available domestic scrap flows and scrap margins all of which could adversely affect our sales and profitability of our metals recycling operations additionally during periods of high demand and resulting higher scrap prices ferrous scrap consumers may seek and develop ferrous scrap alternatives including pig iron and dri the availability and pricing of these scrap alternatives in the domestic market may have a longer term impact on scrap pricing particularly in prime grades which could adversely affect our sales profitability and margins 

volatility and major fluctuations in scrap metal pig iron zinc and graphite electrode prices and availability and our potential inability to pass higher costs on to our customers may constrain operating levels and reduce profit margins 

steel producers require large amounts of raw materials including scrap metal and scrap substitute products such as pig iron pelletized iron and other supplies such as zinc graphite electrodes and ferroalloys our principal raw material is scrap metal derived primarily from endoflife automobiles industrial scrap railroad cars railroad track materials agricultural machinery and demolition scrap from obsolete structures containers and machines the prices for scrap are subject to market forces largely beyond our control including demand by united states and international steel producers freight costs and speculation the prices for scrap have varied significantly in the past  may vary significantly in the future and do not necessarily fluctuate in tandem with the price of steel moreover some of our integrated steel producer competitors are not as dependent as we are on scrap as a part of their raw material melt mix which during periods of high scrap costs relative to the cost of blast furnace iron used by the integrated producers give them a raw material cost advantage over minimills while our vertical integration into the metals recycling business through our omnisource operations and into the ironmaking business through our idi facility should enable us to continue being a costeffective supplier to our own steelmaking operations for some of our metallics requirements we will still need to rely on other metallics and raw material suppliers as well as upon general industry supply conditions for the balance of our needs 

purchase prices for auto bodies scrap metal and scrap substitute products such as pig iron that we consume and selling prices for scrap and recycled metals that we sell to third parties are volatile and beyond our control while omnisource attempts to respond to changing recycled metal selling prices through adjustments to its metal purchase prices its ability to do so is limited by competitive and other market factors changing prices could potentially impact the volume of scrap metal available to us and the volume and realized margins of processed metals we sell 

 

the availability and prices of raw materials may also be negatively affected by new or existing laws and regulations allocation by suppliers interruptions in production accidents or natural disasters changes in exchange rates global price fluctuations the availability and cost of transportation and competing uses for raw materials as a major producer of galvanized steel products we purchase and consume a large amount of zinc which is currently at historically high prices and may have an effect on our profit margins due to its use in other industries demand for the primary   raw material needle coke used in the production of graphite electrodes has recently expanded leading to increased price of graphite electrodes  and possible shortage  graphite electrodes are a critical raw material in our steelmaking any inability to secure a consistent supply of graphite electrodes could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations or prospects 

if prices for ferrous metallics increase by a greater margin than corresponding price increases for the sale of our steel products we may not be able to recoup such cost increases from increases in the selling prices of steel products conversely depressed prices for ferrous scrap may constrain its supply which may adversely affect our metals recycling operations and also the availability of certain grades of scrap for our steelmaking operations additionally our inability to pass on all or any substantial part of any cost increases during periods of rapidly rising scrap prices through scrap or other surcharges or to provide for our customers’ needs because of the potential unavailability of key raw materials or other inputs may result in production slow downs or curtailments or may otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations or prospects 

the cost and availability of electricity and natural gas are also subject to volatile market conditions 

steel producers like us consume large amounts of energy inasmuch as minimills melt ferrous scrap in electric arc furnaces and use natural gas to reheat steel or steel billets for rolling into finished products we rely on third parties for the supply of energy resources we consume in our steelmaking activities the prices for and availability of electricity natural gas oil and other energy resources are also subject to volatile market conditions often affected by weather conditions as well as political and economic factors beyond our control as large consumers of electricity and gas we must have dependable delivery in order to operate accordingly we are at risk in the event of an energy disruption including power outages or power unavailability prolonged blackouts or brownouts or disruptions caused by natural disasters or by political considerations would substantially disrupt our production since a significant portion of our finished steel pr oducts are delivered by truck u nforeseen fluctuations in the price of fuel attributable to fluctuations in crude oil prices would also have a negative impact on our costs or on the costs of many of our customers in addition changes in certain environmental regulations in the united states including those that may impose output limitations or higher costs associated with climate change or greenhouse gas emissions legislation could substantially increase the cost of manufacturing and raw materials such as energy to us and other united states steel producers 

fluctuations in the value of the united states dollar relative to other currencies may adversely affect our business 

fluctuations in the value of the dollar can be expected to affect our business a strong united states dollar such as recently experienced  makes imported products less expensive potentially resulting in more imports of steel products into the united states by our foreign competitors while a weak united states dollar may have the opposite impact on imports 

compliance with and changes in environmental and remediation requirements could result in substantially increased capital requirements and operating costs 

existing laws or regulations as currently interpreted or as may be interpreted in the future as well as future laws or regulations may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

we are subject to comprehensive local state federal and international statutory and regulatory environmental requirements relating to among other things 























compliance with environmental laws and regulations which affect our steelmaking metals recycling ironmaking and copper and aluminum production operations is a significant factor in our business we are required to obtain and comply with environmental permits and licenses and failure to obtain or renew or the violation of any permit or license could result in substantial fines and penalties capital expenditures operational changes suspension of operations andor the closure of a subject facility similarly delays increased costs andor the imposition of onerous conditions to the securing or renewal of permits could have a material adverse effect on these operations 

 

private parties might also bring claims against us under citizen suit provisions andor for property damage or personal injury allegedly resulting from our operations moreover legal requirements change frequently are subject to interpretation and have tended to become more stringent over time uncertainty regarding adequate pollution control levels testing and sampling procedures and new pollution control technology are factors that may increase our future compliance expenditures we are unable to predict the ultimate cost of future compliance with environmental requirements or their effect on our operations although we work hard to be in substantial compliance with all applicable laws and regulations legal requirements frequently change and are subject to interpretation new laws regulations and changing interpretations by regulatory authorities together with uncertainty regarding the application of existing requirements are among the factors that may increase our future expenditures to comply with environmental requirements the cost of complying with existing laws or regulations as currently interpreted or reinterpreted in the future or with future laws or regulations may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

our manufacturing and metals recycling operations produce significant amounts of byproducts some of which are handled as solid or hazardous waste for example our steel mills generate electric arc furnace eaf dust which the united states environmental protection agency united states epa and other regulatory authorities classify as hazardous waste and regulate accordingly unless recycled in an exempt manner 

in addition the primary feed materials for the shredders operated by our metals recycling operations include automobile bodies and obsolete household appliances a portion of the feed materials consist of unrecyclable material known as shredder residue if laws or regulations the interpretation of the laws or regulations or testing methods change with regard to eaf dust or shredder residue or other byproducts created by our operations we may incur significant additional expenditures 

federal and state environmental laws enable the united states epa state agencies and certain private parties to recover from owners operators generators and transporters the cost of investigation and cleanup of sites at which wastes or hazardous substances were disposed in connection with these laws we may be required to clean up contamination discovered at our sites including contamination that may have been caused by former owners or operators of the sites to conduct additional cleanup at sites that have already had some cleanup performed andor to perform cleanup with regard to sites formerly used in connection with our operations 

in addition we may be required to pay for or to pay a portion of the costs of cleanup at sites to which we sent materials for disposal or recycling notwithstanding that the original disposal or recycling activity may have complied with all regulatory requirements then in effect under certain laws a party can be held jointly and severally liable for all of the cleanup costs associated with a disposal site in practice a liable party often splits the costs of cleanup with other potentially responsible parties we have received notices from the united states epa state agencies and third parties that we have been identified as potentially responsible for the cost of investigating and cleaning up a number of disposal sites in most cases many other parties are also named as potentially responsible parties 

because cleanup liability can in some cases be imposed retroactively on activities that occurred many years ago and because the united states epa and state agencies are still discovering sites that pose a threat to public health or the environment we can provide no assurance that we will not become liable for significant costs associated with investigation and remediation of cleanup sites 

increased regulation associated with climate change and greenhouse gas ghg emissions could impose significant costs on both our steelmaking and metals recycling operations 

the united states government or various governmental agencies may introduce regulatory changes in response to the potential impacts of climate change international treaties or agreements may also result in increasing regulation of ghg emissions including the introduction of carbon emissions limitations or trading mechanisms any such regulation regarding climate change and greenhouse gas or ghg emissions could impose significant costs on our operations and on the operations of our customers and suppliers including increased energy capital equipment emissions controls environmental monitoring and reporting and other costs in order to comply with current or future laws or regulations concerning and limitations imposed on our operations by virtue of climate change and ghg emissions laws and regulations any adopted future climate change and ghg regulations could negatively impact our ability and that of our customers and suppliers to compete with companies situated in areas not subject to or not complying with such limitations 

from a medium and longterm perspective we are likely to see an increase in costs relating to our assets that emit significant amounts of greenhouse gases as a result of these regulatory initiatives these regulatory initiatives may impact our operations directly or through our suppliers or customers until the timing scope and extent of any future regulation becomes known we cannot predict the effect on our financial condition operating performance and ability to compete 

risks related to the business 

our senior secured credit facility contains and any future financing agreements may contain restrictive covenants that may limit our flexibility 

restrictions and covenants in our existing debt agreements including our senior secured credit facility and any future financing agreements may impair our ability to finance future operations or capital needs or to engage in other business activities specifically these agreements may limit or restrict our ability to 







 















a breach of any of the restrictions or covenants could cause a default under our senior secured credit facility our senior notes or our other debt a significant portion of our indebtedness then may become immediately due and payable if the default is not remedied 

under our senior secured credit facility we are required to maintain certain financial covenants tied to our leverage and profitability our ability to meet such covenants or other restrictions can be affected by events beyond our control if a default were to occur the lenders could elect to declare all amounts then outstanding to be immediately due and payable and terminate all commitments to extend further credit if we are unable to repay those amounts the lenders could proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure such indebtedness we have pledged substantially all of our receivables and inventories and all shares of capital stock or other equity interests of our subsidiaries and intercompany debt held by us as collateral for our senior secured credit facility 

we may face significant price and other forms of competition from other steel producers scrap processors and alternative materials which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operation or prospects 

the global markets in which steel companies and scrap processors conduct business are highly competitive and became even more so due to consolidations in the steel and scrap industries additionally in many applications steel competes with other materials such as aluminum cement composites plastics carbon fiber glass and wood increased use of alternative materials could decrease demand for steel and combined with increased competition could cause us to lose market share increase expenditures or reduce pricing any one of which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations or prospects the global steel industry suffers from overcapacity and that excess capacity intensifies price competition for some of our products a decrease in the global demand for steel scrap due to market or other conditions generally causes a decrease in the price of scrap metals a decrease in price could result in some scrap generators exiting the marketplace which could further decrease the availability of scrap this shortage in availability of scrap could have a material adverse effect on both our steelmaking and our metals recycling operations and thus on our business financial condition results of operations or prospects 

we are subject to significant risks relating to changes in commodity prices and may not be able to effectively protect against these risks 

we are exposed to commodity price risk during periods where we hold scrap metal inventory for processing or resale prices of commodities including scrap can be volatile due to numerous factors beyond our control in an increasing price environment for raw materials competitive conditions may limit our ability to pass on price increases to our consumers in a decreasing price environment for processed scrap we may not have the ability to fully recoup the cost of raw materials that we procure process and sell to our customers in addition new entrants into the market areas we serve could result in higher purchase prices for raw materials and lower margins from our scrap w hile we typically hedge certain commodities in which the futures market is well developed w e have not hedged positions in certain commodities where futures markets are not well established thus our sales and inventory position will be vulnerable to adverse changes in commodity prices which could materially adversely impact our operating and financial performance 

availability of an adequate source of supply is required for our metals recycling operations 

we procure our scrap inventory from numerous sources these suppliers generally are not bound by longterm contracts and have no obligation to sell recyclable metal to us in periods of low industry prices suppliers may elect to hold recyclable metal to wait for higher prices or intentionally slow their metal collection activities if a substantial number of suppliers cease selling recyclable metal to us we will be unable to recycle metal at desired levels and our results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected in addition a slowdown of industrial production in the united states reduces the supply of industrial grades of metal to the metal recycling industry resulting in our having less recyclable metal available to process and market 

we are subject to cybersecurity threats and may face risks to the security of our information technology 

increased global cybersecurity and information technology security requirements vulnerabilities threats and a rise in sophisticated and targeted cybercrime pose a risk to the security and functionality of our systems our information networks and to the confidentiality availability and integrity of sensitive data including intellectual property proprietary information financial information customer supplier and business partner information and personally identifiable information any of which could have materially adverse economic consequences additionally such cybersecurity vulnerabilities or attacks could result in an interruption of the functionality of our automated and electronically controlled manufacturing operating systems which if compromised could cease threaten delay or slow down our ability to melt roll or otherwise process steel or any of our other products for the duration of such interruption which could have materially adverse economic consequences 

 

although we believe we have adopted procedures and controls to adequately protect our sensitive data networks and information and operating technology and systems there can be no assurance that a system or network failure or cybersecurity breach will be prevented whether due to attacks by cyber criminals or due to employee error or malfeasance this could lead to system interruption production delays or downtimes and operational disruptions and the disclosure modification or destruction of sensitive data which could have an adverse effect on our reputation customer supplier and business partner relationships financial results and results of operations and could result in litigation or regulatory investigations or actions additionally as cybersecurity threats continue to evolve and become more sophisticated we may need to invest additional resources to protect the security of our systems and information networks 

we may face risks associated with the implementation of our growth strategy 

our growth strategy subjects us to various risks as part of our growth strategy we may expand existing facilities enter into new product or process initiatives acquire or build additional plants acquire other businesses and assets enter into joint ventures or form strategic alliances that we believe will complement our existing business these transactions will likely involve some or all of the following risks 

































these initiatives or transactions might be required for us to remain competitive but we may not be able to complete any such transactions on favorable terms or obtain financing if necessary future transactions may not improve our competitive position and business prospects as anticipated and if they do not our business financial condition results of operations or prospects may be adversely affected 

impairment charges could adversely affect our results of operations 

occasionally assumptions that we have made regarding products or businesses we have acquired or sought to develop about the sustainability of markets we sought to exploit or about i ndustry conditions that underlie our decision making when we elected to capitalize a venture turn out differently than anticipated in such instances the fair value of such assets may fall below their carrying value recorded on our balance sheet 

accordingly we periodically test goodwill and longlived tangible and intangible assets to determine whether their estimated fair value is in fact less than their value recorded on our balance sheet if we determine that the fair value of any of these assets from whatever cause is less than the value recorded on our balance sheet we are required to incur noncash asset impairment charges such as those recorded in current and past years that adversely affect our results of operations there can be no assurances that continued market dynamics or other factors may not result in future impairment charges 

we are subject to litigation and legal compliance risks which could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and liquidity 

we are involved from time to time in various routine litigation matters including administrative proceedings regulatory proceedings governmental investigations environmental matters and commercial and construction contract disputes none of which at the present time are expected to have a material impact on our financial conditions results of operations or liquidity for additional information regarding legal proceedings please refer to item 3 legal proceedings  

in addition to risks associated with our environmental and other regulatory compliance our international operations are subject to complex foreign and united states laws and regulations including the foreign corrupt practices act regulations related to importexport controls the office of foreign assets control and other laws and regulations each of which may increase our cost of doing business and expose us to increased risk 

 

unexpected equipment downtime or shutdowns could adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and prospects 

interruptions in our production capabilities could adversely affect our production costs products available for sale and earnings during the affected period in addition to equipment failures our facilities are also subject to the risk of catastrophic loss due to unanticipated events such as fires explosions or violent weather conditions our manufacturing processes are dependent upon critical pieces of steelmaking equipment such as our furnaces continuous casters and rolling equipment some of which are controlled by our information technology systems as well as electrical equipment such as transformers this equipment may on occasion be out of service as a result of unanticipated failures or other events including cyber attacks or system failures we have experienced and may in the future experience plant shutdowns or periods of reduced production as a result of such equipment failures or other events these disruptions could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and prospects 

we have incurred and may incur in the future costs to idle facilities idled facility carrying costs or increased costs to resume production at idled facilities 

our minnesota ironmaking operations are indefinitely idled and should we in the future resume production we would incur increased costs related to preparing for operation performing any required repairs and maintenance and training employees should economic or market conditions dictate we may in the future idle additional facilities which may require us to incur idling and carrying costs related to those facilities as well as further increased costs should production be resumed at any idled facility which could have an adverse effect on our financial results and results of operations 

governmental agencies may refuse to grant or renew some of our licenses and permits 

we must receive licenses air water and other permits and approvals from state and local governments to conduct certain of our operations or to develop or acquire new facilities governmental agencies sometimes resist the establishment of certain types of facilities in their communities including scrap metal collection and processing facilities there can be no assurance that future approvals licenses and permits will be granted or that we will be able to maintain and renew the approvals licenses and permits we currently hold failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and prospects

2017 overview 

﻿ 

our consolidated results for 2017 benefited from improved demand in the domestic steel market resulting in record steel shipments and sales compared to 2016  improved metal spreads from increased selling prices and a resulting 19 increase in operating income  underlying domestic steel consumption increased in 2017  as   the construction and energy markets continued to improve throughout the year  the heavy and offroad equipment and general industrial manufacturing markets improved   and the automotive markets remained strong  however steel imports rose again in 2017 most notably in structural and fabricated structural but also in cold roll and coated sheet supported by increased domestic steel mill utilization compared to 2016 our metals recycling operations were able to maintain consistent volume and realize increased ferrous metal spreads while also further reducing operating costs  resulting in improved operating income of almost 250  t he nonresidential construction market continued to strengthen resulting in record steel   fabrication sales and shipments  however increasing selling prices were outpaced by higher steel input costs resulting in compressed metal spread 

﻿ 

our 2017 performance both operationally and financially was one of steel dynamics inc best years we achieved numerous annual records while continuing to focus on and improve companywide safety

2016 overview 

﻿ 

our consolidated results for 2016 benefited from positive momentum in the sheet steel supply environment during the year  driving improved sheet steel volume and metal spreads as well as increased metal spread and operating cost reductions in our metals recycling operations underlying domestic steel consumption remained relatively consistent as the automotive markets were strong and construction improved throughout the year while heavy equipment agriculture and energy markets remained weak  sheet steel import levels declined during 2016 as compared to 2015 amidst the duties that were levied during 2016 pursuant to the trade cases filed with the u nited s tates international trade commission and customer inventory levels remained low compared to historical averages d omestic steel mill utilization rates were flat in 2016 compared to 2015 resulting in lower ferrous volumes in our metals recycling operations our metal spreads improved particularly in nonferrous materials and we benefited from continued operational cost containment efforts the nonresidential construction market for our steel fabrication operations was strong resulting in record shipments however average selling prices contracted outpacing declining steel input costs resulting in compressed metal spread during 2016 

in the fourth quarter of 2016 we recorded a 1273 million noncash asset impairment charge including amount s attributable to n oncontrolling interests of 131 million which reduced net income attributable to steel dynamics inc by  729 million for t he year ended december 31 2016  also during the fourth quarter of 2016 a 55 million omnisource goodwill impairment charge was recorded in conjunction with omnisource entering into a definitive sale agreement with a thirdparty pertaining to certain omnisource longlived assets classified and reported as held for sale as of december 31 2016 inventory and spare parts in the fourth quarter of 2015 we recorded a pretax noncash impairment charge related to goodwill  3413 million indefinitelived intangible assets  685 million and certain other assets  103 million associated with omnisource this impairment charge reduced 2015 operating income by 4285 million and net income and net income attributable to steel dynamics inc by 2687 million 

excluding the impact of the 1328 million and 4285 million in pretax noncash asset impairment charges in 2016 and 2015 respectively consolidated operating income increased 5051 million or 142 to 8608 million in 2016 compared to 3557 million in 2015 and net income attributable to steel dynamics inc increased  320 3 million or 232  to  4586 million or 187 per diluted share during 2016 co mpared with net income of 1383 million or 057 per diluted share during 2015  the impact of the 1328 million pretax noncash asset impairment charges including amounts attributable to noncontrolling i nterests of 131 million reduced 2016 net income attributable to steel dynamics inc by  764 million and our diluted earnings per share by 031 the impact of the 4285 million pretax noncash asset impairment charge reduced 2015 net income attributable to steel dynamics inc by 2687 million and our diluted earnings per share by 111

underlying domestic steel consumption increased in 2017  as   the construction and energy markets continued to improve throughout the year  the heavy and offroad equipment and general industrial manufacturing markets improved   and the automotive markets remained strong  as we continued to gain market share in this market particularly at our columbus flat roll division  with domestic steel consumption increasing in 2017 over 2016 steel imports particularly for long products but also cold roll and coated sheet rose over 15 from 2016 levels representing 27 of 2017 domestic consumption in spite of increased imports o ur steel mills utilization rate increased to 92 in 2017 as compared to 87 in 2016 with increases in both our sheet and long products steel utilization rates  our steel utilization rates continue to outpace our domestic competitors which averaged 74 during 2017 due to our diversified valueadded product offerings net sales for the steel operations increased 22 in 2017 when compared to 2016 due to a 4 increase in steel operations shipments combined with an increase of 110 per ton or 17 in average selling prices sheet steel average selling prices increased 19 in 2017 compared to 2016 while long products rose 10 

﻿ 

metallic raw materials used in our electric arc furnaces represent our single most significant steel manufacturing cost generally comprising approximately 60 of our steel operations’ manufacturing costs excluding the operations of the techs and vulcan which purchase rather than produce the steel they further process our metallic raw material cost per net ton consumed in our steel operations increased  73 or 33 compared to the same period in 2016 consistent with overall ferrous scrap market pricing 

﻿ 

 

operating income for the steel operations increased 19 to a record 11 billion in 2017 compared to 2016 due to an 8 increase in metal spread which we define as the difference between average selling prices and the cost of ferrous scrap consumed on higher selling prices coupled with increased steel shipments 

﻿ 

segment results 2016 vs 2015 

overall steel operations performance in 2016 compared to 2015 benefited from positive momentum throughout the year in the sheet steel supply environment as the excessively high levels of steel imports experienced in 2015 and 2014 declined approximately 15 in 2016 on a yearoveryear basis duties levied in 2016 pursuant to the trade case rulings from the u nited s tates international trade commission coupled with low customer inventories compared to historical levels precipitated higher domestic steel shipments and higher utilization for our steel mills our steel mill s utilization rate improved to 87  for 2016 as compared to 79  in 2015  with our sheet steel utilization rate improving to 99 in 2016 from 86 in 2015  the domestic steel demand outlook remained relatively unchanged throughout 2016 as automotive markets were strong and construction improved throughout the year while heavy equipment agriculture and energy markets remained challenged  overall steel selling prices improved during the last three quarters of 2016 from the significant decline that occurred throughout 2015 and early 2016 as sheet steel imports declined  net sales for the steel operations increased 8 in 2016 when compared to 2015 as an 11 increase in steel operations shipments more than offset a decrease of 15 per ton or 2 in average selling prices 

﻿ 

our metallic raw material cost per net ton consumed in our steel operations decreased 35 or 14  in 2016 compared to 2015 consistent with overall ferrous scrap market pricing 

﻿ 

operating income for the steel operations increased 130 to 9270 million in 2016 compared to 2015 due to a n 11 increase in steel shipments coupled with a 5  increase in overall steel operations metal spread e xpansion sheet steel metal spread expanded 15 while long prod ucts metal spread contracted 9 as domestic overcapacity and an aggressive competitive environment continued

the purchase of various steel products is the largest single cost of production for our steel fabrication operations generally representing approximately twothirds of the total cost of manufacturing the average cost of steel consumed increased by 15 in 2017 consistent with increased selling prices discussed in the steel operations results as compared to 2016 while average selling prices increased only 5 resulting in metal spread which we define as the difference between average selling prices and the cost of purchased steel contracting 5  operating income decreased 4 to 873 million in 2017 compared to 2016 as increased shipments were more than offset by metal spread contraction  

 

segment results 2016 vs 2015 

the nonresiden tial construction market   was strong during 2016 however decreased annual selling prices outpaced decreased overall steel input costs resulting in metal spread compression as a result of record shipments    which more than offset decreased selling prices n et sales for the steel fabrication operations increased 301 million o r 4 in 2016 compared to 2015 metal spread declined 10 in 2016 compared to 2015 as a 116 per ton or 8  decrease in average selling prices outpaced a 7 decrease in the average cost of steel consumed this resulted in a 22 decrease in operating income to 91 0 million in 2016 as compared to 1159 million in 2015

other operations consists of subsidiary operations that are below the quantitative thresholds required for reportable segments and primarily consist of our idled minnesota ironmaking operations and smaller joint ventures also included in “other” are certain unallocated corporate accounts such as the company’s senior secured credit facility senior notes certain other investments and certain profit sharing expenses  

﻿ 

during the fourth quarter of 2016 impairment indicators related primarily to mining resources and mesabi mining fixed assets within our minnesota ironmaking operations resulted in a noncash asset impairment charge of 1273 million including amounts attributable to noncontrolling interests of 131 million which reduced net income attributable to steel dynamics inc by 729 million for the year ended december 31 2016 

consolidated results 2017 vs 2016 

selling general and administrative expenses   selling general and administrative expenses of  3946 million during 2017 increased 6  from  3740 million during 2016  representing approximately 41  and 48  of net sales respectively  the increase in   2017 compared to 2016 is due most notably to increased performancebased incentive compensation  associated with our increased profitability  profit sharing of 913 million in 2017 increased 210 million or 28 over 2016 with our increased profitability  

interest expense net of capitalized interest during 2017  interest expense decreased  116 million to  1344 million when compared to 2016  the decrease in interest expense is due to lower interest rates on our senior notes outstanding in the fourth quarter of 2016 we called and repaid 4000 million of 6125 senior notes due 2019 with 5000 senior notes due 2026 also in the fourth quarter of 2016 we early paid off the remaining 2281 million of outstanding senior term loan debt in addition in the second half of 2017 we called and repaid our 3500 million of 6375 senior notes due 2022 with 4125 senior notes due 2025 

other expense income net net other income of 28 million in 2017 included 146 million of expense associated with call premium and other financing costs associated with the tender and call of the senior notes due 2022 which were more than offset by other income primarily interest net other expense of 178 million in 2016 included 165 million of expense associated with call premium and other financing costs associated with the tender and call of the senior notes due 2019  

income tax expense benefit   during 2017 our income tax expense was 1294 million at an effective income tax rate of 138 as compared to income tax expense of 2041 million resulting in an effective income tax rate of 362 during 2016 the lower effective tax rate in 2017 was due primarily to a onetime 1806 million net federal tax benefit resulting from our revaluation of deferred tax assets and liabilities in connection with the enacted tax cuts and jobs act of 2017 and discrete tax benefits related to valuation allowance reductions state tax refunds and equitybased compensation 

included in the balance of unrecognized tax benefits of 167 million at december 31 2017 are potential benefits of 125 million that if recognized would affect our effective tax rate we recognize interest and penalties related to our tax contingencies on a netoftax basis in income tax expense during the year ended december 31 2017 we recognized expense from the increase of interest expense of 85000 net of tax in addition to the unrecognized tax benefits noted above we had 48 million accrued for the payment of interest and penalties at december 31 2017 

we file income tax returns in the united states federal jurisdiction as well as income tax returns in various state jurisdictions we are subject to examination and proposed adjustments by the irs for years 2010 and thereafter at this time we do not believe there will be any significant examination adjustments that would result in a material change to our financial position results of operations or cash flows it is reasonably possible that the amount of unrecognized tax benefits could change in the next twelve months as a result of these federal income tax audits and state income tax audits based on the current audits in process the payment of taxes as a result of audit settlements could be in an amount from zero to 33 million by the end of 2018 with the exception of the 2010 and 2011 federal returns we are no longer subject to federal state and local income tax examinations by tax authorities for years ended before 2012 

consolidated results 2016 vs 2015 

selling general and administrative expenses   selling general and administrative expenses of  3740 million during 2016 increased 14  from  3288 million during 2015 representing approximately 48  and 43  of net sales respectively  the increase in 2016 compared to 2015 is due most notably to increased performancebased incentive compensation associated with our increased profitability  profit sharing of 713 million in 2016 increased 482 million over 2015 with our increased profitability  

 

interest expense net of capitalized interest during 2016 interest expense decreased 7 9 million to  1460 million when compared to 2015 the decrease in interest expense is due primarily to the call and prepayment of our 3500 million 7 5  8  senior notes due 2020 in the first quarter of 2015  

other expense income net during 2016 net other expense of 178 million included 165 million of expenses associated with call premium and other financing costs associated with the tender and call of the senior notes due 2019 net other expense of 154 million in 2015 includes 167 million of expenses associated with tender and call premium and other financing costs associated with the tender and call of the senior notes due 2020 

income tax expense benefit during 2016  our income tax expense was  2041 million at an effective income tax rate of 362  as compared to a benefit of  969 million resulting in an effective income tax rate of 400  during 2015  the lower effective tax rate in 2016 was due primarily to benefits from other permanent tax benefit items most notably the 2016 domestic manufacturing deduction available in years with taxable income 

liquidity and capital resources 

capital resources and long ‑term debt our business is capital intensive and requires substantial expenditures for among other things the purchase and maintenance of equipment used in our steel metals recycling and steel fabrication operations and to remain in compliance with environmental laws our shortterm and longterm liquidity needs arise primarily from working capital requirements capital expenditures principal and interest payments related to our outstanding indebtedness dividends to our shareholders and acquisitions we have met these liquidity requirements primarily with cash provided by operations and longterm borrowings and we also have availability under our revolver  our liquidity at december 31 2017 is as follows in thousands 

﻿ 



﻿ 

our total outstanding debt increased 221 million during 2017 due to additional revolving credit facility borrowings at one of our controlled subsidiaries our total longterm debt to capitalization ratio representing our longterm debt including current maturities divided by the sum of our longterm debt redeemable noncontrolling interests and our total stockholders’ equity decreased to 419 at december 31 2017 from 449 at december 31 2016 

﻿ 

in september 2017 we issued 3500 million of 4125 senior notes due 2025 the 2025 notes the proceeds of which along with available cash were used to fund the september 2017 tender to purchase at a redemption price of 103563 1829 million principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest to but not including the date of repurchase of our 6375 senior notes due 2022 the 2022 notes and the october 2017 call and repayment at a redemption price of 103188 of the 1671 million remaining outstanding principal amount of the 2022 notes plus accrued and unpaid interest to but not including the date of repayment 

﻿ 

our november 2014 senior secured credit facility facility which provides a 12 billion revolver matures november 2019 subject to certain conditions we have the opportunity to increase the revolver size by at least 7500 million the facility is guaranteed by certain of our subsidiaries and is secured by substantially all of our and our whollyowned subsidiaries’ receivables and inventories and by pledges of all shares of our whollyowned subsidiaries’ capital stock or other equity interests and intercompany debt held by us as collateral the revolver is available to fund working capital capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes the facility contains financial covenants and other covenants pertaining to our ability which may under certain circumstances be limited to make capital expenditures incur indebtedness permit liens on property enter into transactions with affiliates make restricted payments or investments enter into mergers acquisitions or consolidations conduct asset sales pay dividends or distributions or enter into other specified transactions and activities our ability to borrow funds within the terms of the revolver is dependent upon our continued compliance with the financial and other covenants at december 31 2017 we had 12 billion of availability on the revolver 119 million of outstanding letters of credit and other obligations which reduce availability and there were no borrowings outstanding 

﻿ 

the financial covenants under our facility state that we must maintain an interest coverage ratio of not less than 250100 our interest coverage ratio is calculated by dividing our lasttwelvemonths ltm consolidated adjusted ebitda earnings before interest taxes depreciation amortization and certain other noncash transactions as allowed in the facility by our ltm gross interest expense less amortization of financing fees in addition a net debt as defined in the facility to consolidated ltm adjusted ebitda net debt leverage ratio of not more than 500100 must be maintained if the net debt leverage ratio exceeds 350100 at any time our ability to make certain payments as defined in the facility which includes cash dividends to stockholders and share purchases among other things is limited at december 31 2017 our interest coverage ratio and net debt leverage ratio were 1075100 and 135100 respectively we were therefore in compliance with these covenants at december 31 2017 and we anticipate we will continue to be in compliance during the next twelve months  

﻿ 

 

working capital we generated cash flow from operations of 7396 million in 2017 operational working capital representing amounts invested in trade receivables and inventories less current liabilities other than income taxes payable and debt increased 2507 million to 1 6 billion at december 3 1  2017  increases in volumes pricing and profitability have resulted in increased accounts receivable and inventory which have been partially offset by increases in accounts payable and accrued expenses  operational working capital as a percentage of annual net sales is 163 at december 31 2017 as compared to 167 at december 31 2016 

capital investments during 2017 we invested 1649 million in property plant and equipment compared with 1982 million during 2016 our current estimated 2018 cash allocation plan includes the investment of approximately 250 million in capital expenditures in our existing and announced operations 

cash dividends as a reflection of continued confidence in our current and future cash flow generation ability and financial position we increased our quarterly cash dividend by 11 to 0155 per share in the first quarter 2017 from 0140 per share in 2016 resulting in declared cash dividends of 1482 million during 2017 compared to 1365 million during 2016 we paid cash dividends of 1456 million and 1358 million during 2017 and 2016 respectively our board of directors along with executive management approves the payment of dividends on a quarterly basis the determination to pay cash dividends in the future is at the discretion of our board of directors after taking into account various factors including our financial condition results of operations outstanding indebtedness current and anticipated cash needs and growth plans in addition the terms of our facility and the indentures relating to our senior notes may restrict the amount of cash dividends we can pay  

other during october 2016 our board of directors authorized a share repurchase program of up to 450 million of our common stock under the share repurchase program purchases will take place as and when we determine in open market or private transactions made based upon the market price of our common stock the nature of other investment opportunities or growth projects our cash flows from operations and general economic conditions the share repurchase program does not require us to acquire any specific number of shares and may be modified suspended extended or terminated by us at any time we acquired 74 million shares of our common stock for 2522 million during 2017 and 732000 shares for 250 million during 2016 leaving 1727 million available pursuant to this program see part ii other information item 5 m arket f or r egistrant’s c ommon e quity  r elated s tockholder m atters a nd i ssuer p urchases o f e quity s ecurities   for additional information 

our ability to meet our debt service obligations and reduce our total debt will depend upon our future performance which in turn will depend upon general economic financial and business conditions along with competition legislation and regulatory factors that are largely beyond our control in addition we cannot assure that our operating results cash flows access to credit markets and capital resources will be sufficient for repayment of our indebtedness in the future we believe that based upon current levels of operations and anticipated growth cash flows from operations together with other available sources of funds including if necessary borrowings under our revolver through its term will be adequate for the next twelve months for making required payments of principal and interest on our indebtedness funding working capital requirements and anticipated capital expenditures 

during 2017 we received benefits from state and local governments in the form of real estate and personal property tax abatements and credits of approximately 108 million based on our current abatements and incentive credits and utilizing our existing longlived asset structure we estimate the remaining annual benefit to our future operations to be approximately 107 million 94 million 36 million 35 million 34 million 30 million and 26 million during the years 2018 through 2024 respectively 

contractual obligations and other longterm liabilities 

﻿ 

we have the following minimum commitments under contractual obligations including purchase obligations as defined by the securities and exchange commission a “purchase obligation” is defined as an agreement to purchase goods or services that is enforceable and legally binding and that specifies all significant terms including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased fixed minimum or variable price provisions and the approximate timing of the transaction other longterm liabilities are defined as longterm liabilities that are reflected on our balance sheet under generally accepted accounting principles based on this definition the following table includes only those contracts which include fixed or minimum obligations it does not include normal purchases which are made in the ordinary course of business the following table provides aggregated information about outstanding contractual obligations and other longterm liabilities as of december 31 2017 in thousands

5 other commitments principally relate to deferred compensation plan obligations 

6 we expect to make cash outlays in the future related to our unrecognized tax benefits however due to the uncertainty of the timing we are unable to make reasonably reliable estimates regarding the period of cash settlement with the respective taxing authorities accordingly unrecognized tax benefits and related interest and penalties of 215 million as of december 31 2017 have been excluded from the contractual obligations table above refer to note 4   income taxes to the consolidated financial statements elsewhere in this report for additional information 

other matters 

inflation 

we believe that inflation has not had a material effect on our results of operations 

environmental and other contingencies 

we have incurred and in the future will continue to incur capital expenditures and operating expenses for matters relating to environmental control remediation monitoring and compliance during 2017 we incurred costs related to the monitoring and compliance of environmental matters in the amount of approximately 391 million and capital expenditures related to environmental compliance of approximately 29 million of the costs incurred during 2017 for monitoring and compliance approximately 77 were related to the normal transportation of certain types of waste produced in our steelmaking processes and other facilities in accordance with legal requirements we incurred combined environmental remediation costs of approximately 623000 at all of our facilities during 2017 we have an accrual of 29 million recorded for environmental remediation related to our metals recycling operations and 26 million related to minnesota ironmaking operations we believe apart from our dependence on environmental construction and operating permits for our existing and any future manufacturing facilities that compliance with current environmental laws and regulations is not likely to have a materially adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or liquidity  however e nvironmental laws and regulations evolve and change and we may become subject to more stringent environmental laws and regulations in the future such as the impact of united states government or various governmental agencies introducing regulatory changes in response to the potential of climate change 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

management’s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states we review the accounting policies we use in reporting our financial results on a regular basis the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent liabilities we evaluate the appropriateness of these estimations and judgments on an ongoing basis we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources results may differ from these estimates due to actual outcomes being different from those on which we based our assumptions we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 

revenue recognition and allowance for doubtful accounts except for our steel fabrication operations we recognize revenues from sales and the allowance for estimated returns and customer claims from these sales at the time title of the product transfers upon shipment provision is made for estimated product returns and customer claims based on historical experience if the historical data used in our estimates does not reflect future returns and claims trends additional provision may be necessary our steel fabrication operations recognizes revenues using a percentage of completion methodology based on steel tons used on completed units to date as a percentage of estimated total steel tons required by each contract the allowance for doubtful accounts for all operating segments is based on our best estimate of probable credit losses along with historical experience which estimates may or may not prove accurate 

we are exposed to credit risk in the event of nonpayment by our customers which in steel operations are principally intermediate steel processors and service centers that sell our products to numerous industry sectors including the construction automotive manufacturing transportation heavy and agriculture equipment and pipe and tube including octg markets our metals recycling operations sell ferrous scrap to 

 

steel mills and foundries and nonferrous scrap such as copper brass aluminum and stainless steel to among others ingot manufacturers copper refineries and mills smelters and specialty mills our steel fabrication operations sell fabricated steel joists and deck primarily to the nonresidential construction market we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments based on known credit risks historical loss experience and current economic conditions affecting our customers we mitigate our exposure to credit risk which we generally extend initially on an unsecured basis by performing ongoing credit evaluations and taking further action when necessary such as requiring letters of credit or other security interests to support the customer receivable if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate resulting in the impairment of their ability to make payments additional allowance may be required 

inventories we record inventories at lower of cost or net realizable value cost is determined using a weighted average cost method for raw materials and supplies and on a firstin firstout basis for other inventory we record amounts required if any to reduce the carrying value of inventory to its net realizable value as a charge to cost of goods sold if product selling prices were to decline in future periods further writedown of inventory could result specifically raw material inventory such as scrap purchased during periods of peak market pricing 

impairments of longlived tangible and definite ‑lived intangible assets we review longlived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of such assets may not be fully recoverable impairment losses are recorded on longlived assets used in operations when indicators of impairment are present and the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than the assets’ carrying amounts the impairment loss is measured by comparing the fair value of the asset to its carrying amount we consider various factors and determine whether an impairment test is necessary including by way of examples a significant and prolonged deterioration in operating results andor projected cash flows significant changes in the extent or manner in which an asset is used technological advances with respect to assets which would potentially render them obsolete our strategy and capital planning and the economic climate in markets to be served when determining future cash flows and if necessary fair value we must make judgments as to the expected utilization of assets and estimated future cash flows related to those assets we consider historical and anticipated future results general economic and market conditions the impact of planned business and operational strategies and all other available information at the time the estimates are made those estimates and judgments may or may not ultimately prove accurate 

a longlived asset is classified as held for sale upon meeting specified criteria related to ability and intent to sell an asset classified as held for sale is measured at the lower of its carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell as of december 31 2017 and 2016 the company reported 87 million and 293 million  respectively of assets held for sale within other current assets in our consolidated balance sheet an impairment loss is recognized for any initial or subsequent writedown of the asset held for sale to its fair value less cost to sell for assets determined to be classified as held for sale in the year ended december 31 2017 and 2016 the asset carry ing amounts approximated their fair value less cost to sell  the company determined fair value using level 3 fair value inputs as provided for under asc 820 consisting of information provided by brokers and other external sources along with management’s own assumptions 

﻿ 

significant events occurred during the fourth quarter of 2016 that represented impairment indicators related primarily to mining resources and mesabi mining fixed assets within our minnesota ironmaking operations the company therefore undertook a fourth quarter 2016 assessment of the recoverability of the carrying amounts of primarily our mining resources and mesabi mining operation’s fixed assets with the company’s outlook at the time of this 2016 assessment regarding future cash flows the company concluded that the carrying amounts of the fixed assets were no longer fully recoverable and they were in fact impaired this 2016 assessment resulted in a noncash asset impairment charge of 1273 million including amounts attributable to noncontrolling interests of 131 million which reduced net income attributable to steel dynamics inc by 729 million for the year ended december 31 2016 the carrying values of the impaired assets were adjusted to their estimated fair values at that time as determined primarily on the cost approach as well as expected future discounted cash flows an income approach using level 3 fair value inputs as provided for under asc 820 

goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets 

our goodwill relates to various business combinations and is allocated to the following reporting units at december 31 in thousands 

﻿ 

﻿ 



﻿ 

at least once annually as of october 1 or when indicators of impairment exist the company performs an impairment test for goodwill goodwill is allocated to various reporting units which are generally one level below the company’s operating segments we utilize a twostepped approach to evaluate goodwill impairment the first step of the test determines if there is potential goodwill impairment in this step the company compares the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying amount which includes goodwill the fair value of the reporting unit is determined by 

 

using an estimate of future cash flows utilizing a riskadjusted discount rate to calculate the net present value of future cash flows income approach and by using a market approach based upon an analysis of valuation metrics of comparable peer companies level 3 inputs as provided for under asc 820 if the fair value exceeds the carrying value there is no impairment if the carrying amount exceeds the fair value the company performs the second step of the test which measures the amount of impairment loss to be recorded in the second step the company compares the carrying amount of the goodwill to the implied fair value of the goodwill based on the net fair value of the recognized and unrecognized assets and liabilities of the reporting unit to which it is allocated if the implied fair value is less than the carrying value an impairment loss is recorded to the extent that the fair value of the goodwill is less than its carrying value 

key assumptions used to determine the estimated fair value of each reporting unit under the discounted cash flows method income approach include a expected cash flows for the fiveyear period following the testing date including market share sales volumes and prices costs to produce and estimated capital needs b an estimated terminal value using a terminal year growth rate determined based on the growth prospects of the reporting unit and c a riskadjusted discount rate based on management’s best estimate of market participants’ aftertax weighted average cost of capital and market risk premiums key assumptions used to determine the estimated fair value of each reporting unit under the market approach include the expected revenues and cash flows in the next year we consider historical and anticipated future results general economic and market conditions the impact of planned business and operational strategies and all available information at the time the fair values of its reporting units are estimated those estimates and judgments may or may not ultimately prove accurate 

goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets acquired in past transactions are naturally more susceptible to impairment primarily due to the fact that they are recorded at fair value based on operating plans and economic conditions at the time of acquisition consequently if operating results andor economic conditions deteriorate after an acquisition it could result in the impairment of the acquired assets a deterioration of economic conditions may not only negatively impact the estimated operating cash flows used in our cash flow models but may also negatively impact other assumptions used in our analyses including but not limited to the estimated cost of capital andor discount rates additionally we are required to ensure that assumptions used to determine fair value in our analyses are consistent with the assumptions a hypothetical marketplace participant would use as a result the cost of capital andor discount rates used in our analyses may increase or decrease based on market conditions and trends regardless of whether our actual cost of capital has changed therefore we may recognize an impairment of an intangible asset or assets in spite of realizing actual cash flows that are approximately equal to or greater than our previously forecasted amounts 

at least once annually as of october 1 or when indicators of impairment exist we test indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment through the comparison of the fair value of the specific intangible asset with its carrying amount the fair value of the intangible asset is determined by using an estimate of future cash flows attributable to the asset and a riskadjusted discount rate to compute a net present value of future cash flows income approach if the fair value is less than the carrying value an impairment loss is recorded in an amount equal to the excess in carrying value 

our fourth quarter 2017 annual goodwill impairment analyses did not result in any impairment charges management does not believe that it is reasonably likely that our reporting units will fail step one of a goodwill impairment test in the near term as the determined fair value of the reporting units with goodwill exceeded their carrying value by more than an insignificant amount we will continue to monitor operating results within all reporting units throughout the upcoming year to determine if events and circumstances warrant interim impairment testing otherwise all reporting units will again be subject to the required annual impairment test during the fourth quarter of 2018 changes in judgments and estimates underlying our analysis of goodwill for possible impairment including expected future operating cash flows and discount rate could decrease the estimated fair value of our reporting units in the future and could result in an impairment of goodwill 

﻿ 

in 2016 a 55 million omnisource goodwill impairment charge was recorded in conjunction with omnisource entering into a definitive sale agreement with a thirdparty pertaining to certain omnisource longlived assets classified and reported as held for sale as of december 31 2016 inventory and spare parts as provided under asc 350 

during our 2015 annual goodwill and indefinitelived intangible asset impairment assessment we determined that the fair value of omnisource was less than its carrying value and upon the completion of the impairment analysis that the goodwill and trade name indefinitelived assets were impaired the omnisource goodwill and trade name indefinitelived intangible assets were written down to their respective fair values resulting in pretax noncash asset impairment charges of 3413 million and 685 million respectively that are reflected in asset impairment charges in the consolidated statement of operations for the year ended december 31 2015 within the metals recycling operations 

income taxes we are required to estimate our income taxes as a part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements this requires us to estimate our actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatments of items for tax and accounting purposes these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities which are included within our consolidated balance sheet we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely we must establish a valuation allowance we also establish reserves to reduce some or all of the tax benefit of any of our tax positions at the time we determine that the positions become uncertain we adjust these reserves including any impact on the related interest and penalties in light of changing facts and circumstances such as the progress of a tax audit a number of years may elapse before a particular matter for which we have established a reserve is audited by a taxing authority and finally resolved the number of years with open tax audits varies depending on the tax jurisdiction the tax benefit that has been previously reserved because of a failure to meet the more likely than not recognition threshold would be recognized in our income tax expense in the first interim period when the uncertainty disappears settlement of any particular issue would usually require the use of cash 

 




 item 7 a  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

market risk 

in the normal course of business we are exposed to interest rate changes our objectives in managing fluctuations in interest rates are to limit the impact of these rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower overall borrowing costs to achieve these objectives we may use interest rate swaps to manage net exposure to interest rate changes related to our portfolio of borrowings   

the following table represents the principal cash repayments and related weighted ‑average interest rates by maturity date for our longterm debt as of december 31 2017 in thousands 

﻿ 



﻿ 

commodity risk 

in the normal course of business we are exposed to the market risk and price fluctuations related to the sale of our products and to the purchase of raw materials used in our operations such as metallic raw materials electricity natural gas and its transportation services fuel air products zinc  and electrodes  our risk strategy associated with product sales has generally been to obtain competitive prices for our products and to allow operating results to reflect market price movements dictated by supply and demand 

our risk strategy associated with the purchase of raw materials utilized within our operations has generally been to make some commitments with suppliers relating to future expected requirements for some commodities such as electricity natural gas and its transportation services fuel air products zinc and electrodes certain of these commitments contain provisions which require us to “take or pay” for specified quantities without regard to actual usage for periods of up to 5 years for physical commodity requirements and commodity transportation requirements and for up to 11 years for air products our commitments for these arrangements with “take or pay” or other similar commitment provisions for the years ending december 31 are as follows in thousands 

﻿ 

﻿ 



﻿ 

we utilized such “take or pay” requirements during the past three years under these contracts except for certain air products at our minnesota ironmaking operations which have been idle since may 2015 we believe that production requirements will be such that consumption of the products or services purchased under these commitments will occur in the normal production process other than certain air products related to our minnesota ironmaking operations during the idle period we also purchase electricity consumed at our butler flat roll division pursuant to a contract which extends through december 201 8 which establishes an agreed fixedrate energy charge per millkwh consumed for each year through the expiration of the agreement 

﻿ 

in our metals recycling operations we have certain fixed price contracts with various customers and suppliers for future delivery of nonferrous metals our risk strategy has been to enter into base metal financial contracts with the goal to protect the profit margin within certain parameters that was contemplated when we entered into the transaction with the customer or vendor at december 31 2017  we had a cumulative unrealized loss associated with these financial contracts of 77 million substantially all of which have settlement dates in 2018 we believe the customer contracts associated with the financial contracts will be fully consummated

we have three reporting segments steel operations metals recycling operations and steel fabrication operations refer to notes 1 and 13 in the notes to consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 of this form 10k for additional segment information 

﻿ 

﻿ 



﻿ 

steel operations consist of our six electric arc furnace steel mills producing steel from ferrous scrap and scrap substitutes utilizing continuous casting automated rolling mills and eleven downstream steel coating lines and several processing lines and idi our liquid pig iron production facility that supplies solely the butler flat roll division our steel operations sell directly to endusers steel fabricators and service centers these products are used in numerous industry sectors including the construction automotive manufacturing transportation heavy and agriculture equipment and pipe and tube including octg markets our steel operations accounted for 72 69 and 63 of our consolidated net sales in 2016 2015 and 2014 respectively we are predominantly a domestic steel company with only 4 5 and 4 of our revenues generated from exported sales during 2016  2015  and 2014  respectively 

our steel operations consist primarily of steelmaking and coating operations the following chart summarizes the locations and the current estimated production capacities of our facilities 

﻿ 



﻿ 

﻿ 

note steelmaking capacities represent manufacturing capabilities based on mill configuration and related employee support these capacities do not represent expected volumes in a given year in addition estimates of mill capacity are highly dependent on the specific product mix manufactured each of our mills can and do roll many different types and sizes of products therefore our capacity estimates assume a typical product mix 

﻿ 

 the techs galvanizing capacity is included in “steelmaking capacity” to represent the capability to utilize sheet steel substrate to produce galvanized sheet steel at their facilities 

 vulcan threaded products bar finishing capacity is included in “steelmaking capacity’ to represent the capability to utilize steel longproduct substrate to produce threaded rod and cold draw and heat treat bar products at their facility

steel of west virginia primarily sells beams channels and specialty steel sections and frequently performs fabrication and finishing operations on its products such as cutting to length additional straightening hole punching shot blasting welding and coating through this additional finishing we create custom finished products that are generally placed directly into our customers’ assembly operations  we produced 289000  295000  and 294000 tons of various merchant and structural steel products at steel of west virginia during 2016  2015  and 2014 respectively 

 

customers the principal customers for our structural steel products are steel service centers steel fabricators and various manufacturers service centers though not the ultimate enduser provide valuable mill distribution functions to the fabricators and manufacturers including small quantity sales repackaging cutting preliminary processing and warehousing the steel rail marketplace in the united states canada and mexico is specialized and defined with seven class i railroads and a large distribution network 

sbq products are principally consumed by cold finishers forgers intermediate processors oem manufacturers steel service centers and distributors as well as vulcan threaded products our mbq products are sold primarily to steel service centers as well as rebar distributors joist producers and oems some of the excess steel billet production at the roanoke bar division is sold to mills without sufficient melting capacities including our steel of west virginia facility our steel fabrication operations also purchase angles from roanoke bar division steel of west virginia’s customers are primarily oems producing truck trailers industrial lift trucks merchant products guardrail posts manufactured housing mining and offhighway construction equipment steel of west virginia’s flexible manufacturing capabilities enable us to meet demand for a variety of customordered and designed products many of these products are produced in small quantities for low volume enduses resulting in a wide variety of customers the largest of which are in the truck trailer and industrial lift truck industries 

competition the markets in which we conduct business are highly competitive with an abundance of competition in the carbon steel industry from north american and foreign integrated and minimill steelmaking and processing operations we compete in numerous industry sections most significantly tied to the construction automotive and other manufacturing sectors in many applications within these industry sections steel competes with other materials such as aluminum cement composites plastics carbon fiber glass and wood some of our products are commodities subject to their own cyclical fluctuations in supply and demand however we are focused on providing a broader range of diversified valueadded products that deemphasize commodity steel the primary competitive influences on products we sell are price quality and valueadded services 

global steelmaking capacity exceeds global consumption of steel products such excess capacity sometimes results in steel manufacturers in certain countries exporting steel at prices that are lower than prevailing domestic prices and sometimes at or below their cost to produce excessive imports of steel in the united states such as in 2015 and 2014 intensifies price competition on the domestic steel industry which negatively affects our ability to increase our selling prices and realize higher margins and profitability 

iron dynamics 

idi produces liquid pig iron and hot briquetted iron hbi that serves as a substitute for a portion of the metallic raw material mix that goes directly into our butler flat roll division electric arc furnaces to produce steel idi’s primary focus is to maximize liquid pig iron production due to the inherent economic benefits achieved at the steel mill when the material is used in the steelmaking process such as reduced energy cost reduced materials cost and quicker melting cycles during 2016 and 2015 respectively idi produced 255000 and 245000 metric tons of which 98 was liquid pig iron we have used and plan to continue to use all of the facility’s output internally

the metals recycling operations consists solely of omnisource and includes both ferrous and nonferrous scrap metal processing transportation marketing brokerage and consulting services strategically located primarily in close proximity to our steel mills and other enduser scrap consumers throughout the eastern half of the united states in addition omnisource designs installs and manages customized scrap management programs for industrial manufacturing companies at over 700 locations throughout north america our metals recycling operations accounted for 15 19 and 25 of our consolidated net sales in 2016 2015 and 2014 respectively our steel mills utilize a portion of the ferrous scrap processed through omnisource as raw material in our steelmaking operations and the remainder is sold to other consumers such as other steel manufacturers and foundries this strategic symbiotic relationship with our own steelmaking operations provides valuable pullthrough demand to omnisource’s ferrous scrap operations in 2016 2015 and 2014 omnisource supplied our steel mills with approximately 36 37 and 44 respectively  of the tons of their ferrous raw material requirements representing approximately 61 54 and 48 respectively  of omnisource’s 2016 2015 and 2014 ferrous shipped tons 

omnisource sold approximately 51 million gross tons of ferrous material in 2016 and 2015 and 56 million gross tons in 2014  and approximately 11 billion pounds of nonferrous material during 2016 and 2015  and 12 billion pounds in 2014 approximately 7 8 and 7 of omnisource’s revenues were from export sales of primarily nonferrous materials during 2016 2015 and 2014 respectively 

we sell various grades of processed ferrous scrap primarily to steel mills and foundries ferrous scrap metal is the primary raw material for electric arc furnaces such as our steel mills in addition we sell various grades of nonferrous metals such as copper brass aluminum and stainless steel to aluminum steel and ingot manufacturers brass and bronze ingot makers copper refineries and mills smelters specialty mills alloy manufacturers and other consumers 

﻿ 

﻿ 

﻿ 

 

we purchase ferrous and nonferrous scrap metals processed and unprocessed in a variety of forms for our metals recycling facilities 

ferrous scrap comes from two primary sources 





nonferrous scrap comes from three primary sources 







we do not purchase a significant amount of scrap metal from a single source or from a limited number of major sources market demand and the composition quality size weight and location of the materials are the primary factors that determine prices 

products our metals recycling operations primarily involve the purchase processing and resale of ferrous and nonferrous scrap metals into reusable forms and grades we process an array of ferrous products through a variety of methods including sorting shredding shearing cutting torching baling briquetting and breaking our major ferrous products include heavy melting steel busheling bundled scrap shredded scrap and other scrap metal products such as steel turnings and cast iron these products vary in properties or attributes related to cleanness size of individual pieces and residual alloys the necessary characteristics of the ferrous products are determined by the specific needs and requirements of the consumer and affect the individual product’s relative value we process various grades of nonferrous products including aluminum brass copper stainless steel and other nonferrous metals additionally we provide transportation logistics truck rail and river barge management services marketing brokerage and consulting services related to the scrap industry 

customers we sell various grades of processed ferrous scrap to endusers such as electric arc furnace steel mills integrated steelmakers foundries secondary smelters and metal brokers who aggregate materials for other large users ferrous scrap metal is the primary raw material for electric arc furnaces such as our steel mills most of our ferrous scrap customers purchase processed scrap through negotiated spot sales contracts which establish a quantity purchase for the month the price we charge for ferrous scrap depends upon market demand and pricing transportation costs as well as the quality and grade of the scrap we sell various grades of processed nonferrous scrap to endusers such as aluminum sheet and ingot manufacturers brass and bronze ingot makers copper refineries mills smelters specialty steelmakers alloy manufacturers wire and cable producers utilities and telephone networks the price we charge for nonferrous scrap depends upon market demand and pricing transportation costs as well as the quality and grade of the scrap 

competition scrap is a global commodity influenced by conditions in a number of industrialized and emerging markets throughout asia europe and north america the markets for scrap metals are highly competitive both in the purchase of raw or unprocessed scrap and the sale of processed scrap with regard to the purchase of raw scrap we compete with numerous independent recyclers as well as smaller scrap companies engaged only in collecting obsolete scrap in many cases we also purchase unprocessed scrap metal from smaller scrap dealers and other processors successful procurement of materials is determined primarily by the price offered by the purchaser for the raw scrap and the proximity of our processing facility to the source of the raw scrap both ferrous and nonferrous scrap sells as a commodity in both domestic and international markets which are affected sometimes significantly by relative economic conditions currency fluctuations and the availability and cost of transportation competition for sales of processed scrap is based primarily on the price quality and location of the scrap metals as well as the level of service provided in terms of reliability and timing of delivery 

we also face potential competition for sales of processed scrap from other producers of steel products such as electric arc furnace and integrated steel mills some of which are also vertically integrated in the scrap metals recycling business in addition other steel mills may compete with us in attempting to secure scrap supply through direct purchasing from our scrap suppliers scrap metal processors also face competition from substitutes for prepared ferrous scrap such as prereduced iron pellets hbi pig iron direct reduced iron dri and other forms of processed iron the availability and relative prices of substitutes for ferrous scrap could result in a decreased demand for processed ferrous scrap and could result in lower prices andor lower demand for our scrap products 

the industry is highly fragmented with many smaller familyowned companies many regional scrap companies along with a number of national and global companies each of which has multiple locations in areas in which omnisource also operates no single scrap metals recycler has a significant market share in the domestic market

sources availability and cost of steel and other operations’ raw materials 

scrap metals the principal raw material of our steel operations is scrap metal derived from among other sources “home scrap” generated internally at steel mills themselves industrial scrap generated as a byproduct of manufacturing and “obsolete” scrap recycled from endoflife automobiles appliances railroad cars and railroad track materials agricultural machinery and demolition scrap from obsolete structures containers and machines 

ferrous scrap typically comprises more than 80 of the metallic melt mix in electric arc furnace steelmaking in contrast to integrated mill steelmaking where the proportion of scrap has traditionally been approximately 25 to 35 depending upon the scrap substitute material that may be available from time to time and the relative cost of such material the percentage of scrap used in our steelmaking operations could be increased or reduced in our metallic melt mix 

many variables can impact ferrous scrap prices all of which reflect the pushes and pulls of the supply demand equation these factors include the level of domestic steel production high quality lowresidual scrap is a byproduct of steel manufacturing activity the level of exports of scrap from the united states and the amount of obsolete scrap production generally as domestic steel demand increases so does scrap demand and resulting scrap prices the reverse is also normally but not always true with scrap prices following steel prices downward when supply exceeds demand in 2015 domestic steel mill utilization and steel pricing was negatively impacted by record levels of steel imports resulting in lower demand for scrap forcing ferrous pricing downward throughout the year these excess sheet steel imports declined during 2016 with duties levied pursuant to the trade case rulings from the united states international trade commission resulting in increased domestic steel mill and more so our own steel mill utilization 

the price of ferrous scrap as a commodity has tended to be volatile rising and falling with supply and not always in lock step with or in proportion to the market price of steel in addition domestic ferrous scrap prices generally have a strong correlation and spread to global pig iron pricing scrap prices declined sharply in 2015 due to domestic scrap competition the strong united states dollar tempering scrap exports lower steel mill utilization rates resulting from excessive steel imports and decreasing global pig iron prices in 2016 scrap prices improved as mill utilization rates increased with the lower level of steel imports when scrap prices greatly accelerate this challenges one of the principal elements of an electric arc furnace based steel mill’s traditional lower cost structure—the cost of its metallic raw material

﻿ 

iron units   in addition to scrap dri  hbi pig iron and iron nuggets are used in our electric arc furnace steel mill production during 2016  2015 and 2014  we consumed 99 million  88 million and 76 million tons respectively of metallic materials in our steelmaking furnaces of which iron units other than scrap represented approximately 14 12 and 9 of the tons in 2016    2015 and 2014 respectively of these iron substitute units consumed our idi operations supplies 100 of its production to the butler flat roll division mill representing 65 66 and 62 of their iron units in 2016  2015 and 2014 respectively  

energy resources 

electricity     electricity is a significant input required in the electric arc furnaces in our steelmaking operations excluding the techs and vulcan representing 7 6 and 5 of steel production costs of goods sold in 2016  2015 and 2014 respectively we have entered into a fixed price interruptible electricity supply agreement that extends through december 31 2017 for the butler flat roll division the contract allows our supplier to interrupt service in the event of an emergency or in response to various market conditions columbus flat roll division roanoke bar division and steel of west virginia have each entered into fixed price contracts while our engineered bar products division has a combination of fixed pricing and market pricing for the various components of the electrical services demand charge energy charge riders etc our structural and rail division purchases electricity at current market prices and through forward contracts at fixed prices  

patents and trademarks 

we currently do not own any material patents or patent applications for technologies that are in use in our production processes we have seven major registered trademarks as follows 















research and development 

our research and development activities have consisted of efforts to expand develop and improve our products and operating processes and our efforts to develop and improve alternative ironmaking technologies through idi and prior to idling our minnesota ironmaking operations most of these research and development efforts have been conducted inhouse by our employees 

environmental matters 

our operations are subject to substantial and evolving local state and federal environmental health and safety laws and regulations concerning among other things emissions to the air discharges to surface and ground water and to sewer systems and the generation handling storage transportation treatment and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes our manufacturing operations are dependent upon permits regulating discharges into the air or into the water or the use and handling of byproducts in order to operate our facilities we dedicate considerable resources aimed at achieving compliance with federal and state laws concerning the environment while we do not currently believe that our future compliance efforts with such provisions will have a material adverse effect on our results of operations cash flows or financial condition this is subject to change in the evolving regulatory environment in which we operate 

since the level of enforcement of environmental laws and regulations or the nature of those laws that may be enacted from time to time are subject to changing social or political pressures our environmental capital expenditures and costs for environmental compliance may increase in the future in addition due to the possibility of unanticipated regulatory or other developments the amount and timing of future environmental expenditures may vary substantially from those currently anticipated the cost of current and future environmental compliance may also place united states steel producers at a competitive disadvantage with respect to foreign steel producers which may not be required to undertake equivalent costs in their operations 

 

pursuant to the resource conservation and recovery act or rcra which governs the treatment handling and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes the united states environmental protection agency or united states epa and authorized state environmental agencies may conduct inspections to identify areas where there may have been releases of solid or hazardous constituents into the environment and require the facilities to take corrective action to remediate any such releases rcra also allows citizens to bring certain suits against regulated facilities for potential damages and cleanup our steelmaking and certain other facilities generate wastes subject to rcra our manufacturing operations produce various byproducts some of which for example electric arc furnace or eaf dust are categorized as solid or hazardous waste requiring special handling for disposal or for the recovery of metallics we collect such byproducts in pollution controlled equipment such as baghouses and either recycle or dispose of these byproducts while we cannot predict the future actions of the regulators or other interested parties the potential exists for required corrective action at these facilities the costs of which could be substantial 

under the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act “cercla” or “superfund” the united states epa and in some instances private parties have the authority to impose joint and several liability for the remediation of contaminated properties upon generators of waste current and former site owners and operators transporters and other potentially responsible parties regardless of fault or the legality of the original disposal activity many states have statutes and regulatory authorities similar to cercla and to the united states epa we have a number of material handling agreements with various contractors to properly dispose of or recycle our electric arc furnace dust and certain other byproducts of our operations however we cannot assure that even if there has been no fault by us we may not still be cited as a waste generator by reason of an environmental cleanup at a site to which our byproducts were transported 

the clean water act and similar state laws apply to aspects of our operations and impose regulatory burdens related to the discharge of wastewater storm water and dredged or fill material united states epa states and in certain instances private parties have the ability to bring suit alleging violations and seeking penalties and damages the clean water act’s provisions can require new or expanded water treatment investments to be made and can limit or even prohibit certain current or planned activities at our operations 

the clean air act and analogous state laws require many of our facilities to obtain and maintain air permits in order to operate air permits can impose new or expanded obligations to limit or prevent current or future emissions and to add costly pollution control equipment enforcement can be brought by the united states epa the states and in certain instances private parties and can result in penalties and injunctive relief 

in addition there are a number of other environmental health and safety laws and regulations that apply to our facilities and may affect our operations by way of example and not of limitation certain portions of the federal toxic substances control act oil pollution act safe drinking water act and emergency planning and community righttoknow act as well as state and local laws and regulations implemented by the regulatory agencies apply to aspects of our facilities’ operations many of these laws allow both the governments and citizens to bring certain suits against regulated facilities for alleged environmental violations finally any steelmaking and metals recycling company could be subject to certain toxic tort suits brought by citizens or other third parties alleging causes of action such as nuisance negligence trespass infliction of emotional distress or other claims alleging personal injury or property damage 

employees 

we emphasize decentralized decision making and responsibility and have established performancebased incentive compensation programs specifically designed to enhance productivity improve profitability control costs and foster innovation our work force consisted of approximately 7695 full time employees at december 31 2016 of which approximately 9 were represented by collective bargaining agreements the largest group of unionized employees is at steel of west virginia the remaining unionized employees are located in five different omnisource metals recycling locations each of which has its own agreement we believe that our relationship with our employees is good

 item 1 a  risk factors 

  many factors could have an effect on our financial condition cash flows and results of operations we are subject to various risks resulting from changing economic environmental political industry business and financial conditions the factors described below represent our principal risks  

risks related to our industry 

our industry is affected by domestic and global economic factors including periods of slower than anticipated economic growth and the risk of a new recession 

our financial results are substantially dependent not only upon overall economic conditions in the united states and globally including europe and in asia but also as they may affect one or more of the industries upon which we depend for the sale of our products recent global actions such as the new united states political administration the united kingdom referendum to exit the european union and the possibility of domestic and international trade restrictions could result in changing economic conditions in the united states and globally the effects of which are not known at this time additionally periods of slower than anticipated economic growth such as the slow and uneven recovery from the recent recession could reduce customer confidence and adversely affect demand for our products and further adversely affect our business metals industries have historically been vulnerable to significant declines in consumption and product pricing during periods of economic downturn or continued uncertainty including the pace of domestic nonresidential construction activity 

our business is also dependent upon certain industries such as construction automotive manufacturing transportation heavy and agriculture equipment and pipe and tube including octg markets and these industries are also cyclical in nature therefore these industries may experience their own fluctuations in demand for our products based on such things as economic conditions energy prices consumer demand and infrastructure funding decisions by governments many of these factors are beyond our control as a result of volatility in our industry or in the industries we serve we may have difficulty increasing or maintaining our level of sales or profitability if our industry or the industries we serve were to suffer a downturn then our business may be adversely affected 

our level of production and our sales and earnings are subject to significant fluctuations as a result of the cyclical nature of the steel industry and some of the industries we serve 

the steel manufacturing business is cyclical in nature and the selling price of the steel we make may fluctuate significantly due to many factors beyond our control furthermore a number of our products are commodities subject to their own cyclical fluctuations in supply and demand in both metal consuming and metal generating industries including the construction and manufacturing industries the timing magnitude and duration of these cycles and the resulting price fluctuations are difficult to predict the sale of our manufactured steel products is directly affected by demand for our products in other cyclical industries such as construction automotive manufacturing transportation heavy and agriculture equipment and pipe and tube including octg markets economic difficulties stagnant global economies supplydemand imbalances and currency fluctuations in the united states or globally could decrease the demand for our products or increase the amount of imports of steel into the united states which could decrease our sales margins and profitability 

the scrap metal recycling industry has historically been and is expected to remain highly cyclical and this could have a material adverse effect on our metals recycling operations results 

scrap metal prices have become increasingly volatile and operating results within the metals recycling industry in general have historically been cyclical and are expected to remain highly cyclical in nature similarly but not necessarily paralleling the price fluctuations in the steel business the purchase prices for automobile bodies and various other grades of obsolete and industrial scrap as well as the selling prices for processed and recycled scrap metals we utilize in our own manufacturing process or which we resell to others through our metals recycling operations are also highly volatile during periods of excess domestic supply or increased imports scrap metal prices may become or remain depressed and adversely affect the sales profitability and margins of our scrap business as a metals recycler we may attempt to respond to changing recycled metal selling prices by adjusting the scrap metal purchase prices we pay to others but our ability to do this may be limited by competitive or other factors during periods of low scrap prices when inbound scrap flow may slow considerably as scrap generators hold on to their scrap in hopes of getting higher prices later as such a prolonged period of low scrap prices could reduce our ability to obtain process and sell recycled materials and this could adversely affect our metals recycling operations results conversely periodic increased foreign demand for scrap can result in an outflow of available domestic scrap as well as resulting higher scrap prices domestically that cannot always be passed on to domestic scrap consumers thereby further reducing available domestic scrap flows and scrap margins all of which could adversely affect our sales and profitability of our scrap business additionally during periods of high demand and resulting higher scrap prices ferrous scrap consumers may seek and develop ferrous scrap alternatives including pig iron and dri the availability and pricing of these scrap alternatives in the domestic market may have a longer term impact on scrap pricing particularly in prime grades which could adversely affect our sales profitability and margins 

global steelmaking overcapacity and imports of steel into the united states have adversely affected and may again adversely affect united states steel prices which could impact our sales margins and profitability 

global steelmaking capacity currently exceeds global consumption of steel products such excess capacity sometimes results in steel manufacturers in certain countries exporting steel at prices that are lower than prevailing domestic prices and sometimes at or below their cost of 

 

production excessive imports of steel into the united states such as in recent years have exerted and may continue to exert downward pressure on united states steel prices which negatively affects our ability to increase our sales margins and profitability furthermore anticipated additional domestic steel capacity could increase this global overcapacity this in turn may also adversely impact domestic demand for ferrous scrap and our ferrous metallics margins united states steel producers compete with many foreign producers including those in china vietnam and other asian and european countries competition from foreign producers is typically strong and is periodically exacerbated by weakening of the economies of certain foreign steelmaking countries a higher volume of steel exports to the united states tend to occur at depressed prices when steel producing countries experience periods of economic difficulty decreased demand for steel products or excess capacity 

the global steelmaking overcapacity is exacerbated by chinese steel production capacity that far exceeds that country’s current demand and has made china a major global exporter of steel this combination of a slowdown in chinas economic growth and steel consumption coupled with its own expansion of steelmaking capacity has resulted in a weakening of global steel pricing moreover many asian and european steel producers whose steel output previously fed chinas steel import needs could redirect their steel into the united states market through increased steel imports causing a further erosion of margins or negatively impacting our ability to increase our prices 

in addition we believe the downward pressure on and periodically depressed levels of united states steel prices in recent years have been further exacerbated by imports of steel involving dumping and subsidy abuses by foreign steel producers some foreign steel producers are owned controlled or subsidized by foreign governments as a result decisions by these producers with respect to their production sales and pricing are sometimes influenced to a greater degree by political and economic policy considerations than by prevailing market conditions realities of the marketplace or consideration of profit or loss however while some tariffs and quotas have recently been put into effect for certain steel products imported from a number of countries that have been found to have been unfairly pricing steel imports to the united states there is no assurance that already imposed tariffs and quotas will remain in place or that new ones even if justified will be levied and even when imposed many of these are only shortlived when such tariffs or duties expire or if others are further relaxed or repealed or if relatively higher united states steel prices make it attractive for foreign steelmakers to export their steel products to the united states despite the presence of duties or tariffs the resurgence of substantial imports of foreign steel could create downward pressure on united states steel prices 

the continued global economic slowdown and the difficult conditions in the global industrial capital and credit markets that have resulted have adversely affected and may continue to adversely affect our industry as well as the industries of many of our customers and suppliers upon whom we are dependent 

many of the markets in which our customers participate such as construction automotive manufacturing transportation heavy and agriculture equipment and pipe and tube including octg markets are cyclical in nature and experience significant fluctuations in demand for our steel products based on economic conditions consumer demand raw material and energy costs and decisions by our government to fund or not fund infrastructure projects such as highways bridges schools energy plants railroads and transportation facilities many of these factors are beyond our control these markets are highly competitive to a large extent driven by enduse markets and may experience overcapacity all of which may affect demand for and pricing of our products 

a decline in consumer and business confidence and spending together with reductions in the availability of credit or increased cost of credit as well as volatility in the capital and credit markets could adversely affect the business and economic environment in which we operate and the profitability of our business we are also exposed to risks associated with the creditworthiness of our suppliers and customers if the availability of credit to fund or support the continuation and expansion of our customers business operations is curtailed or if the cost of that credit is increased the resulting inability of our customers or of their customers to access either credit or absorb the increased cost of that credit could adversely affect our business by reducing our sales or by increasing our exposure to losses from uncollectible customer accounts a renewed disruption of the credit markets could also result in financial instability of some of our suppliers and customers the consequences of such adverse effects could include the interruption of production at the facilities of our customers the reduction delay or cancellation of customer orders delays or interruptions of the supply of raw materials we purchase and bankruptcy of customers suppliers or other creditors any of these events may adversely affect our profitability cash flow and financial condition 

volatility and major fluctuations in scrap metal and pig iron prices and our potential inability to pass higher costs on to our customers may constrain operating levels and reduce profit margins 

steel producers require large amounts of raw materials including scrap metal and scrap substitute products such as pig iron pelletized iron and other supplies such as graphite electrodes and ferroalloys our principal raw material is scrap metal derived primarily from junked automobiles industrial scrap railroad cars railroad track materials agricultural machinery and demolition scrap from obsolete structures containers and machines the prices for scrap are subject to market forces largely beyond our control including demand by united states and international steel producers freight costs and speculation the prices for scrap have varied significantly may vary significantly in the future and do not necessarily fluctuate in tandem with the price of steel moreover some of our integrated steel producer competitors are not as dependent as we are on scrap as a part of their raw material melt mix which during periods of high scrap costs relative to the cost of blast furnace iron used by the integrated producers give them a raw material cost advantage over minimills while our vertical integration into the metals recycling business through our omnisource operations and into the ironmaking business through our idi facility should enable us to continue being a costeffective supplier to our own steelmaking operations for some of our metallics requirements we will still need to rely on other metallics and raw material suppliers as well as upon general industry supply conditions for the balance of our needs 

 

purchase prices for auto bodies scrap metal and scrap substitute products such as pig iron that we consume and selling prices for scrap and recycled metals that we sell to third parties are volatile and beyond our control while omnisource attempts to respond to changing recycled metal selling prices through adjustments to its metal purchase prices its ability to do so is limited by competitive and other market factors changing prices could potentially impact the volume of scrap metal available to us and the volume and realized margins of processed metals we sell 

the availability and prices of raw materials may also be negatively affected by new laws and regulations allocation by suppliers interruptions in production accidents or natural disasters changes in exchange rates global price fluctuations and the availability and cost of transportation 

if prices for ferrous metallics increase by a greater margin than corresponding price increases for the sale of our steel products we may not be able to recoup such cost increases from increases in the selling prices of steel products conversely depressed prices for ferrous scrap may constrain its supply which may adversely affect our metals recycling operations and also the availability of certain grades of scrap for our steelmaking operations additionally our inability to pass on all or any substantial part of any cost increases during periods of rapidly rising scrap prices through scrap or other surcharges or to provide for our customers needs because of the potential unavailability of key raw materials or other inputs may result in production curtailments or may otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations or prospects 

﻿ 

the cost and availability of electricity and natural gas are also subject to volatile market conditions 

﻿ 

steel producers like us consume large amounts of energy inasmuch as minimills melt ferrous scrap in electric arc furnaces and use natural gas to reheat steel or steel billets for rolling into finished products we rely on third parties for the supply of energy resources we consume in our steelmaking activities the prices for and availability of electricity natural gas oil and other energy resources are also subject to volatile market conditions often affected by weather conditions as well as political and economic factors beyond our control as large consumers of electricity and gas we must have dependable delivery in order to operate accordingly we are at risk in the event of an energy disruption prolonged blackouts or brownouts or disruptions caused by natural disasters or by political considerations would substantially disrupt our production in addition a significant portion of our finished steel products are delivered by truck unforeseen fluctuations in the price of fuel attributable to fluctuations in crude oil prices would also have a negative impact on our costs or on the costs of many of our customers in addition changes in certain environmental regulations in the united states including those that may impose output limitations or higher costs associated with climate change or greenhouse gas emissions legislation could substantially increase the cost of manufacturing and raw materials such as energy to us and other united states steel producers 

﻿ 

fluctuations in the value of the united states dollar relative to other currencies may adversely affect our business 

﻿ 

fluctuations in the value of the dollar can be expected to affect our business a strong united states dollar such as recently makes imported products less expensive potentially resulting in more imports of steel products into the united states by our foreign competitors while a weak united states dollar may have the opposite impact on imports 

compliance with and changes in environmental and remediation requirements could result in substantially increased capital requirements and operating costs 

existing laws or regulations as currently interpreted or as may be interpreted in the future as well as future laws or regulations may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

we are subject to comprehensive local state federal and international statutory and regulatory environmental requirements relating to among other things 





















 

  

compliance with environmental laws and regulations which affect our steelmaking metals recycling and ironmaking operations is a significant factor in our business we are required to obtain and comply with environmental permits and licenses and failure to obtain or renew or the violation of any permit or license could result in substantial fines and penalties suspension of operations andor the closure of a subject facility similarly delays increased costs andor the imposition of onerous conditions to the securing or renewal of operating permits could have a material adverse effect on these operations 

private parties might also bring claims against us under citizen suit provisions andor for alleged property damage or personal injury resulting from the environmental impacts of our operations moreover legal requirements change frequently are subject to interpretation and have tended to become more stringent over time uncertainty regarding adequate pollution control levels testing and sampling procedures and new pollution control technology are factors that may increase our future compliance expenditures we are unable to predict the ultimate cost of future compliance with these requirements or their effect on our operations although we work hard to be in substantial compliance with all applicable laws and regulations legal requirements frequently change and are subject to interpretation new laws regulations and changing interpretations by regulatory authorities together with uncertainty regarding adequate pollution control levels testing and sampling procedures and evolving pollution control technology are among the factors that may increase our future expenditures to comply with environmental requirements the cost of complying with existing laws or regulations as currently interpreted or reinterpreted in the future or with future laws or regulations may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

our manufacturing and metals recycling operations produce significant amounts of byproducts some of which are handled as solid or hazardous waste for example our mills generate electric arc furnace eaf dust which the united states environmental protection agency united states epa and other regulatory authorities classify as hazardous waste and regulate accordingly 

in addition the primary feed materials for the shredders operated by our metals recycling operations include automobile hulks and obsolete household appliances a portion of the feed materials consist of unrecyclable material known as shredder residue if laws or regulations the interpretation of the laws or regulations or testing methods change with regard to eaf dust or shredder residue we may incur significant additional expenditures 

cercla enables the united states epa state agencies and certain private parties to recover from owners operators generators and transporters the cost of investigation and cleanup of sites at which hazardous substances were disposed in connection with cercla and analogous state laws we may be required to clean up contamination discovered at our sites including contamination that may have been caused by former owners or operators of the sites to conduct additional cleanup at sites that have already had some cleanup performed andor to perform cleanup with regard to sites formerly used in connection with our operations 

in addition we may be required to pay for or to pay a portion of the costs of cleanup at sites to which we sent materials for disposal or recycling notwithstanding that the original disposal or recycling activity may have complied with all regulatory requirements then in effect pursuant to cercla a party can be held jointly and severally liable for all of the cleanup costs associated with a disposal site in practice a liable party often splits the costs of cleanup with other potentially responsible parties we have received notices from the united states epa state agencies and third parties that we have been identified as potentially responsible for the cost of investigating and cleaning up a number of disposal sites in most cases many other parties are also named as potentially responsible parties 

because cercla can be imposed retroactively on shipments that occurred many years ago and because the united states epa and state agencies are still discovering sites that pose a threat to public health or the environment we can provide no assurance that we will not become liable for significant costs associated with investigation and remediation of cercla cleanup sites 

cercla including the superfund recycling equity act of 1999 limits the exposure of scrap metal recyclers for sales of certain recyclable material under certain circumstances however the recycling defense is subject to a number of limitations and may be found not to apply to all instances of recycling activity that we conduct 

increased regulation associated with climate change and greenhouse gas emissions ghg could impose significant additional costs on both our steelmaking and metals recycling operations 

the united states government or various governmental agencies may introduce additional regulatory changes in response to the potential impacts of climate change international treaties or agreements may also result in increasing regulation of ghg emissions including the introduction of carbon emissions trading mechanisms any such regulation regarding climate change and greenhouse gas or ghg emissions could impose significant costs on our steelmaking and metals recycling operations and on the operations of our customers and suppliers including increased energy capital equipment environmental monitoring and reporting and other costs in order to comply with current or future laws or regulations concerning and limitations imposed on our operations by virtue of climate change and ghg emissions laws and regulations any adopted future climate change and greenhouse regulations could negatively impact our ability and that of our customers and suppliers to compete with companies situated in areas not subject to such limitations 

from a medium and longterm perspective we are likely to see an increase in costs relating to our assets that emit significant amounts of greenhouse gases as a result of these regulatory initiatives these regulatory initiatives may impact our operations directly or through our suppliers or 

 

customers until the timing scope and extent of any future regulation becomes known we cannot predict the effect on our financial condition operating performance and ability to compete 

risks related to the business 

our senior secured credit facility contains and any future financing agreements may contain restrictive covenants that may limit our flexibility 

restrictions and covenants in our existing debt agreements including our senior secured credit facility and any future financing agreements may impair our ability to finance future operations or capital needs or to engage in other business activities specifically these agreements may limit or restrict our ability to 





















a breach of any of the restrictions or covenants could cause a default under our senior secured credit facility our senior notes or our other debt a significant portion of our indebtedness then may become immediately due and payable if the default is not remedied 

under our senior secured credit facility we are required to maintain certain financial covenants tied to our leverage and profitability our ability to meet such covenants or other restrictions can be affected by events beyond our control if a default were to occur the lenders could elect to declare all amounts then outstanding to be immediately due and payable and terminate all commitments to extend further credit if we are unable to repay those amounts the lenders could proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure such indebtedness we have pledged substantially all of our receivables and inventories and all shares of capital stock or other equity interests of our subsidiaries and intercompany debt held by us as collateral for our senior secured credit facility 

we may face significant price and other forms of competition from other steel producers scrap processors and alternative materials which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operation or prospects 

the global markets in which steel companies and scrap processors conduct business are highly competitive and became even more so due to continued global economic slowdown and consolidations in the steel and scrap industries additionally in many applications steel competes with other materials such as aluminum cement composites plastics carbon fiber glass and wood increased use of alternative materials could decrease demand for steel and combined with increased competition could cause us to lose market share increase expenditures or reduce pricing any one of which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations or prospects the global steel industry suffers from overcapacity and that excess capacity intensifies price competition in some of our products a decrease in the global demand for steel scrap due to market or other conditions generally causes a decrease in the price of scrap metals a decrease in price could result in some scrap generators exiting the marketplace which could further decrease the availability of scrap this shortage in availability of scrap could have a material adverse effect on both our steelmaking and our metals recycling operations and thus on our business financial condition results of operations or prospects 

we are subject to significant risks relating to changes in commodity prices and may not be able to effectively protect against these risks 

we are exposed to commodity price risk during periods where we hold scrap metal inventory for processing or resale prices of commodities including scrap can be volatile due to numerous factors beyond our control in an increasing price environment for raw materials competitive conditions may limit our ability to pass on price increases to our consumers in a decreasing price environment for processed scrap we may not have the ability to fully recoup the cost of raw materials that we procure process and sell to our customers in addition new entrants into the market areas we serve could result in higher purchase prices for raw materials and lower margins from our scrap we have not hedged positions in certain 

 

commodities where futures markets are not well established thus our sales and inventory position will be vulnerable to adverse changes in commodity prices which could materially adversely impact our operating and financial performance 

the profitability of our metals recycling operations depends in part on the availability of an adequate source of supply 

we procure our scrap inventory from numerous sources these suppliers generally are not bound by longterm contracts and have no obligation to sell recyclable metal to us in periods of low industry prices suppliers may elect to hold recyclable metal to wait for higher prices or intentionally slow their metal collection activities if a substantial number of suppliers cease selling recyclable metal to us we will be unable to recycle metal at desired levels and our results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected in addition a slowdown of industrial production in the united states reduces the supply of industrial grades of metal to the metal recycling industry resulting in our having less recyclable metal available to process and market 

we may face risks associated with the implementation of our growth strategy 

our growth strategy subjects us to various risks as part of our growth strategy we may expand existing facilities enter into new product or process initiatives acquire or build additional plants acquire other businesses and assets enter into joint ventures or form strategic alliances that we believe will complement our existing business these transactions will likely involve some or all of the following risks 





























﻿ 





these initiatives or transactions might be required for us to remain competitive but we may not be able to complete any such transactions on favorable terms or obtain financing if necessary future transactions may not improve our competitive position and business prospects as anticipated and if they do not our sales and earnings may be significantly reduced 

impairment charges could adversely affect our results of operations   

occasionally assumptions that we have made regarding products or businesses we have acquired or sought to develop about the sustainability of markets we sought to exploit or about industry conditions that underlay our decisionmaking when we elected to capitalize a venture turn out differently than anticipated in such instances the fair value of such assets may fall below their carrying value recorded on our balance sheet 

 

accordingly we periodically test goodwill intangible assets and longlived assets to determine whether their estimated fair value is in fact less than their value recorded on our balance sheet if we determine that the fair value of any of these assets from whatever cause is less than the value recorded on our balance sheet we are required to incur noncash asset impairment charges such as those recorded in current and past years that adversely affect our results of operations there can be no assurances that continued market dynamics or other factors may not result in future impairment charges 

we are subject to litigation and legal compliance risks which could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and liquidity 

we recently entered into settlement agreements in connection with a longstanding class action antitrust lawsuit standard iron works v arcelor mittal et al  brought against us and others in chicago federal court in 2008 by both direct and indirect purchasers of steel products alleging a price fixing conspiracy to limit the output of steel the settlements recorded in 2016 are awaiting final court approval involved the aggregate payment into escrow of approximately 56 million in early 2017 

we are additionally involved from time to time in various routine litigation matters including administrative proceedings regulatory proceedings governmental investigations environmental matters and commercial and construction contract disputes none of which at the present time are expected to have a material impact on our financial conditions results of operations or liquidity for additional information regarding legal proceedings please refer to item 3 legal proceedings  

in addition to risks associated with our environmental and other regulatory compliance our international operations are subject to complex foreign and united states laws and regulations including the foreign corrupt practices act regulations related to importexport controls the office of foreign assets control and other laws and regulations each of which may increase our cost of doing business and expose us to increased risk 

unexpected equipment downtime or shutdowns could adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and prospects 

interruptions in our production capabilities could adversely affect our production costs products available for sale and earnings during the affected period in addition to equipment failures our facilities are also subject to the risk of catastrophic loss due to unanticipated events such as fires explosions or violent weather conditions our manufacturing processes are dependent upon critical pieces of steelmaking equipment such as our furnaces continuous casters and rolling equipment as well as electrical equipment such as transformers this equipment may on occasion be out of service as a result of unanticipated failures or other events we have experienced and may in the future experience plant shutdowns or periods of reduced production as a result of such equipment failures or other events these disruptions could have an adverse effect on our operations customer service levels financial results and prospects 

we have incurred and may incur in the future costs to idle facilities idled facility carrying costs or increased costs to resume production at idled facilities 

due to a significant and sustained decline in global pig iron pricing which resulted in the cost of iron nugget production being higher than product selling values we indefinitely idled our minnesota ironmaking operations in may 2015 we incurred approximately 348 million inclusive of noncontrolling interest of 51 million of expenses related to the idling including 210 million of noncash inventory valuation adjustments in the second quarter of 2015 we continue to incur minor ongoing carrying costs related to these idled facilities and should we in the future resume production we would incur further costs related to preparing the minnesota ironmaking operations for operation performing any required repairs and maintenance and training employees 

should economic or market conditions dictate we may in the future idle additional facilities which may require us to incur additional idling and carrying costs related to those facilities as well as further increased costs should production be resumed at any idled facility which could have an adverse effect on our financial results and results of operations 

we may face risks to the security of our information technology 

increased global information technology security requirements vulnerabilities threats and a rise in sophisticated and targeted cybercrime pose a risk to the security of our systems our information networks and to the confidentiality availability and integrity of our data as well as to the functionality of our automated and electronically controlled manufacturing operating systems although we have adopted procedures and controls to protect our information and operating technology including sensitive proprietary information and confidential and personal data there can be no assurance that a system or network failure or security breach will be prevented this could lead to system interruption production delays or downtimes and operational disruptions the disclosure modification or destruction of proprietary and other key information which could have an adverse effect on our reputation financial results and results of operations

2016 overview 

﻿ 

we are one of the largest steel producers and one of the largest metals recyclers in the united states based on a current estimated annual steelmaking and coating capability of approximately 11 million tons and actual recycling volumes the primary sources of our revenues and operating income are from the manufacture and sale of steel products processing and sale of recycled ferrous and nonferrous metals and fabrication and sale of steel joists and deck  we have three reportable segments steel operations metals recycling operations and steel fabrication operations 

our consolidated results for 2016 benefited from positive momentum in the sheet steel supply environment driving improved sheet steel volume and metal spreads as well as increased metal spread and operating cost reductions in our metals recycling operations underlying domestic steel consumption remained relatively consistent as the automotive markets were strong and construction improved throughout the year while heavy equipment agriculture and energy markets remained weak  sheet steel import levels declined during 2016 as compared to 2015 amidst the duties levied pursuant to the trade cases filed with the u nited s tates international trade commission and customer inventory levels remained low compared to historical averages d omestic steel mill utilization rates were flat in 2016 compared to 2015 resulting in lower ferrous volumes in our metals recycling operations our metal spreads improved particularly in nonferrous materials and we benefited from continued operational cost containment efforts the nonresidential construction market for our steel fabrication operations remained strong resulting in record shipments however average selling prices contracted outpacing declining steel input costs resulting in compressed metal spread during 2016 

asset impairment charges 

during the fourth quarter of 2016 we undertook an assessment of the recoverability of the carrying amounts of primarily the mining resources and mesabi mining fixed assets within our minnesota ironmaking operation s with our outlook at the time of this assessment regarding future cash flows  we concluded that the carrying value of some of the fixed assets was no longer fully recoverable and they were in fact impaired this assessment resulted in a 1273 million noncash asset impairment charge including amount s attributable to n oncontrolling interests of 131 million which reduced net income attributable to steel dynamics inc by  729 million for t he year ended december 31 2016  also during the fourth quarter of 2016 a 55 million omnisource goodwill impairment charge was recorded in conjunction with omnisource entering into a definitive sale agreement with a thirdparty pertaining to certain omnisource longlived assets classified and reported as held for sale as of december 31 2016 inventory and spare parts as provided under asc 350  

vulcan threaded products inc acquisition 

on august 1 2016 we acquired 100 of vulcan threaded products inc vulcan for 1130 million paid in cash from available funds vulcan is the nation’s largest manufacturer and supplier of threaded rod products and also produces cold drawn and heat treated steel bar the acquisition of vulcan is consistent with one of our target growth objectives – highermargin downstream business opportunities that utilize our steel products in their manufacturing processes vulcan utilizes specialbarquality products produced at our engineered bar products division postclosing operating results of vulcan are reflected in the steel operations reporting segment  

excluding the impact of the 1328 million and 4285 million in pretax noncash asset impairment charges in 2016 and 2015 respectively consolidated operating income increased 5051 million or 142 to 8608 million in 2016 compared to 3557 million in 2015 and net income attributable to steel dynamics inc increased  320 3 million or 232  to  4586 million or 187 per diluted share during 2016 co mpared with net income of 1383 million or 057 per diluted share during 2015  the impact of the 1328 million pretax noncash asset impairment charges including amounts attributable to noncontrolling i nterests of 131 million reduced 2016 net income attributable to steel dynamics inc by  764 million and our diluted earnings per share by 031 the impact of the 4285 million pretax noncash asset impairment charge reduced 2015 net income attributable to steel dynamics inc by 2687 million and our diluted earnings per share by 111 

 

2015 overview 

﻿ 

our 2015 consolidated operational and financial results were negatively impacted by decreased steel shipments excluding columbus flat roll division for the 2015 and 2014 periods and average steel product pricing driven by excessive and historically high levels of steel imports while scrap costs also decreased significantly throughout 2015 steel metal margins contracted as the drop in steel selling prices was more severe than the decline of scrap costs underlying domestic steel consumption remained steady as we continue d to see improvements in nonresidential construction as well as steady consumption in automotive and other manufacturing segments however a larger portion of the domestic steel demand was served by imports in 2015 than compared to 2014 as a result of this as well as customer destocking domestic steel mill utilization rates decreased throughout 2015 as compared to 2014 resulting in decreased ferrous scrap shipments in our metals recycling operations decreased shipments along with metal margin compression due to monthly price declines resulted in significantly reduced profitability in our metals recycling operations in 2015 as compared to 2014 during 2015 our steel fabrication operations continued to benefit from the sustained improvements in nonresidential construction demand our market share and expanding geographic footprint and lower steel raw material costs resulting in significant increases in both sales and operating income compared to 2014 

﻿ 

asset impairment charges 

in the fourth quarter of 2015 we recorded pretax noncash impairment charges related to goodwill indefinitelived intangibles and certain other assets associated with omnisource our metal recycling operations which reduced 2015 operating income by 4285 million and net income and net income attributable to steel dynamics inc by 2687 million and basic and diluted earnings per share by 111 during our 2015 annual goodwill and indefinitelived intangible asset impairment analysis we determined that the fair value of omnisource was less than its carrying value and upon the completion of the second step of the impairment analysis that the goodwill and trade name indefinitelived intangible assets were impaired the omnisource goodwill and trade name assets were written down to their respective fair values resulting in noncash asset impairment charges of 3413 million and 685 million respectively upon the december 31 2015  determination and classification of certain omnisource property and plant assets as held for sale we recorded a 103 million noncash asset impairment we reflected a total of 4285 million of pretax noncash asset impairment charges in the consolidated statement of operations for the year ended december 31 2015 within the metals recycling operations   during the fourth quarter of 2014  we recorded a 2600 million pretax noncash asset impairment charge in other nonsegment operations related primarily to mesabi nugget fixed assets within our minnesota ironmaking operations  including amounts attributable to noncontrolling interests of 465 million which reduced net income attributable to steel dynamics inc by 1326 million 

excluding the impact of the 4285 million and 2600 million in pretax noncash impairment charges in 2015 and 2014 respectively consolidated operating income decreased 2246 million or 39 to 3557 million in 2015 compared to 5803 million in 2014 and net income decreased 1513 million or 52 to 1383 million or 057 per diluted share during 2015 compared with net income of 2896 million or 122 per diluted share during 2014 the impact of the 4285 million pretax noncash impairment charge related to our metals recycling operations reduced 2015 net income by 2687 million and our diluted earnings per share by 111 the impact of the 2600 million pretax noncash asset impairment charge related to our minnesota ironmaking operations including amounts attributable to noncontrolling interests of 465 million reduced 2014 net income attributable to steel dynamics inc by 1326 million and our diluted earnings per share by 055

segment results 2016 vs 2015 

overall steel operations performance in 2016 compared to 2015 benefited from positive momentum throughout the year in the sheet steel supply environment as the excessively high levels of steel imports experienced in 2015 and 2014 declined approximately 15 in 2016 on a yearoveryear basis duties levied in 2016 pursuant to the trade case rulings from the u nited s tates international trade commission coupled with low customer inventories compared to historical levels precipitated higher domestic steel shipments and higher utilization for our steel mills our steel mill utilization rate improved to 87  for 2016 as compared to 79  in 2015  with our sheet steel utilization rate improving to 99 in 2016 from 86 in 2015  the domestic steel demand outlook remained relatively unchanged throughout 2016 as automotive markets were strong and construction improved throughout the year while heavy equipment agriculture and energy markets remained challenged  overall steel selling prices improved during the last three quarters of 2016 from the significant decline that occurred throughout 2015 and early 2016 as sheet steel imports declined  net sales for the steel operations increased 8 in 2016 when compared to 2015 as an 11 increase in steel operations shipments more than offset a decrease of 15 per ton or 2 in average selling prices 

﻿ 

metallic raw materials used in our electric arc furnaces represent our single most significant stee l manufacturing cost generally comprising approximately 60 of our steel operations’ manufacturing costs excluding the operations of the techs and vulcan which purchase rather than produce the steel they further process our metallic raw material cost per net ton consumed in our steel operations decreased 35 or 14  in 2016 compared to 2015 consistent with overall ferrous scrap market pricing 

﻿ 

operating income for the steel operations increased 130 to 9270 million in 2016 compared to 2015 due to a n 11 increase in steel shipments coupled with a 5  increase in overall steel operations metal spread which we define as the difference between average selling prices and the cost of ferrous scrap consumed expansion sheet steel metal spread expanded 15 while long prod ucts metal spread contracted 9 as domestic overcapacity and an aggressive competitive environment continued  

 

segment results 2015 vs 2014 

overall steel operations performance in 2015 compared to 2014 was negatively impacted by excessive and historically high levels of steel imports customers destocking inventories and sharply falling steel and scrap prices domestic steel consumption was relatively steady during 2015 with strong automotive and improving nonresidential steel markets but a large portion of the domestic consumption was served by imports net sales for the steel operations decreased 7 in 2015 when compared to 2014 as a 14 increase in steel operations shipments was more than offset by a decrease of 149 per ton or 18 in average selling prices in spite of solid overall domestic steel demand average selling prices decreased throughout 2015 due to elevated levels of imported steel into the united states and significant reductions in the cost of scrap which also caused uncertainty for steel consumers steel operations shipments increased 14 in 2015 compared to 2014 with the inclusion of columbus flat roll division for the full year of 2015 acquired september 16 2014 as 2015 sales volumes excluding columbus flat roll division were down 12 compared to 2014 

﻿ 

metallic raw materials used in our electric arc furnaces represent our single most significant steel manufacturing cost generally comprising approximately 60 of our steel operations’ manufacturing costs  our metallic raw material cost per net ton consumed in our steel operations decreased 105 or 29 in 2015 compared with 2014 consistent with overall declines in ferrous scrap market pricing 

﻿ 

decreases in steel selling prices more than offset decreases in raw material cost per ton resulting in 2015 metal spread contracting significantly compared to 2014 thus despite increased shipments from the inclusion of columbus flat roll division for the full year 2015 versus only four and a half months in 2014 operating income for the steel operations decreased 41 to 4032 million compared to 2014

metals recycling operations operating income in 2016 of 204 million was 401 million higher than 2015  excluding the impact in 2015 of 4285 million of impairment charges  due to our continued focus on reduction of operating costs along with improved ferrous and nonferrous metal spread s which we define as the difference between average selling prices and the cost of purchased scrap net sales decreased 7 in 2016 compared to 2015 with ferrous and nonferrous selling pric es decreasing 5 and 9 respectively while total ferrous and nonferrous shipments were comparable during 2016 and 2015 metal spreads increased 11 and 10 respectively as scrap costs declined more than selling prices driving improved operating income during 2016  with improved utilization at our steel mills in 2016 the metals recycling operations ferrous shipments to our mills increased to 61 of total tons shipped in 2016 compared to 54 in 2015  

﻿ 

segment results 2015 vs 2014 

m etals recycling operations performance in 2015 compared to 2014 was negatively impacted by excess domestic scrap competition a strong united states dollar tempering scrap exports and lower domestic steel mill utilizations resulting in substantial decreases in selling prices metals recycling operations net sales decreased 34 in 2015 as compared to 2014 with ferrous and nonferrous volumes both decreasing 8 in 2015 as compared to 2014 similarly both ferrous and nonferrous selling prices declined 37 and 18 respectively during 2015 as compared to 2014 consistent with overall declines in scrap market selling prices metal spreads for ferrous and nonferrous materials contracted 14 and 18

other operations consists of subsidiary operations that are below the quantitative thresholds required for reportable segments and primarily consist of our minnesota ironmaking operations that were indefinitely idled in may 2015 and smaller joint ventures also included in “other” are certain unallocated corporate accounts such as the company’s senior secured credit facility senior notes certain other investments and certain profit sharing expenses  

our minnesota ironmaking operations consists of mesabi nugget owned 8 3  by us our whollyowned iron concentrate and potential future iron mining operations mesabi mining and our whollyowned as of december 31 2016 iron tailin gs operations mining resources  as of december 31 2016 we acquired all 151 million of the mining resources noncontrolling investor ’s units of redeemable noncontrolling stock it owned at the time for cancellation and discharge of all obligations owed to mining resources and termination of all existing agreements with the noncontrolling investor at that time prior to this transaction  82 of mining resources was owned by us 

significant events occurred during the fourth quarter of 2016 including the previously noted termination of all existing agreements with the mining resources noncontrolling investor that represented impairment indicators related primarily to mining resources and mesabi mining fixed assets within our minnesota ironmaking operations these impairment indicators were substantively separate and different from the impairment indicators that existed within our minnesota ironmaking operations in the fourth quarter of 2014 discussed below with the company’s outlook at the time of this 2016 assessment regarding future cash flows the company concluded that the carrying amounts of the fixed assets were no longer fully recoverable and they were in fact impaired this assessment resulted in a noncash asset impairment charge of 1273 million including amounts attributable to noncontrolling interests of 131 million which reduced net income attributable to steel dynamics inc by 729 million for the year ended december 31 2016 

during the fourth quarter of 2014 our minnesota ironmaking operations reached a steady operating state indicating a consistency in the operations’ production capability processes and cost structure including the ability to utilize certain lowercost raw materials given this we undertook an assessment of the recoverability of the minnesota ironmaking operations based upon impairment indicators at that time given our outlook at that time regarding future operating costs and product pricing and resulting future cash flows we concluded that the carrying amounts of primarily our mesabi nugget fixed assets  within our minnesota ironmaking operations were no longer fully recoverable and were in fact impaired this assessment resulted in noncash asset impairment charge of 2600 million including amounts attributable to noncontrolling interests of 465 million which reduced net income attributable to steel dynamics inc by 1326 million for the year ended december 31 2014 

consolidated results 2016 vs 2015 

selling general and administrative expenses   selling general and administrative expenses including profit sharing and amortization of intangible assets of  4741 million during 2016 increased 26  from  3760 million during 2015 representing approximately 61  and 50 of net sales respectively  the increase in 2016 compared to 2015 is due most notably to increased performancebased incentive compensation including profit sharing associated with our increased profitability  

interest expense net of capitalized interest during 2016 interest expense decreased 7 9 million to  1460 million when compared to 2015 the decrease in interest expense is due primarily to the call and prepayment of our 3500 million 7 5  8  senior notes due 2020 in march 2015  

other expense income net during 2016 net other expense of 178 million included 165 million of call premium and other financing costs associated with the december 2016 senior notes tender call and prepayment net other expense of 154 million in 2015 includes 167 million of call premium and other financing costs associated with the march 2015 senior notes call and prepayment 

income tax expense benefit during 2016  our income tax expense was  2041 million at an effective income tax rate of 362  as compared to a benefit of  969 million resulting in an effective income tax rate of 400  during 2015  the lower effective tax rate in 2016 was due primarily to benefits from other permanent tax benefit items most notably the 2016 domestic manufacturing deduction available in years with taxable income 

included in the balance of unrecognized tax benefits of 191 million at december 31 2016 are potential benefits of 118 million that if recognized would affect the effective tax rate we recognize interest and penalties related to our tax contingencies on a netoftax basis in income tax expense during the year ended december 31 2016 we recognized expense from the increase of interest expense of 170000 net of tax in addition to the unrecognized tax benefits noted above we had 48 million accrued for the payment of interest and penalties at december 31 2016 

we file income tax returns in the united states federal jurisdiction as well as income tax returns in various state jurisdictions the irs is currently examining our federal income tax returns for the years 2010 through 2015 at this time we do not believe there will be any significant examination adjustments that would result in a material change to our financial position results of operations or cash flows it is reasonably possible that the amount of unrecognized tax benefits could change in the next twelve months as a result of these federal income tax audits and state income tax audits based on the current audits in process the payment of taxes as a result of audit settlements could be in an amount from zero to 57 million by the end of 2017 with the exception of the 2010 federal return which is currently under audit we are no longer subject to federal state and local income tax examinations by tax authorities for years ended before 2011  

 

consolidated results 2015 vs 2014 

selling general and administrative expenses selling general and administrative expenses including profit sharing and amortization of intangible assets of 3760 million during 2015 were comparable to 3859 million during 2014 representing approximately 49 and 44 of net sales respectively  

interest expense net of capitalized interest during 2015 interest expense increased 177 million or 12 to 1540 million when compared to 2014 the increase in interest expense is due primarily to the addition of the 12 billion senior notes in september 2014 in conjunction with our acquisition of columbus flat roll division partially offset by the conversion or payoff at maturity of 2875 million of 5125 convertible notes in june 2014 and the call and prepayment of our 3500 million 7 5  8  senior notes due 2020 in march 2015 

other expense income net during 2015 net other expense of 154 million included 167 million of call premium and other financing costs associated with the march 2015 senior notes call and prepayment net other expense of 183 million in 2014 included 252 million of acquisition and financing costs associated with our september 2014 columbus flat roll division acquisition 

income tax expense benefit during 2015 our income tax benefit was 969 million at an effective income tax rate of 400 as compared to expense of 732 million resulting in an effective income tax rate of 444 during 2014 the higher effective tax rate in 2014 was due primarily to the impact of the increased noncontrolling interest losses offset somewhat by increased benefits from other permanent tax benefit items most notably the domestic manufacturing deduction available in years with taxable income 

liquidity and capital resources 

capital resources and long ‑term debt our business is capital intensive and requires substantial expenditures for among other things the purchase and maintenance of equipment used in our steel metals recycling and steel fabrication operations and to remain in compliance with environmental laws our shortterm and longterm liquidity needs arise primarily from working capital requirements capital expenditures principal and interest payments related to our outstanding indebtedness dividends to our shareholders and acquisitions we have met these liquidity requirements primarily with cash provided by operations and longterm borrowings and we also have availability under our revolver  our liquidity at december 31 2016 is as follows in thousands 

﻿ 



﻿ 

in december 2016 we issued 4000 million of 5000 senior notes due 2026 the 2026 notes the proceeds of which along with available cash w ere used to fund the december 2016 tender offer to purchase at a redemption price of 103388 a total of 2663 million principal amount  plus accrued and unpaid interest to but not including the date of repurchase of our 6125 senior notes due 2019 the 2019 notes  and the december 2016 call and repayment at a redemption price of 103063 of the 1337 million remaining outstanding principal amount of the 2016 notes plus accrued and unpaid interest to but not including the date of repayment in addition we repaid the remaining 2281 million of outstanding senior term loan debt i n december 2016  which was set to mature on november 14 2019  we recorded expenses related to tender and call premiums write off of unamortized debt issuance costs and other expenses of 16 5 million which are reflected in other expenses in the consolidated statement of operations for the year ended december 31 2016  

﻿ 

our total outstanding debt decreased 2378 million during 2016 to 24 billion due primarily to our december 2016 prepayment of 2281 million of outstanding senior term loan debt as described above as a result our total longterm debt to capitalization ratio representing our longterm debt including current maturities divided by the sum of our longterm debt redeemable noncontrolling interests and our total stockholders’ equity decreased to 449 at december 31 2016 from 493 at december 31 2015 

﻿ 

our novem ber 2014 senior secured credit f acility facility  which provides a 12 billion revolver matures november 2019 subject to certain conditions we have the opportunity to increase the revolver size by at least 7500 million the facility is guaranteed by certain of our subsidiaries and is secured by substantially all of our and our whollyowned subsidiaries’ receivables and inventories and by pledges of all shares of our whollyowned subsidiaries’ capital stock or other equity interests and intercompany debt held by us as collateral  the revolver is available to fund working capital capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes the facility contains financial covenants and other covenants pertaining to our ability which may under certain circumstances be limited to make capital expenditures incur indebtedness permit liens on property enter into transactions with affiliates make restricted payments or investments enter into mergers acquisitions or consolidations conduct asset sales pay dividends or distributions or enter into other specified transactions and activities our ability to borrow funds within the terms of the revolver is dependent upon our continued compliance with the financial and other covenants at december 31 2016  we had 12 billion of availability on the revolver 124 million of outstanding letters of credit and other obligations which reduce availability and there were no borrowings outstanding 

﻿ 

the financial covenants under our facility state that we must maintain an interest coverage ratio of not less than 250100 our interest coverage ratio is calculated by d ividing our lasttwelve months ltm consolidated adjusted ebitda earnings before interest taxes depreciation amortization and certain other noncas h transactions as allowed in the facility by our ltm gross interest expense less amortization of financing fees in addition a net debt as defined in the facility to consolidated ltm adjusted ebitda net debt leverage ratio of not more than 500100 

 

must be maintained if the net debt leverage ratio exceeds 350100 at any time our ability to make certain payments as defined in the facility which includes cash dividends to stockholders and share purchases among other things is limited at december 3 1  2016 our interest coverage ratio and net debt leverage ratio were 832 100 and 158 100 respectively we were therefore in compliance with these covenants at december 3 1  2016 and we anticipate we will continue to be in compliance during the next twelve months  

﻿ 

working capital we generated cash flow from operations of 8528 million in 2016 operational working capital representing amounts invested in trade receivables and inventories less current liabilities other than income taxes payable and debt of 13 billion at december 3 1  2016 was comparable to that at december 31 2015 increases in volumes pricing and profitability have resulted in increased accounts receivable and inventory which have been largely offset by increases in accounts payable and accrued expenses  

capital investments during 2016 we invested 1982 million in property plant and equipment compared with 1145 million during 2015 our current estimated 2017 cash allocation plan includes the investment of approximately 200 million in capital expenditures in our existing and announced operations 

cash dividends as a reflection of continued confidence in our current and future cash flow generation ability and financial position we increased our quarterly cash dividend by 2 to 01400 per share in the first quarter 2016 from 01375 per share in 2015 resulting in declared cash dividends of  1365 million during 2016 compared to  1332 million during 2015 we paid cash dividends of  1358 million and  1276 million during 2016 and 2015 respectively our board of directors along with executive management approves the payment of dividends on a quarterly basis the determination to pay cash dividends in the future is at the discretion of our board of directors after taking into account various factors including our financial condition results of operations outstanding indebtedness current and anticipated cash needs and growth plans in addition the terms of our f acility and the indenture s relating to our senior notes may restrict the amount of cash dividends we can pay  

other our ability to meet our debt service obligations and reduce our total debt will depend upon our future performance which in turn will depend upon general economic financial and business conditions along with competition legislation and regulatory factors that are largely beyond our control in addition we cannot assure that our operating results cash flows access to credit markets and capital resources will be sufficient for repayment of our indebtedness in the future we believe that based upon current levels of operations and anticipated growth cash flows from operations together with other available sources of funds including additional borrowings under our revolver through its term will be adequate for the next twelve months for making required payments of principal and interest on our indebtedness funding working capital requirements and anticipated capital expenditures  

during 2016  we received benefits from state and local governments in the form of real estate and personal property tax abatements and credits of approximately 222 million based on our current abatements and incentive credits and utilizing our existing longlived asset structure we estimate the remaining annual benefit to our future operations to be approximately 14 2 million 105 million 89 million 30 million 29 million 28 million and 23 million during the years 2017 through 2023 respectively 

contractual obligations and other longterm liabilities 

﻿ 

we have the following minimum commitments under contractual obligations including purchase obligations as defined by the securities and exchange commission a “purchase obligation” is defined as an agreement to purchase goods or services that is enforceable and legally binding and that specifies all significant terms including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased fixed minimum or variable price provisions and the approximate timing of the transaction other longterm liabilities are defined as longterm liabilities that are reflected on our balance sheet under generally accepted accounting principles based on this definition the following table includes only those contracts which include fixed or minimum obligations it does not include normal purchases which are made in the ordinary course of business the following table provides aggregated information about outstanding contractual obligations and other longterm liabilities as of december 31 2016 in thousands

3 purchase obligations include commitments we have for the purchase of electricity natural gas and its transportation fuel air products and zinc these arrangements have “take or pay” or other similar commitment provisions we have utilized such “take or pay” requirements during the past three years under these contracts except for certain air products at our minnesota ironmaking operations which were idled in may 2015 

4 construction commitments relate to firm contracts we have with various vendors for the completion of certain construction projects at our various divisions at december 31 2016  

5 other commitments principally relate to certain pension and deferred compensation plan obligations 

6 we expect to make cash outlays in the future related to our unrecognized tax benefits however due to the uncertainty of the timing we are unable to make reasonably reliable estimates regarding the period of cash settlement with the respective taxing authorities accordingly unrecognized tax benefits and related interest and penalties of 239 million as of december 31 2016 have been excluded from the contractual obligations table above refer to note 4 to the consolidated financial statements elsewhere in this report for additional information 

other matters 

inflation 

we believe that inflation has not had a material effect on our results of operations 

environmental and other contingencies 

we have incurred and in the future will continue to incur capital expenditures and operating expenses for matters relating to environmental control remediation monitoring and compliance during 2016 we incurred costs related to the monitoring and compliance of environmental matters in the amount of approximately 365 million and capital expenditures related to environmental compliance of approximately 53 million of the costs incurred during 2016 for monitoring and compliance approximately 79 were related to the normal transportation of certain types of waste produced in our steelmaking processes and other facilities in accordance with legal requirements we incurred combined environmental remediation costs of approximately 879000 at all of our facilities during 2016 we have an accrual of 25 million recorded for environmental remediation related to our metals recycling operations 26 million related to minnesota ironmaking operations we believe apart from our dependence on environmental construction and operating permits for our existing and any future manufacturing facilities that compliance with current environmental laws and regulations is not likely to have a materially adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or liquidity however environmental laws and regulations evolve and change and we may become subject to more stringent environmental laws and regulations in the future such as the impact of united states government or various governmental agencies introducing regulatory changes in response to the potential of climate change 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

management’s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states we review the accounting policies we use in reporting our financial results on a regular basis the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent liabilities we evaluate the appropriateness of these estimations and judgments on an ongoing basis we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources results may differ from these estimates due to actual outcomes being different from those on which we based our assumptions we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 

revenue recognition and allowance for doubtful accounts except for our steel fabrication operations we recognize revenues from sales and the allowance for estimated returns and customer claims from these sales at the time title of the product transfers upon shipment provision is made for estimated product returns and customer claims based on historical experience if the historical data used in our estimates does not reflect future returns and claims trends additional provision may be necessary our steel fabrication operations recognizes revenues from construction contracts using a percentage of completion methodology based on steel tons used on completed units to date as a percentage of estimated total steel tons required by each contract the allowance for doubtful accounts for all operating segments is based on our best estimate of probable credit losses along with historical experience which estimates may or may not prove accurate 

we are exposed to credit risk in the event of nonpayment by our customers which in steel operations are principally intermediate steel processors and service centers that sell our products to numerous industry sectors including the construction automotive manufacturing transportation heavy and agriculture equipment and pipe and tube including octg markets our metals recycling operations sell ferrous scrap to steel mills and foundries and nonferrous scrap such as copper brass aluminum and stainless steel to among others ingot manufacturers copper refineries and mills smelters and specialty mills our steel fabrication operations sell fabricated steel joists and deck primarily to the nonresidential construction market we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments based on known credit risks historical loss experience and current economic conditions affecting our customers we mitigate our 

 

exposure to credit risk which we generally extend initially on an unsecured basis by performing ongoing credit evaluations and taking further action when necessary such as requiring letters of credit or other security interests to support the customer receivable if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate resulting in the impairment of their ability to make payments additional allowance may be required 

inventories we record inventories at lower of cost or market cost is determined using a weighted average cost method for raw materials and supplies and on a firstin firstout basis for other inventory we record amounts required if any to reduce the carrying value of inventory to its net realizable value as a charge to cost of goods sold if product selling prices were to decline in future periods further writedown of inventory could result specifically raw material inventory such as scrap purchased during periods of peak market pricing upon deciding to idle the minnesota ironmaking operations and to monetize existing raw material inventory we recorded an inventory lower of cost or market charge of 210 million inclusive of noncontrolling interests of 36 million in cost of goods sold in the second quarter 2015 

impairments of longlived tangible and definite ‑lived intangible assets we review longlived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of such assets may not be fully recoverable impairment losses are recorded on longlived assets used in operations when indicators of impairment are present and the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than the assets’ carrying amounts the impairment loss is measured by comparing the fair value of the asset to its carrying amount we consider various factors and determine whether an impairment test is necessary including by way of examples a significant and prolonged deterioration in operating results andor projected cash flows significant changes in the extent or manner in which an asset is used technological advances with respect to assets which would potentially render them obsolete our strategy and capital planning and the economic climate in markets to be served when determining future cash flows and if necessary fair value we must make judgments as to the expected utilization of assets and estimated future cash flows related to those assets we consider historical and anticipated future results general economic and market conditions the impact of planned business and operational strategies and all other available information at the time the estimates are made those estimates and judgments may or may not ultimately prove accurate 

a longlived asset is classified as held for sale upon meeting specified criteria related to ability and intent to sell an asset classified as held for sale is measured at the lower of its carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell as of december 31 2016 and 2015 the company reported 293 and 86 million respectively of assets held for sale within other current assets in our consolidated balance sheet an impairment loss is recognized for any initial or subsequent writedown of the asset held for sale to its fair value less cost to sell for assets determined to be classified as held for sale in the year ended december 31 2016 the asset carry amounts approximated their fair value less cost to sell we recorded 103 million asset impairment charge in the consolidated statement of operations for asse t s determined to be classified as held for sale in the year ended december 31 2015 the company determined fair value using level 3 inputs as provided for under asc 820 consisting of information provided by brokers and other external sources along with management’s own assumptions 

﻿ 

significant events occurred during the fourth quarter of 2016 including the previously noted termination of all existing agreements with the mining resources noncontrolling investor that represented impairment indicators related primarily to mining resources and mesabi mining fixed assets within our minnesota ironmaking operations these impairment indicators were substantively separate and different from the impairment indicators that existed within our minnesota ironmaking operations in the fourth quarter of 2014 discussed below with the company’s outlook at the time of this 2016 assessment regarding future cash flows the company concluded that the carrying amounts of the fixed assets were no longer fully recoverable and they were in fact impaired this assessment resulted in a noncash asset impairment charge of 1273 million including amounts attributable to noncontrolling interests of 131 million which reduced net income attributable to steel dynamics inc by 729 million for the year ended december 31 2016 

during the fourth quarter of 2014 our minnesota ironmaking operations reached a steady operating state indicating a consistency in the operations’ production capability processes and cost structure including the ability to utilize certain lowercost raw materials given this we undertook an assessment of the recoverability of the minnesota ironmaking operations based upon impairment indicators at that time given our outlook at that time regarding future operating costs and product pricing and resulting future cash flows we concluded that the carrying amounts of primarily our mesabi nugget fixed assets within our minnesota ironmaking operations were no longer fully recoverable and were in fact impaired this assessment resulted in noncash asset impairment charge of 2600 million including amounts attributable to noncontrolling interests of 465 million which reduced net income attributable to steel dynamics inc by 1326 million for the year ended december 31 2014 

goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets 

our goodwill relates to various business combinations and is allocated to the following reporting units at december 31 in thousands 

﻿ 

﻿ 



 

﻿ 

at least once annually as of october 1 or when indicators of impairment exist the company performs an impairment test for goodwill goodwill is allocated to various reporting units which are generally one level below the company’s operating segments we utilize a twostepped approach to evaluate goodwill impairment the first step of the test determines if there is potential goodwill impairment in this step the company compares the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying amount which includes goodwill the fair value of the reporting unit is determined by using an estimate of future cash flows utilizing a riskadjusted discount rate to calculate the net present value of future cash flows income approach and by using a market approach based upon an analysis of valuation metrics of comparable peer companies level 3 inputs as provided for under asc 820 if the fair value exceeds the carrying value there is no impairment if the carrying amount exceeds the fair value the company performs the second step of the test which measures the amount of impairment loss to be recorded in the second step the company compares the carrying amount of the goodwill to the implied fair value of the goodwill based on the net fair value of the recognized and unrecognized assets and liabilities of the reporting unit to which it is allocated if the implied fair value is less than the carrying value an impairment loss is recorded to the extent that the fair value of the goodwill is less than its carrying value  

key assumptions used to determine the estimated fair value of each reporting unit under the discounted cash flows method income approach include a expected cash flows for the fiveyear period following the testing date including market share sales volumes and prices costs to produce and estimated capital needs b an estimated terminal value using a terminal year growth rate determined based on the growth prospects of the reporting unit and c a riskadjusted discount rate based on management’s best estimate of market participants’ aftertax weighted average cost of capital and market risk premiums key assumptions used to determine the estimated fair value of each reporting unit under the market approach include the expected revenues and cash flows in the next year we consider historical and anticipated future results general economic and market conditions the impact of planned business and operational strategies and all available information at the time the fair values of its reporting units are estimated those estimates and judgments may or may not ultimately prove accurate 

goodwill and other intangible assets acquired in past transactions are naturally more susceptible to impairment primarily due to the fact that they are recorded at fair value based on operating plans and economic conditions at the time of acquisition consequently if operating results andor economic conditions deteriorate after an acquisition it could result in the impairment of the acquired assets a deterioration of economic conditions may not only negatively impact the estimated operating cash flows used in our cash flow models but may also negatively impact other assumptions used in our analyses including but not limited to the estimated cost of capital andor discount rates additionally we are required to ensure that assumptions used to determine fair value in our analyses are consistent with the assumptions a hypothetical marketplace participant would use as a result the cost of capital andor discount rates used in our analyses may increase or decrease based on market conditions and trends regardless of whether our actual cost of capital has changed therefore we may recognize an impairment of an intangible asset or assets in spite of realizing actual cash flows that are approximately equal to or greater than our previously forecasted amounts 

at least annually as of october 1 or when indicators of impairment exist we test indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment through the comparison of the fair value of the specific intangible asset with its carrying amount the fair value of the intangible asset is determined by using an estimate of future cash flows attributable to the asset and a riskadjusted discount rate to compute a net present value of future cash flows income approach if the fair value is less than the carrying value an impairment loss is recorded in an amount equal to the excess in carrying value 

our other indefinitelived intangible assets at december 31 2015 relate d to trade names acquired through the omnisource 395 million and the techs 818 million business combinations  we assigned definite useful lives for the techs trade name in january 2016 and the omnisource trade name in november 2016 and thus began to amortize these intangible assets 

during our 2015 annual goodwill and indefinitelived intangible asset impairment assessment we determined that the fair value of omnisource was less than its carrying value and upon the completion of the impairment analysis that the goodwill and trade name indefinitelived assets were impaired the decrease in omnisource fair value from our 2014 impairment analysis was due primarily to the reduction in expected future cash flows based on management’s view at the time of the 2015 analysis of the weak longerterm global scrap commodity outlook this outlook became clearer in the fourth quarter of 2015 from the longevity of 1 the prolonged strength of the united states dollar decreasing scrap export volume resulting in excess domestic supply 2 currency devaluation contributing to china and russia supplying alternative scrap materials to turkey versus those coming from the united states and 3 slower global growth decreasing demand for scrap while the scrap commodity outlook deteriorated throughout much of 2015 there were indicators of improvement during the year such as the restoration of the ratio of iron ore to scrap costs to a more historically consistent relationship as well as a midyear scrap pricing increase versus the monthly decreases experienced throughout much of the year including large decreases in both the first and fourth quarters upon the fourth quarter decrease in selling prices and resulting metal spreads we concluded that the impact of the factors noted above were longerterm which resulted in our reassessment of our future longterm cash flows the omnisource goodwill and trade name indefinitelived intangible assets were written down to their respective fair values resulting in pretax noncash asset impairment charges of 3413 million and 685 million respectively that are reflected in asset impairment charges in the consolidated statement of operations for the year ended december 31 2015 within the metals recycling operations 

our fourth quarter 2016 annual goodwill and indefinitelived intangible asset impairment analyses did not result in any impairment charges management does not believe that it is reasonably likely that our reporting units will fail step one of a goodwill impairment test in the near term the most significant portion of our goodwill relates to the omnisource reporting unit the fair value of omnisource exceeded its carrying value by approximately 19 our analysis based on economic and industry forecasts as well as planned organic growth and cost containment activities contemplates growth in overall scrap consumption and thus our sales volumes and resulting expansion of our metal margins while management believes these assumptions are reasonable and their use appropriate actual results may not meet forecasted results an approximate 15 decrease in forecasted cash flows would not result in a failure of step 1 for the omnisource reporting unit the riskadjusted discount rate used in the analysis is also a critical assumption one in which a minor change can have a significant impact on the estimated fair value a more than 150 basis point 

 

increase in the 130 riskadjusted discount rate used in the omnisource analysis holding other assumptions constant would not result in a failure of step 1 for the reporting unit we will continue to monitor operating results within all reporting units throughout the upcoming year in an effort to determine if events and circumstances warrant interim impairment testing otherwise all reporting units will again be subject to the required annual impairment test during the fourth q uarter of 2017  changes in judgments and estimates underlying our analysis of goodwill for possible impairment including expected future operating cash flows and discount rate could decrease the estimated fair value of our reporting units in the future and could result in an impairment of goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets 

﻿ 

in 2016 a 55 million omnisource goodwill impairment charge was recorded in conjunction with omnisource entering into a definitive sale agreement with a thirdparty pertaining to certain omnisource longlived assets classified and reported as held for sale as of december 31 2016 inventory and spare parts  as provided under asc 350 omnisource goodwill decreased an additional 64 million in 2016 in recognition of the 2016 tax benefit related to the normal amortization of the component of omnisource taxdeductible goodwill in excess of book goodwill 

income taxes we are required to estimate our income taxes as a part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements this requires us to estimate our actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatments of items for tax and accounting purposes these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities which are included within our consolidated balance sheet we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely we must establish a valuation allowance we establish reserves to reduce some or all of the tax benefit of any of our tax positions at the time we determine that the positions become uncertain we adjust these reserves including any impact on the related interest and penalties in light of changing facts and circumstances such as the progress of a tax audit a number of years may elapse before a particular matter for which we have established a reserve is audited by a taxing authority and finally resolved the number of years with open tax audits varies depending on the tax jurisdiction the tax benefit that has been previously reserved because of a failure to meet the more likely than not recognition threshold would be recognized in our income tax expense in the first interim period when the uncertainty disappears settlement of any particular issue would usually require the use of cash 

 




 item 7 a  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

market risk 

in the normal course of business we are exposed to interest rate changes our objectives in managing fluctuations in interest rates are to limit the impact of these rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower overall borrowing costs to achieve these objectives we may use interest rate swaps to manage net exposure to interest rate changes related to our portfolio of borrowings   

the following table represents the principal cash repayments and related weighted ‑average interest rates by maturity date for our longterm debt all of which is fixed rate as of december 31 2016 in thousands 

﻿ 



﻿ 

commodity risk 

in the normal course of business we are exposed to the market risk and price fluctuations related to the sale of our products and to the purchase of raw materials used in our operations such as metallic raw materials electricity natural gas and its transportation services fuel air products and zinc our risk strategy associated with product sales has generally been to obtain competitive prices for our products and to allow operating results to reflect market price movements dictated by supply and demand 

our risk strategy associated with the purchase of raw materials utilized within our operations has generally been to make some commitments with suppliers relating to future expected requirements for some commodities such as electricity natural gas and its transportation services fuel air products and zinc certain of these commitments contain provisions which require us to “take or pay” for specified quantities without regard to actual usage for periods of up to 4 years for physical commodity requirements and commodity transportation requirements and for up to 12 years for air products our commitments for these arrangements with “take or pay” or other similar commitment provisions for the years ending december 31 are as follows in thousands 

﻿ 

﻿ 



﻿ 

we utilized such “take or pay” requirements during the past three years under these contracts except for certain air products at our minnesota ironmaking operations which were idled in may 2015 we believe that production requirements will be such that consumption of the products or services purchased under these commitments will occur in the normal production process other than certain air products related to our minnesota ironmaking operations during the idle period we also purchase electricity consumed at our butler flat roll division pursuant to a contract which extends through december 2017 the contract designates 160 hours annually as “interruptible service” and establishes an agreed fixedrate energy charge per millkwh consumed for each year through the expiration of the agreement 

﻿ 

in our metals recycling operations we have certain fixed price contracts with various customers and suppliers for future delivery of nonferrous metals our risk strategy has been to enter into base metal financial contracts with the goal to protect the profit margin within certain parameters that was contemplated when we entered into the transaction with the customer or vendor at december 31 2016  we had a cumulative unrealized gain associated with these financial contracts of 20 million substantially all of which have a settlement date in 2017 we believe the customer contracts associated with the financial contracts will be fully consummated

 item 1 business 

our company 

steel dynamics inc the company is one of the largest steel producers and one of the largest metals recyclers in the united states based on a current estimated annual steelmaking and coating capability of approximately 11 million tons and actual recycling volumes we reported net sales of 76 billion 88 billion and 74 billion during 2015 2014 and 2013 respectively the primary sources of our revenues are from the manufacture and sale of steel products processing and sale of recycled ferrous and nonferrous metals and the fabrication and sale of steel joist and deck products 

competitive strengths  business strategies 

we believe our financial strength and flexibility coupled with our competitive advantages of maintaining a low highly variable cost structure producing a diversified valueadded product offering controlling a secure supply of recycled ferrous metals fostering an entitywide entrepreneurial culture and having an experienced senior management team and work force positions us well to continue to strengthen our leadership position and execute our growth strategy 

one of the lowest cost steel producers in the united states stateoftheart facilities  continue to maintain low production costs 

we are focused on continuing to maintain and enhance one of the lowest operating cost structures in the north american steel industry our low operating costs are primarily a result of our efficient plant designs and operations our high productivity rate such as our productivity rate of approximately 03 man hours per hot band ton produced at our butler flat roll division low ongoing maintenance cost requirements and strategic locations near our customers and sources of our primary raw material ferrous scrap 

we will continue to strive to optimize the use of our equipment enhance our productivity and explore new technologies to further improve our unit costs of production at each of our facilities as one of the lowest cost producers in each of our three primary operating segments we are able to better manage through cyclical and noncyclical downturns and to consistently maximize our profitability we continuously seek to maximize the variability of our cost structure and to reduce per unit and fixed costs our incentive compensation plans at all employee levels are based on both divisional and consolidated company performance performancebased incentive compensation is designed to reward high productivity and efficient use of physical resources and capital employed additionally leveraging existing facilities through capital effective organic growth and diversified product offerings allows us to maximize utilization of current cost structures 

secure supply of high quality justintime ferrous raw materials 

we maintain a secure supply of ferrous raw material resources through the benefit of our metals recycling operations and iron dynamics ferrous materials represent the single largest raw material component of our steel operations manufacturing costs excluding the techs representing 55 and 65 of such costs in 2015 and 2014 respectively during 2015 and 2014 our metals recycling operations omnisource provided our steel operations with 37 and 44 respectively of its ferrous scrap requirements based on volume this represented 54 and 48 of omnisources total ferrous scrap shipments during 2015 and 2014 respectively during 2015 and 2014 our steel operations consumed 88 and 76 million tons respectively of metallic materials of which iron units other than scrap represented approximately 12 and 9 in 2015 and 2014 respectively iron dynamics supplies 100 of its production to the butler flat roll division representing 66 and 62 of their iron units in 2015 and 2014 respectively through the transfer of liquid pig iron and hot briquetted iron which are higherquality energysaving ferrous raw materials we believe our metals recycling operations and 

iron dynamics provide us with a high quality cost effective and secure raw material platform for effective working capital management 

diversified product mix  expand product offerings

industry segments 

we have three reporting segments steel operations metals recycling operations and steel fabrication operations please refer to notes 1 and 13 in the notes to consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 of this form 10k for additional segment information including changes to our reporting segments that were effective beginning with the third quarter 2015 results 



steel operations consist of our six electric arc furnace steel mills producing steel from ferrous scrap and scrap substitutes utilizing continuous casting automated rolling mills and ten downstream steel coating lines and iron dynamics idi our liquid pig iron production facility that supplies solely the butler flat roll division our steel operations sell directly to end users steel fabricators and service centers these products are used in numerous industry sectors including the automotive construction manufacturing transportation heavy and agriculture equipment and pipe and tube including octg markets the most significant portion of our products is tied to the automotive construction and other manufacturing sectors our steel operations accounted for 69 63 and 61 of our consolidated net sales in 2015 2014 and 2013 respectively we are predominantly a domestic steel company with only 5 and 4 of our revenues generated from exported sales during 2015 and 2014 respectively 

our steel operations consist primarily of steelmaking and coating operations the following chart summarizes the locations and the current estimated production capacities of our facilities 



  



note capacities represent manufacturing capabilities based on mill configuration and related employee support these capacities do not represent expected volumes in a given year in addition estimates of mill capacity particularly rolling capacity are highly dependent on the specific product mix manufactured each of our mills can and do roll many different types and sizes of products therefore our capacity estimates assume a typical product mix 

the following chart summarizes our steel operations products and the percentage of sales tons by end market 

sheet products 

our sheet steel products consisting of hot roll cold roll and coated steel products are produced by butler and columbus flat roll divisions and our ten downstream coating lines our sheet operations represented 65 59 and 57 of steel operations net sales in 2015 2014 and 2013 respectively we produced the following sheet steel at these facilities tons 



the following chart summarizes the types of sheet products we sold during the respective years 

sheet steel product mix 

customers steel processors and service centers typically act as intermediaries between primary sheet steel producers and the many enduser manufacturers that require further processing of hot roll coils the additional processing performed by the intermediate steel processors and service centers include pickling galvanizing cutting to length slitting to size leveling blanking shape correcting edge rolling shearing and stamping we believe that our intermediate steel processor and service center customers will remain an integral part of our customer base columbus flat roll division allows us to capitalize on the industrial markets in the southern us and mexico as well as expand our customer base into line and other pipe products galvanized flat roll products produced by butler and columbus flat roll divisions and the techs are similar and are sold to a similar customer base however the techs specializes in the galvanizing of specific types of flat roll steels in generally nonautomotive applications servicing a variety of customers in the heating ventilation and air conditioning hvac construction agriculture and consumer goods markets our sheet steel operations also provide a significant portion of the sheet steel utilized in our steel fabrication operations 

the following chart summarizes the types of customers who purchased our sheet steel products during the respective years 

sheet steel customers 

competition our sheet steelmaking operations compete with domestic and foreign integrated and electric arc furnace based hot roll coil producers additionally the global steel industry suffers from overcapacity and that excess capacity in 2015 has resulted in steel manufacturers in certain countries exporting steel at prices that are lower than prevailing domestic prices and at or below their cost of production steel imports throughout 2015 and 2014 have been at record levels of 29 and 28 of us consumption respectively 

long products 

our structural and rail division is capable of producing a variety of parallel flange sections such as wide flange beams american standard beams manufactured housing beams h piling and channel sections for the construction transportation and industrial machinery markets they also produce standard strength carbon intermediate alloy hardness and premium grade rails in 40 to 320 feet lengths for the railroad industry our stateoftheart heat treating system allows us to produce highquality premium rail which has been certified by all but one class i railroads in addition our railwelding facility has the ability to weld rails to lengths of 1600 feet which offers substantial savings to the railroads both in terms of initial capital cost and through reduced maintenance our structural and rail division produced 12 million tons and 13 million tons during 2015 and 2014 respectively of which 269000 tons and 225000 tons respectively was rail production 

our engineered bar products division is capable of producing a broad array of engineered specialbarquality sbq merchantbarquality mbq roundedcornered squares and smallerdiameter engineered round bars the recently completed expansion of our smallerdiameter rolling mill increased the mills product offering into highquality smallerdiameter 1inch to 3inch precision sbq bars without this product diversification expansion production tons at this mill could have been significantly less due to the weak heavy equipment and agriculture markets in 2015 we produced 516000 tons and 670000 tons during 2015 and 2014 respectively at this facility adjacent to this mill we have a bar finishing facility with an annual capacity of 260000 tons which provides various downstream finishing operations for our sbq steel bars processing operations include turning polishing straightening chamfering precision sawcutting and heattreating capabilities in addition 

nondestructive testing services are available including eddy current flux leakage and ultrasonic inspection 

our roanoke bar division sells angles merchant rounds flats channels reinforcing bars and billets during 2015 and 2014 respectively roanoke bar division produced 536000 and 601000 tons of billets and 389000 tons and 432000 tons of finished steel products 

steel of west virginia primarily sells beams channels and specialty steel sections unlike most other mills steel of west virginia frequently performs fabrication and finishing operations on its products such as cutting to length additional straightening hole punching shot blasting welding and coating through this additional finishing we create custom finished products that are generally placed directly into our customers assembly operations we produced 295000 tons and 294000 tons of various merchant and structural steel products at steel of west virginia during 2015 and 2014 respectively 

customers the principal customers for our structural steel products are steel service centers steel fabricators and various manufacturers service centers though not the ultimate enduser provide valuable mill distribution functions to the fabricators and manufacturers including small quantity sales repackaging cutting preliminary processing and warehousing the steel rail marketplace in the united states canada and mexico is specialized and defined with seven class i railroads and a large distribution network we supply rail in 80 feet lengths and continuous welded rail cwr in lengths up to 1600 feet throughout north america 

sbq products are principally consumed by cold finishers forgers intermediate processors oem manufacturers steel service centers and distributors our mbq products are sold primarily to steel service centers as well as rebar distributors joist producers and oems some of the excess steel billet production at the roanoke bar division is sold to mills without sufficient melting capacities including our steel of west virginia facility our steel fabrication operations also purchase angles from roanoke bar division steel of west virginias customers are primarily oems producing truck trailers industrial lift trucks merchant products guardrail posts manufactured housing mining and offhighway construction equipment steel of west virginias flexible manufacturing capabilities enable us to meet demand for a variety of customordered and designed products many of these products are produced in small quantities for low volume end uses resulting in a wide variety of customers the largest of which are in the truck trailer and industrial lift truck industries 

competition our structural steel products compete with various electric arc furnace structural steelmakers some of which have cost structures and flexible management cultures similar to our own and we compete with alternative structural and manufacturing materials we also believe however that both geography and product choice play significant roles there are currently no other structural mills located in the midwest one of the largest structural steel consuming regions in the us and we provide customer service benefits to service centers fabricators and manufacturers located in the region we provide a broad product mix focusing on the midrange and larger sections served only by a few other competitors from locations more remote than our facility most of canadas structural steel consumption is located in canadas eastern provinces closer to us than our two largest competitors 

at present the rail market is principally served by two other domestic producers who have the capability to produce either standard or premium rail however they are limited to producing rail in 80 feet lengths and do not own welding operations we can produce rail in lengths up to 320 feet and weld to lengths of 1600 feet requiring far fewer welds for our rail customers there are currently no rail producers in canada or mexico global competitors include high quality integrated and electric arc furnace steel producers in europe and asia 

our engineered bar division competes with a number of other domestic producers of sbq and mbq we are among the largest and most diversified suppliers of engineered sbq in north america our customer service centralized geographic location justintime delivery and vendor management 

inventory program further differentiates us from other suppliers roanoke bar division competes primarily with several domestic steel manufactures steel west virginia competes in the specialty shape products market with other domestic and european operations by being able to provide small quantity niche products unique to our customer manufacturing capabilities 

iron dynamics idi 

idi produces liquid pig iron and hot briquetted iron hbi that serves as a substitute for a portion of the metallic raw material mix that goes directly into our butler flat roll division electric arc furnaces to produce steel direct reduced iron dri is a metallic product made from mill scale and other iron waste products that have been reduced in a rotary hearth furnace using natural gas and coal the reduction method employed by idi uses coal as the reducing agent the dri is either compacted by briquetters to form hbi or is processed further to produce liquid pig iron hbi can be immediately used in our melting furnaces or stockpiled for later use liquid pig iron is tapped from idis submerged arc furnace and immediately transferred in ladles to the adjacent butler flat roll division mill where it is combined with ferrous scrap in their electric arc furnaces 

idis primary focus is to maximize liquid pig iron production due to the inherent economic benefits achieved at the steel mill when the material is used in the steelmaking process such as reduced energy cost reduced materials cost and quicker melting cycles during 2015 and 2014 respectively idi produced 245000 and 250000 metric tons of which 98 and 93 was liquid pig iron we have used and plan to continue to use all of the facilitys output internally 



the metals recycling operations consists solely of omnisource and includes both ferrous and nonferrous scrap metal processing transportation marketing brokerage and consulting services in approximately 75 locations strategically located primarily in the midwest and southeast portion of the united states in addition omnisource designs installs and manages customized scrap management programs for industrial manufacturing companies at over 600 locations throughout north america our metals recycling operations accounted for 19 25 and 31 of our consolidated net sales in 2015 2014 and 2013 respectively our steel mills utilize a portion of the ferrous scrap processed through omnisource as raw material in our steelmaking operations and the remainder is sold to other consumers such as other steel manufacturers and foundries this strategic symbiotic relationship with our own steelmaking operations provides valuable pullthrough demand to omnisources ferrous scrap operations in 2015 2014 and 2013 omnisource supplied our steel mills with approximately 37 44 and 45 respectively of the tons of their ferrous raw material requirements representing approximately 54 48 and 44 respectively of omnisources 2015 2014 and 2013 ferrous shipped tons 

omnisource sold approximately 51 million gross tons and 56 million gross tons of ferrous material during 2015 and 2014 respectively and approximately 11 billion pounds and 12 billion pounds of nonferrous material during 2015 and 2014 respectively during 2015 and 2014 approximately 8 and 7 respectively of omnisources revenue were from export sales primarily from nonferrous materials 

we sell various grades of processed ferrous scrap primarily to steel mills and foundries ferrous scrap metal is the primary raw material for electric arc furnaces such as our steel mills in addition we sell various grades of nonferrous metals such as copper brass aluminum and stainless steel to aluminum steel and ingot manufacturers brass and bronze ingot makers copper refineries and mills smelters specialty mills alloy manufacturers and other consumers 

we purchase ferrous and nonferrous scrap metals processed and unprocessed in a variety of forms for our metals recycling facilities 

ferrous scrap comes from two primary sources 

• manufacturers and industrial plants metal fabrication plants machine shops and factories which generate ferrous scrap referred to as prompt or industrial scrap and • scrap dealers retail individuals auto wreckers demolition firms and others who generate steel and iron scrap referred to as obsolete scrap obsolete scrap includes postconsumer waste demolition of steel structures and automobiles and represents a significant source of scrap generation nonferrous scrap comes from three primary sources 

• manufacturers and other nonferrous scrap sources which generate or sell scrap aluminum copper stainless steel and other nonferrous metals • producers of electric wire telecommunication service providers aerospace defense and recycling companies that generate nonferrous scrap consisting primarily of copper wire aluminum beverage cans and various other metals and alloys and • retail individuals who sell material directly to our facilities which they collect from a variety of sources we do not purchase a significant amount of scrap metal from a single source or from a limited number of major sources market demand and the composition quality size weight and location of the materials are the primary factors that determine prices 

products our metals recycling operations primarily involve the purchase processing and resale of ferrous and nonferrous scrap metals into reusable forms and grades we process an array of ferrous products through a variety of methods including sorting shredding shearing cutting torching baling briquetting and breaking our major ferrous products include heavy melting steel busheling bundled scrap shredded scrap and other scrap metal products such as steel turnings and cast iron these products vary in properties or attributes related to cleanness size of individual pieces and residual alloys the necessary characteristics of the ferrous products are determined by the specific needs and requirements of the consumer and affect the individual products relative value in addition we process various grades of nonferrous products including aluminum brass copper stainless steel and other nonferrous metals additionally we provide transportation logistics truck rail and river barge management services marketing brokerage and consulting services related to the scrap industry 

customers we sell various grades of processed ferrous scrap to endusers such as electric arc furnace steel mills integrated steelmakers foundries secondary smelters and metal brokers who aggregate materials for other large users ferrous scrap metal is the primary raw material for electric arc furnaces such as our steel mills most of our ferrous scrap customers purchase processed scrap through negotiated spot sales contracts which establish a quantity purchase for the month the price we charge for ferrous scrap depends upon market demand and pricing transportation costs as well as the quality and grade of the scrap we sell various grades of processed nonferrous scrap to endusers such as aluminum sheet and ingot manufacturers brass and bronze ingot makers copper refineries mills smelters specialty steelmakers alloy manufacturers wire and cable producers utilities and telephone networks the price we charge for nonferrous scrap depends upon market demand and pricing transportation costs as well as the quality and grade of the scrap 

competition scrap is a global commodity influenced by conditions in a number of industrialized and emergingmarkets throughout asia europe and north america the markets for scrap metals are highly competitive both in the purchase of raw or unprocessed scrap and the sale of processed scrap 

with regard to the purchase of raw scrap we compete with numerous independent recyclers as well as smaller scrap companies engaged only in collecting obsolete scrap in many cases we also purchase unprocessed scrap metal from smaller scrap dealers and other processors successful procurement of materials is determined primarily by the price offered by the purchaser for the raw scrap and the proximity of our processing facility to the source of the raw scrap both ferrous and nonferrous scrap sells as a commodity in both national and international markets which are affected sometimes significantly by relative economic conditions currency fluctuations and the availability and cost of transportation competition for sales of processed scrap is based primarily on the price quality and location of the scrap metals as well as the level of service provided in terms of reliability and timing of delivery 

we also face potential competition for sales of processed scrap from other producers of steel products such as electric arc furnace and integrated steel mills some of which are also vertically integrated in the scrap metals recycling business in addition other steel mills may compete with us in attempting to secure scrap supply through direct purchasing from our scrap suppliers scrap metal processors also face competition from substitutes for prepared ferrous scrap such as prereduced iron pellets hot briquetted iron pig iron dri and other forms of processed iron the availability and relative prices of substitutes for ferrous scrap could result in a decreased demand for processed ferrous scrap and could result in lower prices andor lower demand for our scrap products 

the industry is highly fragmented with many smaller familyowned companies many regional scrap companies along with a number of national and global companies each of which has multiple locations in areas in which omnisource also operates no single scrap metals recycler has a significant market share in the domestic market 

during the fourth quarter of 2015 we determined that the fair market value of omnisource operations was less than its carrying value due to the weak global scrap commodity outlook and thus impaired as a result we recorded 4285 million in pretax noncash asset impairment charges related to goodwill trade name and other related assets 



our steel fabrication operations include eight new millennium building systems plants that primarily serve the nonresidential construction industry located in butler indiana lake city florida salem virginia hope arkansas juarez mexico and fallon nevada and memphis tennessee and phoenix arizona which were acquired from csi on september 14 2015 we have established a national operating footprint that allows us to serve the entire us construction market as well as national accounts such as large retail chains 

steel fabrication operations accounted for 9 7 and 6 of our consolidated net sales during 2015 2014 and 2013 respectively we sold 493000 tons and 481000 tons of joist and deck products during 2015 and 2014 respectively our steel operations supply a substantial portion approximately 63 and 51 in 2015 and 2014 respectively of the steel utilized in our steel fabrication operations providing strategic pullthrough demand 

products our steel fabrication operations produce steel building components including steel joists girders trusses six locations and steel deck six locations our joist products include bowstring arched scissor doublepitched and singlepitched joists our deck products include a full range of steel roof form and composite floor deck and with the 2015 addition of our tennessee and arizona plants our product offerings were further expanded to include specialty architectural deck floor systems and bridge deck 

customers our primary steel fabrication operations customers are nonresidential steel fabricators other customers include metal building companies general construction contractors developers brokers and governmental entities our customers are located throughout the united states including national accounts 

markets our steel fabrication operations primarily serve the nonresidential construction industry the steel joist and deck market in the us was approximately 17 million tons in 2015 and 2014 an increase from 15 million tons in 2013 based on trade association estimates based on this information our steel fabrication operations growth rate has outpaced the steel joist and deck market growth resulting in our increasing market share of approximately 31 30 and 27 in 2015 2014 and 2013 respectively we believe we are well positioned with our expanding national footprint to continue to grow as the nonresidential construction market continues to be strong and we have available capacity that can be deployed as needed 

competition we compete with other north american joist and steel deck producers primarily on the basis of price quality customer service and proximity to the customer our expanding national footprint allows us to service the entire us nonresidential construction market as well as national accounts such as large retail chains and certain specialty deck customers 



other operations consists of subsidiary operations that are below the quantitative thresholds required for reportable segments and primarily consist of our minnesota ironmaking operations and several smaller joint ventures our minnesota ironmaking operations consists of our iron nugget production facility mesabi nugget owned 82 by us our iron concentrating operations mesabi mining and our iron tailings operations mining resources owned 81 by us also included in other are certain unallocated corporate accounts such as the companys senior secured credit facility senior notes certain other investments and certain profit sharing expenses 

during the fourth quarter of 2014 our minnesota ironmaking operations reached a steady operating state indicating a consistency in the operations production capability processes and cost structure including the ability to utilize certain lowercost raw materials given this we undertook an assessment of the recoverability of the carrying value of our minnesota ironmaking operations fixed assets given our outlook at that time regarding future operating costs and product pricing we concluded that the carrying value of these fixed assets was no longer fully recoverable and the fixed assets were in fact impaired this assessment resulted in a 2600 million pretax noncash impairment charge including amounts attributable to noncontrolling interests of 465 million please refer to note 1 in the notes to consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 of this form 10k for information regarding the asset impairment charge given the significant and sustained decline in pig iron pricing which resulted in the cost of iron nugget production to be meaningfully higher than product selling prices management and the board of directors elected to indefinitely idle the minnesota ironmaking operations in may 2015 upon that decision and the decision to monetize existing raw material inventory we recorded an inventory lowerofcost or market charge of 210 million inclusive of noncontrolling interests of 36 million in cost of goods sold in the second quarter 2015 operating losses associated with our minnesota ironmaking operations have been significantly curtailed postidling 

sources availability and cost of steel and other operations raw materials 

scrap metals the principal raw material of our steel operations is scrap metal derived from among other sources home scrap generated internally at steel mills themselves industrial scrap generated as a byproduct of manufacturing and obsolete scrap recycled from endoflife automobiles appliances railroad cars and railroad track materials agricultural machinery and demolition scrap from obsolete structures containers and machines 

ferrous scrap typically comprises more than 80 of the metallic melt mix in electric arc furnace steelmaking in contrast to integrated mill steelmaking where the proportion of scrap has traditionally been approximately 25 to 35 depending upon the scrap substitute material that may be available from time to time and the relative cost of such material the percentage of scrap used in our steelmaking operations could be increased or reduced in our metallic melt mix 

many variables can impact ferrous scrap prices all of which reflect the pushes and pulls of the supply demand equation these factors include the level of us steel production for highquality lowresidual scrap is a byproduct of steel manufacturing activity the level of exports of scrap from the united states and the amount of obsolete scrap production generally as domestic steel demand increases so does scrap demand and resulting scrap prices the reverse is also normally but not always true with scrap prices following steel prices downward when supply exceeds demand in 2015 domestic steel mill utilization and steel pricing was negatively impacted by record levels of steel imports resulting in lower demand for scrap forcing ferrous pricing downward throughout the year 

the price of ferrous scrap as a commodity has tended to be volatile rising and falling with supply and not always in lock step with or in proportion to the market price of steel in addition domestic ferrous scrap prices generally have a strong correlation and spread to global pig iron pricing scrap prices declined sharply in 2015 due to domestic scrap competition the strong us dollar tempering scrap exports lower steel mill utilization rates resulting from excessive steel imports and decreasing global pig iron prices when scrap prices greatly accelerate this challenges one of the principal elements of an electric arc furnace based steel mills traditional lower cost structure—the cost of its metallic raw material 

the following table provides pricing per gross ton from american metal market amm and ryans notes pig iron estimates for ferrous materials used in steel production 

ferrous material pricing 

iron units in addition to scrap dri hot briquetted iron pig iron and iron nuggets are used in our electric arc furnace steel mill production during 2015 and 2014 we consumed 88 million tons and 76 million tons respectively of metallic materials in our steelmaking furnaces of which iron units other than scrap represented approximately 12 and 9 of the tons in 2015 and 2014 respectively of these iron substitute units consumed our iron dynamics operations supplies 100 of its production to the butler flat roll division mill representing 66 and 62 of their iron units in 2015 and 2014 respectively

electricity electricity is a significant input required in the electric arc furnaces in our steelmaking operations excluding the techs representing 6 and 5 of steel production costs of goods sold in 2015 and 2014 respectively we have entered into a fixed price interruptible electricity supply agreement that extends through december 31 2017 for the butler flat roll division the contract allows our supplier to interrupt service in the event of an emergency or in response to various market conditions columbus flat roll division roanoke bar division and steel of west virginia have each entered into fixed price contracts while our engineered bar products division has a combination of fixed pricing and market pricing for the various components of the electrical services demand charge energy charge riders etc our structural and rail division purchases electricity at current market prices and through forward contracts at fixed prices 

natural gas we purchase a portion of our steelmaking operations natural gas requirements at market prices and a portion by entering into hedging transactions on the futures markets for ultimate physical delivery in order to help minimize price volatility these contracts typically have duration of up to 24 months but on occasion may extend further natural gas represented 13 and 15 of steelmaking operations excluding the techs costs of goods sold in 2015 and 2014 respectively 

patents and trademarks 

we currently do not own any material patents or patent applications for technologies that are in use in our production processes we have seven major registered trademarks as follows 

• the mark sdi and a chevron alone • the mark sdi and a chevron and steel dynamics inc to the right of the chevron • the mark sdi and a chevron and steel dynamics to the right of the chevron • the mark omnisource corporation with the circle logo design • the slogan the best in metals recycling • the mark the techs and • the mark new millennium building systems llc research and development 

our research and development activities have consisted of efforts to develop or improve our products and operating processes and our efforts to develop and improve alternative ironmaking technologies through iron dynamics and prior to idling our minnesota ironmaking operations most of these research and development efforts have been conducted inhouse by our employees 

environmental matters 

our operations are subject to substantial and evolving local state and federal environmental health and safety laws and regulations concerning among other things emissions to the air discharges 

to surface and ground water and to sewer systems and the generation handling storage transportation treatment and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes our manufacturing operations are dependent upon permits regulating discharges into the air or into the water or the use and handling of byproducts in order to operate our facilities we dedicate considerable resources aimed at achieving material compliance with federal and state laws concerning the environment while we do not currently believe that our future compliance efforts with such provisions will have a material adverse effect on our results of operations cash flows or financial condition this is subject to change in the evolving regulatory environment in which we operate 

since the level of enforcement of environmental laws and regulations or the nature of those laws that may be enacted from time to time are subject to changing social or political pressures our environmental capital expenditures and costs for environmental compliance may increase in the future in addition due to the possibility of unanticipated regulatory or other developments the amount and timing of future environmental expenditures may vary substantially from those currently anticipated the cost of current and future environmental compliance may also place us steel producers at a competitive disadvantage with respect to foreign steel producers which may not be required to undertake equivalent costs in their operations 

pursuant to the resource conservation and recovery act or rcra which governs the treatment handling and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes the united states environmental protection agency or us epa and authorized state environmental agencies may conduct inspections to identify areas where there may have been releases of solid or hazardous constituents into the environment and require the facilities to take corrective action to remediate any such releases rcra also allows citizens to bring certain suits against regulated facilities for potential damages and cleanup our steelmaking and certain other facilities generate wastes subject to rcra our manufacturing operations produce various byproducts some of which for example electric arc furnace or eaf dust are categorized as solid or hazardous waste requiring special handling for disposal or for the recovery of metallics we collect such byproducts in pollution controlled equipment such as baghouses and either recycle or dispose of these byproducts while we cannot predict the future actions of the regulators or other interested parties the potential exists for required corrective action at these facilities the costs of which could be substantial 

under the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act or cercla the us epa and in some instances private parties have the authority to impose joint and several liability for the remediation of contaminated properties upon generators of waste current and former site owners and operators transporters and other potentially responsible parties regardless of fault or the legality of the original disposal activity many states have statutes and regulatory authorities similar to cercla and to the us epa we have a number of material handling agreements with various contractors to properly dispose of or recycle our electric arc furnace dust and certain other byproducts of our operations however we cannot assure that even if there has been no fault by us we may not still be cited as a waste generator by reason of an environmental cleanup at a site to which our byproducts were transported 

the clean water act and similar state laws apply to aspects of our operations and impose regulatory burdens related to the discharge of wastewater stormwater and dredged or fill material us epa states and in certain instances private parties have the ability to bring suit alleging violations and seeking penalties and damages the clean water acts provisions can require new or expanded water treatment investments to be made and can limit or even prohibit certain current or planned activities at our operations 

the clean air act and analogous state laws require many of our facilities to obtain and maintain air permits in order to operate air permits can impose new or expanded obligations to limit or prevent current or future emissions and to add costly pollution control equipment enforcement can be brought 

by us epa the states and in certain instance private parties and can result in large penalties and injunctive relief 

in addition there are a number of other environmental health and safety laws and regulations that apply to our facilities and may affect our operations by way of example and not of limitation certain portions of the federal toxic substances control act oil pollution act safe drinking water act and emergency planning and community righttoknow act as well as state and local laws and regulations implemented by the regulatory agencies apply to aspects of our facilities operations many of these laws allow both the governments and citizens to bring certain suits against regulated facilities for alleged environmental violations finally any steelmaking and metals recycling company could be subject to certain toxic tort suits brought by citizens or other third parties alleging causes of action such as nuisance negligence trespass infliction of emotional distress or other claims alleging personal injury or property damage 

employees 

we emphasize decentralized decisionmaking and responsibility and have established performancebased incentive compensation programs specifically designed to enhance productivity improve profitability control costs and foster innovation our work force consisted of approximately 7500 full time employees at december 31 2015 of which approximately 9 were represented by collective bargaining agreements the largest group of unionized employees is at steel of west virginia the remaining unionized employees are located in five different omnisource metals recycling locations each of which has its own agreement we believe that our relationship with our employees is good

 item 1a risk factors 

many factors could have an effect on our financial condition cash flows and results of operations we are subject to various risks resulting from changing economic environmental political industry business and financial conditions the factors described below represent our principal risks 

risks related to our industry 

our industry is affected by domestic and global economic factors including the slower than anticipated and uneven recovery from the recent recession and the risk of a new recession 

our financial results are substantially dependent not only upon overall economic conditions in the united states in europe and in asia but also as they may affect one or more of the industries upon which we depend for the sale of our products the slower than anticipated and uneven recovery from the recent recession could stifle improving customer confidence and adversely affect demand for our products and further adversely affect our business metals industries have historically been vulnerable to significant declines in consumption and product pricing during periods of economic downturn or continued uncertainty including the pace of domestic nonresidential construction activity 

our business is also dependent upon certain industries such as automotive construction manufacturing transportation heavy and agriculture equipment and pipe and tube including octg markets and these industries are also cyclical in nature therefore these industries may experience their own fluctuations in demand for our products based on such things as economic conditions energy prices consumer demand and infrastructure funding decisions by governments many of these factors are beyond our control as a result of volatility in our industry or in the industries we serve we may have difficulty increasing or maintaining our level of sales or profitability if the industries we serve were to suffer a downturn then our business may be adversely affected 

our level of production and our sales and earnings are subject to significant fluctuations as a result of the cyclical nature of the steel industry and some of the industries we serve 

the steel manufacturing business is cyclical in nature and the selling price of the steel we make may fluctuate significantly due to many factors beyond our control furthermore many of our products are commodities subject to their own cyclical fluctuations in supply and demand in both metal consuming and metal generating industries including the construction industry the timing magnitude and duration of these cycles and the resulting price fluctuations are difficult to predict the sale of our manufactured steel products is directly affected by demand for our products in other cyclical industries such as automotive construction manufacturing transportation heavy and agriculture equipment and pipe and tube including octg markets economic difficulties stagnant global economies supplydemand imbalances and currency fluctuations in the united states or globally could decrease the demand for our products or increase the amount of imports of steel into the united states which could decrease our sales margins and profitability 

the scrap metal recycling industry has historically been and is expected to remain highly cyclical and this could have a material adverse effect on our metals recycling operations results 

scrap metal prices have become increasingly volatile and operating results within the metals recycling industry in general have historically been cyclical and are expected to remain highly cyclical in nature similarly but not necessarily paralleling the price fluctuations in the steel business the purchase prices for automobile bodies and various other grades of obsolete and industrial scrap as well as the selling prices for processed and recycled scrap metals we utilize in our own manufacturing process or which we resell to others through our metals recycling operations are also highly volatile during periods of increased imports scrap metal prices may become depressed and adversely affect the sales profitability and margins of our scrap business as a metals recycler we may attempt to respond 

to changing recycled metal selling prices by adjusting the scrap metal purchase prices we pay to others but our ability to do this may be limited by competitive or other factors during periods of low scrap prices when inbound scrap flow may slow considerably as scrap generators hold on to their scrap in hopes of getting higher prices later as such a prolonged period of low scrap prices could reduce our ability to obtain process and sell recycled materials and this could adversely affect our metals recycling operations results due to the weak global scrap commodity outlook during the fourth quarter of 2015 as a part of our annual goodwill and indefinitelived intangible asset assessment it was determined that the fair market value of our metals recycling operations was less than its carrying value this led to the determination that the book value of the metals recycling operations was impaired resulting in pretax noncash asset impairment charges related to goodwill trade name and other assets of 4285 million conversely periodic increased foreign demand for scrap can result in an outflow of available domestic scrap as well as resulting higher scrap prices domestically that cannot always be passed on to domestic scrap consumers thereby further reducing available domestic scrap flows and scrap margins all of which could adversely affect our sales and profitability of our scrap business additionally during periods of high demand and resulting higher scrap prices ferrous scrap consumers may seek and develop ferrous scrap alternatives including pig iron and direct reduced iron the availability and pricing of these scrap alternatives in the domestic market may have a longer term impact on scrap pricing particularly in prime grades which could adversely affect our sales profitability and margins 

imports of steel into the united states have adversely affected and may again adversely affect united states steel prices which could impact our sales margins and profitability 

global steelmaking capacity currently exceeds global consumption of steel products such excess capacity sometimes results in steel manufacturers in certain countries exporting steel at prices that are lower than prevailing domestic prices and sometimes at or below their cost of production excessive imports of steel into the united states such as in 2015 and 2014 have exerted and may continue to exert downward pressure on us steel prices which negatively affects our ability to increase our sales margins and profitability this may also adversely impact domestic demand for ferrous scrap and our ferrous metallics margins us steel producers compete with many foreign producers including those in china competition from foreign producers is typically strong and is periodically exacerbated by weakening of the economies of certain foreign steelmaking countries a higher volume of steel exports to the us tend to occur at depressed prices when steel producing countries experience periods of economic difficulty decreased demand for steel products or excess capacity 

in addition we believe the downward pressure on and periodically depressed levels of us steel prices in recent years have been further exacerbated by imports of steel involving dumping and subsidy abuses by foreign steel producers some foreign steel producers are owned controlled or subsidized by foreign governments as a result decisions by these producers with respect to their production sales and pricing are sometimes influenced to a greater degree by political and economic policy considerations than by prevailing market conditions realities of the marketplace or consideration of profit or loss however while some tariffs and quotas have recently been put into effect for certain steel products imported from a number of countries that have been found to have been unfairly pricing steel imports to the us there is no assurance that tariffs and quotas will always be levied even if otherwise justified and even when imposed many of these are only shortlived when such tariffs or duties expire or if others are further relaxed or repealed or if relatively higher us steel prices make it attractive for foreign steelmakers to export their steel products to the us despite the presence of duties or tariffs the resurgence of substantial imports of foreign steel could create downward pressure on us steel prices 

chinas current steelmaking overcapacity in relation to its steel consumption could have a material adverse effect on domestic and global steel pricing and could result in increased steel imports into the united states 

the significant growth of new chinese steel production capacity that began in the 2000s coupled with the slowdown in chinese steel consumption has resulted in chinese steel production capacity that far exceeds that countrys current demand and has made china a major global exporter of steel this combination of a slowdown in chinas economic growth and steel consumption and its own expansion of steelmaking capacity generally results in a weakening of steel pricing should chinese steelmaking capacity remain the same or further increase in relation to its demand china might not only remain a net exporter of steel but many asian and european steel producers whose steel output previously fed chinas steel import needs could redirect their steel into the us market through increased steel imports causing a further erosion of margins or negatively impacting our ability to increase our prices 

the recent global economic downturn and the difficult conditions in the global industrial capital and credit markets that resulted have adversely affected and may continue to adversely affect our industry as well as the industries of many of our customers and suppliers upon whom we are dependent 

many of the markets in which our customers participate such as automotive construction manufacturing transportation heavy and agriculture equipment and pipe and tube including octg markets are cyclical in nature and experience significant fluctuations in demand for our steel products based on economic conditions consumer demand raw material and energy costs and decisions by our government to fund or not fund infrastructure projects such as highways bridges schools energy plants railroads and transportation facilities many of these factors are beyond our control these markets are highly competitive to a large extent driven by enduse markets and may experience overcapacity all of which may affect demand for and pricing of our products 

a decline in consumer and business confidence and spending together with reductions in the availability of credit or increased cost of credit as well as volatility in the capital and credit markets could adversely affect the business and economic environment in which we operate and the profitability of our business we are also exposed to risks associated with the creditworthiness of our suppliers and customers if the availability of credit to fund or support the continuation and expansion of our customers business operations is curtailed or if the cost of that credit is increased the resulting inability of our customers or of their customers to access either credit or absorb the increased cost of that credit could adversely affect our business by reducing our sales or by increasing our exposure to losses from uncollectible customer accounts a renewed disruption of the credit markets could also result in financial instability of some of our suppliers and customers the consequences of such adverse effects could include the interruption of production at the facilities of our customers the reduction delay or cancellation of customer orders delays or interruptions of the supply of raw materials we purchase and bankruptcy of customers suppliers or other creditors any of these events may adversely affect our profitability cash flow and financial condition 

volatility and major fluctuations in scrap metal and pig iron prices and our potential inability to pass higher costs on to our customers may constrain operating levels and reduce profit margins 

steel producers require large amounts of raw materials including scrap metal and scrap substitute products such as pig iron pelletized iron and other supplies such as graphite electrodes and ferroalloys our principal raw material is scrap metal derived primarily from junked automobiles industrial scrap railroad cars railroad track materials agricultural machinery and demolition scrap from obsolete structures containers and machines the prices for scrap are subject to market forces largely beyond our control including demand by us and international steel producers freight costs and speculation the prices for scrap have varied significantly may vary significantly in the future and do not necessarily fluctuate in tandem with the price of steel moreover some of our integrated steel producer competitors are not as dependent as we are on scrap as a part of their raw material melt mix which 

during periods of high scrap costs relative to the cost of blast furnace iron used by the integrated producers give them a raw material cost advantage over minimills while our vertical integration into the metals recycling business through our omnisource operations and into the ironmaking business through our iron dynamics facility should enable us to continue being a costeffective supplier to our steelmaking operations for some of our metallics requirements we will still need to rely on other metallics and raw material suppliers as well as upon general industry supply conditions for the balance of our needs the idling of our minnesota ironmaking operations in may 2015 may hinder or delay our ability to be a costeffective supplier to our steelmaking operations during periods of high raw material costs 

purchase prices for auto bodies scrap metal and scrap substitute products such as pig iron that we consume and selling prices for scrap and recycled metals that we sell to third parties are volatile and beyond our control while omnisource attempts to respond to changing recycled metal selling prices through adjustments to its metal purchase prices its ability to do so is limited by competitive and other market factors changing prices could potentially impact the volume of scrap metal available to us and the volume and realized margins of processed metals we sell 

the availability and prices of raw materials may also be negatively affected by new laws and regulations allocation by suppliers interruptions in production accidents or natural disasters changes in exchange rates global price fluctuations and the availability and cost of transportation 

if prices for ferrous metallics increase by a greater margin than corresponding price increases for the sale of our steel products we may not be able to recoup such cost increases from increases in the selling prices of steel products conversely depressed prices for ferrous scrap may constrain its supply which may adversely affect our metals recycling operations and also the availability of certain grades of scrap for our steelmaking operations additionally our inability to pass on all or any substantial part of any cost increases during periods of rapidly rising scrap prices through scrap or other surcharges or to provide for our customers needs because of the potential unavailability of key raw materials or other inputs may result in production curtailments or may otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations or prospects 

the cost and availability of electricity and natural gas are also subject to volatile market conditions 

steel producers like us consume large amounts of energy inasmuch as minimills melt ferrous scrap in electric arc furnaces and use natural gas to reheat steel or steel billets for rolling into finished products we rely on third parties for the supply of energy resources we consume in our steelmaking activities the prices for and availability of electricity natural gas oil and other energy resources are also subject to volatile market conditions often affected by weather conditions as well as political and economic factors beyond our control as large consumers of electricity and gas we must have dependable delivery in order to operate accordingly we are at risk in the event of an energy disruption prolonged blackouts or brownouts or disruptions caused by natural disasters or by political considerations would substantially disrupt our production in addition a significant portion of our finished steel products are delivered by truck unforeseen fluctuations in the price of fuel attributable to fluctuations in crude oil prices would also have a negative impact on our costs or on the costs of many of our customers in addition changes in certain environmental regulations in the us including those that may impose output limitations or higher costs associated with climate change or greenhouse gas emissions legislation could substantially increase the cost of manufacturing and raw materials such as energy to us and other us steel producers 

fluctuations in the value of the united states dollar relative to other currencies may adversely affect our business 

fluctuations in the value of the dollar can be expected to affect our business a strong us dollar such as was experienced in 2015 makes imported products less expensive potentially resulting in more imports of steel products into the us by our foreign competitors while a weak us dollar may have the opposite impact on imports 

compliance with and changes in environmental and remediation requirements could result in substantially increased capital requirements and operating costs 

existing laws or regulations as currently interpreted or as may be interpreted in the future as well as future laws or regulations may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

we are subject to comprehensive local state federal and international statutory and regulatory environmental requirements relating to among other things 

• the acceptance storage treatment handling and disposal of solid and hazardous waste • the discharge of materials into the air including periodic changes to the national ambient air quality standards and to emission standards • the management and treatment of wastewater and storm water • the remediation of soil and groundwater contamination • global climate change legislation or regulation • the need for and the ability to timely obtain air water or other operating permits • the timely reporting of certain chemical usage content storage and releases • the remediation and reclamation of land used for iron mining • natural resource damages and • the protection of our employees health and safety compliance with environmental laws and regulations which affect our steelmaking metals recycling and ironmaking operations is a significant factor in our business we are required to obtain and comply with environmental permits and licenses and failure to obtain or renew or the violation of any permit or license could result in substantial fines and penalties suspension of operations andor the closure of a subject facility similarly delays increased costs andor the imposition of onerous conditions to the securing or renewal of operating permits could have a material adverse effect on these operations 

private parties might also bring claims against us under citizen suit provisions andor for alleged property damage or personal injury resulting from the environmental impacts of our operations moreover legal requirements change frequently are subject to interpretation and have tended to become more stringent over time uncertainty regarding adequate pollution control levels testing and sampling procedures and new pollution control technology are factors that may increase our future compliance expenditures we are unable to predict the ultimate cost of future compliance with these requirements or their effect on our operations although we work hard to be in substantial compliance with all applicable laws and regulations legal requirements frequently change and are subject to interpretation new laws regulations and changing interpretations by regulatory authorities together with uncertainty regarding adequate pollution control levels testing and sampling procedures and evolving pollution control technology are among the factors that may increase our future expenditures 

to comply with environmental requirements the cost of complying with existing laws or regulations as currently interpreted or reinterpreted in the future or with future laws or regulations may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

our manufacturing and metals recycling operations produce significant amounts of byproducts some of which are handled as solid or hazardous waste for example our mills generate electric arc furnace eaf dust which the united states environmental protection agency us epa and other regulatory authorities classify as hazardous waste and regulate accordingly 

in addition the primary feed materials for the shredders operated by our metals recycling operations include automobile hulks and obsolete household appliances a portion of the feed materials consist of unrecyclable material known as shredder residue if laws or regulations the interpretation of the laws or regulations or testing methods change with regard to eaf dust or shredder residue we may incur significant additional expenditures 

the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act cercla or superfund enables the us epa state agencies and certain private parties to recover from owners operators generators and transporters the cost of investigation and cleanup of sites at which hazardous substances were disposed in connection with cercla and analogous state laws we may be required to clean up contamination discovered at our sites including contamination that may have been caused by former owners or operators of the sites to conduct additional cleanup at sites that have already had some cleanup performed andor to perform cleanup with regard to sites formerly used in connection with our operations 

in addition we may be required to pay for or to pay a portion of the costs of cleanup at sites to which we sent materials for disposal or recycling notwithstanding that the original disposal or recycling activity may have complied with all regulatory requirements then in effect pursuant to cercla a party can be held jointly and severally liable for all of the cleanup costs associated with a disposal site in practice a liable party often splits the costs of cleanup with other potentially responsible parties we have received notices from the us epa state agencies and third parties that we have been identified as potentially responsible for the cost of investigating and cleaning up a number of disposal sites in most cases many other parties are also named as potentially responsible parties 

because cercla can be imposed retroactively on shipments that occurred many years ago and because the us epa and state agencies are still discovering sites that pose a threat to public health or the environment we can provide no assurance that we will not become liable for significant costs associated with investigation and remediation of cercla cleanup sites 

cercla including the superfund recycling equity act of 1999 limits the exposure of scrap metal recyclers for sales of certain recyclable material under certain circumstances however the recycling defense is subject to a number of limitations and may be found not to apply to all instances of recycling activity that we conduct 

increased regulation associated with climate change and greenhouse gas emissions could impose significant additional costs on both our steelmaking and metals recycling operations 

the united states government or various governmental agencies may introduce additional regulatory changes in response to the potential impacts of climate change international treaties or agreements may also result in increasing regulation of greenhouse gas emissions including the introduction of carbon emissions trading mechanisms any such regulation regarding climate change and greenhouse gas or ghg emissions could impose significant costs on our steelmaking and metals recycling operations and on the operations of our customers and suppliers including increased energy capital equipment environmental monitoring and reporting and other costs in order to comply with current or future laws or regulations concerning and limitations imposed on our operations by virtue of 

climate change and ghg emissions laws and regulations any adopted future climate change and ghg regulations could negatively impact our ability and that of our customers and suppliers to compete with companies situated in areas not subject to such limitations 

from a medium and longterm perspective we are likely to see an increase in costs relating to our assets that emit significant amounts of greenhouse gases as a result of these regulatory initiatives these regulatory initiatives may impact our operations directly or through our suppliers or customers until the timing scope and extent of any future regulation becomes known we cannot predict the effect on our financial condition operating performance and ability to compete 

risks related to the business 

our senior secured credit facility contains and any future financing agreements may contain restrictive covenants that may limit our flexibility 

restrictions and covenants in our existing debt agreements including our senior secured credit facility and any future financing agreements may impair our ability to finance future operations or capital needs or to engage in other business activities specifically these agreements may limit or restrict our ability to 

• incur additional indebtedness • pay dividends or make distributions with respect to our capital stock in excess of certain amounts • repurchase or redeem capital stock • make some investments • create liens on property • make some capital expenditures • enter into transactions with affiliates or related persons • issue or sell stock of certain subsidiaries • sell or transfer assets and • enter into mergers acquisitions or consolidations or some joint ventures a breach of any of the restrictions or covenants could cause a default under our senior secured credit facility our senior notes or our other debt a significant portion of our indebtedness then may become immediately due and payable if the default is not remedied 

under our senior secured credit facility we are required to maintain certain financial covenants tied to our leverage and profitability our ability to meet such covenants or other restrictions can be affected by events beyond our control if a default were to occur the lenders could elect to declare all amounts then outstanding to be immediately due and payable and terminate all commitments to extend further credit if we are unable to repay those amounts the lenders could proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure such indebtedness we have pledged substantially all of our receivables and inventories and all shares of capital stock or other equity interests of our subsidiaries and intercompany debt held by us as collateral for our senior secured credit facility 

we may face significant price and other forms of competition from other steel producers scrap processors and alternative materials which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operation or prospects 

the global markets in which steel companies and scrap processors conduct business are highly competitive and became even more so due to the slow and uneven recovery from the global economic downturn and consolidations in the steel and scrap industries additionally in many applications steel competes with other materials such as aluminum cement composites plastics carbon fiber glass and wood increased use of alternative materials could decrease demand for steel and combined with increased competition could cause us to lose market share increase expenditures or reduce pricing any one of which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations or prospects the global steel industry suffers from overcapacity and that excess capacity intensifies price competition in some of our products a decrease in the global demand for steel scrap due to market or other conditions generally causes a decrease in the price of scrap metals a decrease in price could result in some scrap generators exiting the marketplace which could further decrease the availability of scrap this shortage in availability of scrap could have a material adverse effect on both our steelmaking and our metals recycling operations and thus on our business financial condition results of operations or prospects 

we are subject to significant risks relating to changes in commodity prices and may not be able to effectively protect against these risks 

we are exposed to commodity price risk during periods where we hold title to scrap metal products that we may hold in inventory for processing or resale prices of commodities including scrap can be volatile due to numerous factors beyond our control in an increasing price environment for raw materials competitive conditions may limit our ability to pass on price increases to our consumers in a decreasing price environment for processed scrap we may not have the ability to fully recoup the cost of raw materials that we procure process and sell to our customers in addition new entrants into the market areas we serve could result in higher purchase prices for raw materials and lower margins from our scrap we have not hedged positions in certain commodities such as ferrous scrap where futures markets are not well established thus our sales and inventory position will be vulnerable to adverse changes in commodity prices which could materially adversely impact our operating and financial performance 

the profitability of our metals recycling operations depends in part on the availability of an adequate source of supply 

we procure our scrap inventory from numerous sources these suppliers generally are not bound by longterm contracts and have no obligation to sell recyclable metal to us in periods of low industry prices suppliers may elect to hold recyclable metal to wait for higher prices or intentionally slow their metal collection activities if a substantial number of suppliers cease selling recyclable metal to us we will be unable to recycle metal at desired levels and our results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected in addition a slowdown of industrial production in the us reduces the supply of industrial grades of metal to the metal recycling industry resulting in our having less recyclable metal available to process and market 

we may face risks associated with the implementation of our growth strategy 

our growth strategy subjects us to various risks as part of our growth strategy we may expand existing facilities enter into new product or process initiatives acquire or build additional plants acquire other businesses and assets enter into joint ventures or form strategic alliances that we believe 

will complement our existing business these transactions will likely involve some or all of the following risks 

• the risk of entering markets in which we have little experience • the difficulty of competing for acquisitions and other growth opportunities with companies having materially greater financial resources than us • the inability to realize anticipated synergies or other benefits expected from an acquisition • the difficulty of integrating the new or acquired operations and personnel into our existing operations • the potential disruption of ongoing operations • the diversion of financial resources to new operations or acquired businesses • the diversion of management attention from other business concerns to new operations or acquired businesses • the loss of key employees and customers of acquired businesses • the potential exposure to unknown liabilities • the inability of management to maintain uniform standards controls procedures and policies • the difficulty of managing the growth of a larger company • the risk of becoming involved in labor commercial or regulatory disputes or litigation related to the new operations or acquired businesses • the risk of becoming more highly leveraged • the risk of contractual or operational liability to other venture participants or to third parties as a result of our participation • the inability to work efficiently with joint venture or strategic alliance partners and • the difficulties of terminating joint ventures or strategic alliances these initiatives or transactions might be required for us to remain competitive but we may not be able to complete any such transactions on favorable terms or obtain financing if necessary future transactions may not improve our competitive position and business prospects as anticipated and if they do not our sales and earnings may be significantly reduced 

impairment charges could adversely affect our results of operations 

we periodically test goodwill intangible assets and longlived assets to determine whether their estimated fair value is less than their value recorded on our balance sheet if we determine that the fair value of any of these assets is less than the value recorded on our balance sheet we will incur noncash impairment charges that could adversely affect our results of operations 

during the fourth quarter of 2014 we assessed the carrying value of the minnesota ironmaking operations fixed assets and determined that the future estimated cash flow did not support the value in place therefore we recorded a pretax noncash asset impairment charge of 260 million and based on our joint venture ownership percentage reduced consolidated company net income by 1326 million due to a significant and sustained decline in global pig iron pricing which resulted in the cost of iron nugget production being higher than product selling values we indefinitely idled our minnesota ironmaking operations in may 2015 

during the fourth quarter of 2015 as a part of our annual goodwill and indefinitelived intangible asset assessment it was determined that the fair market value of our metals recycling operations was less than its carrying value due to the sustained weak global scrap commodity outlook we determined that the carrying value of the metals recycling operations was impaired resulting in pretax noncash goodwill trade name and other related asset impairment charges of 4285 million 

we are subject to litigation and legal compliance risks which could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and liquidity 

we are involved along with two other remaining steel manufacturing company defendants in a class action antitrust suit in federal court in chicago illinois originally against eight companies the complaint alleges a conspiracy on the part of the original defendants to fix raise maintain and stabilize the price at which steel products were sold in the united states during a specified period between 2005 and 2007 by artificially restricting the supply of such steel products all but one of the complaints were brought on behalf of a purported class consisting of all direct purchasers of steel products the other complaint was brought on behalf of a purported class consisting of all indirect purchasers of steel products within the same time period in addition another similar complaint was filed in december 2010 purporting to be on behalf of indirect purchasers of steel products in tennessee all complaints have been consolidated in the chicago action and seek treble damages and costs including reasonable attorney fees pre and postjudgment interest and injunctive relief following an extensive period of discovery and related motions concerning class certification matters the court on september 9 2015 certified a class limited however to the issue of the alleged conspiracy alone and denied class certification on the issue of antitrust impact and damages as a result some additional discovery is ongoing we have also filed a motion for summary judgment as has codefendant ssab and this is currently pending 

due to the uncertain nature of litigation we cannot presently determine the ultimate outcome of this litigation based on the information available at this time we have determined that there is not presently a reasonable possibility as that term is defined in asc 4502020 that the outcome of these legal proceedings would have a material impact on our financial condition results of operations or liquidity although not presently necessary or appropriate to make a dollar estimate of exposure to loss if any in connection with the above matter we may in the future determine that a loss accrual is necessary although we may make loss accruals if and as warranted any amounts that we may accrue from time to time could vary significantly from the amounts we actually pay due to inherent uncertainties and the inherent shortcomings of the estimation process the uncertainties involved in litigation and other factors additionally an adverse result could have a material effect on our financial condition results of operations and liquidity 

we are involved in various routine litigation matters including administrative proceedings regulatory proceedings governmental investigations environmental matters and commercial and construction contract disputes 

in addition to risks associated with our environmental and other regulatory compliance our international operations are subject to complex foreign and us laws and regulations including the foreign corrupt practices act regulations related to importexport controls the office of foreign assets control and other laws and regulations each of which may increase our cost of doing business and expose us to increased risk 

unexpected equipment downtime or shutdowns could adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and prospects 

interruptions in our production capabilities could adversely affect our production costs products available for sale and earnings during the affected period in addition to equipment failures our 

facilities are also subject to the risk of catastrophic loss due to unanticipated events such as fires explosions or violent weather conditions our manufacturing processes are dependent upon critical pieces of steelmaking equipment such as our furnaces continuous casters and rolling equipment as well as electrical equipment such as transformers this equipment may on occasion be out of service as a result of unanticipated failures or other events we have experienced and may in the future experience plant shutdowns or periods of reduced production as a result of such equipment failures or other events these disruptions could have an adverse effect on our operations customer service levels financial results and prospects 

we have incurred and may incur in the future costs to idle facilities idled facility carrying costs or increased costs to resume production at idled facilities 

due to a significant and sustained decline in global pig iron pricing which resulted in the cost of iron nugget production being higher than product selling values we indefinitely idled our minnesota ironmaking operations in may 2015 we incurred approximately 348 million inclusive of noncontrolling interest of 51 million of expenses related to the idling including 210 million of noncash inventory valuation adjustments we currently incur minor ongoing carrying costs related to these idled facilities and should we in the future resume production we would incur further costs related to preparing the minnesota ironmaking operations for operation perform any required repairs and maintenance and training employees 

should economic or market conditions dictate we may in the future idle additional facilities which may require us to incur additional idling and carrying costs related to those facilities as well as further increased costs should production be resumed at any idled facility which could have an adverse effect on our financial results and results of operations 

we may face risks to the security of our information technology 

increased global information technology security requirements vulnerabilities threats and a rise in sophisticated and targeted cybercrime pose a risk to the security of our systems our information networks and to the confidentiality availability and integrity of our data as well as to the functionality of our automated and electronically controlled manufacturing operating systems although we have adopted procedures and controls to protect our information and operating technology including sensitive proprietary information and confidential and personal data there can be no assurance that a system or network failure or security breach will be prevented this could lead to system interruption production delays or downtimes and operational disruptions the disclosure modification or destruction of proprietary and other key information which could have an adverse effect on our reputation financial results and results of operations 

governmental agencies may refuse to grant or renew some of our licenses and permits 

we must receive licenses air water and other permits and approvals from state and local governments to conduct certain of our operations or to develop or acquire new facilities governmental agencies sometimes resist the establishment of certain types of facilities in their communities including scrap metal collection and processing facilities there can be no assurance that future approvals licenses and permits will be granted or that we will be able to maintain and renew the approvals licenses and permits we currently hold failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition

 item 3 legal proceedings 

we are involved along with two other remaining steel manufacturing company defendants in a class action antitrust suit in federal court in chicago illinois originally against eight companies the complaint alleges a conspiracy on the part of the original defendants to fix raise maintain and stabilize the price at which steel products were sold in the united states during a specified period between 2005 and 2007 by artificially restricting the supply of such steel products all but one of the complaints were brought on behalf of a purported class consisting of all direct purchasers of steel products the other complaint was brought on behalf of a purported class consisting of all indirect purchasers of steel products within the same time period in addition another similar complaint was filed in december 2010 purporting to be on behalf of indirect purchasers of steel products in tennessee all complaints have been consolidated in the chicago action and seek treble damages and costs including reasonable attorney fees pre and postjudgment interest and injunctive relief following an extensive period of discovery and related motions concerning class certification matters the court on september 9 2015 certified a class limited however to the issue of the alleged conspiracy alone and denied class certification on the issue of antitrust impact and damages as a result some additional discovery is ongoing we have also filed a motion for summary judgment as has codefendant ssab and this matter is currently pending 

due however to the uncertain nature of litigation we cannot presently determine the ultimate outcome of this litigation based on the information available at this time we have determined that there is not presently a reasonable possibility as that term is defined in asc 4502020 that the outcome of these legal proceedings would have a material impact on our financial condition results of operations or liquidity although not presently necessary or appropriate to make a dollar estimate of exposure to loss if any in connection with the above matter we may in the future determine that a loss accrual is necessary although we may make loss accruals if and as warranted any amounts that we may accrue from time to time could vary significantly from the amounts we actually pay due to inherent uncertainties and the inherent shortcomings of the estimation process the uncertainties involved in litigation and other factors additionally an adverse result could have a material effect on our financial condition results of operations and liquidity 

we are also involved in various routine litigation matters including administrative proceedings regulatory proceedings governmental investigations environmental matters and commercial and construction contract disputes none of which are expected to have a material impact on our financial condition results of operations or liquidity

2015 overview 

we are one of the largest steel producers and one of the largest metals recyclers in the united states based on a current estimated annual steelmaking and coating capability of approximately 11 million tons and actual recycling volumes the primary sources of our revenues and operating income are from the manufacture and sale of steel products processing and sale of recycled ferrous and nonferrous metals and the fabrication and sale of steel joist and deck products in the third quarter 2015 we changed our reportable segments consistent with how we currently manage the business representing three reporting segments steel operations metals recycling operations and steel fabrication operations 

metals recycling operations segment asset impairment charges 

in the fourth quarter of 2015 we recorded pretax noncash impairment charges related to goodwill indefinitelived intangibles and certain other assets associated with omnisource the companys metal recycling operations which reduced 2015 operating income by 4285 million and net income and net income attributable to steel dynamics inc by 2687 million and basic and diluted earnings per share by 111 during the companys 2015 annual goodwill and indefinitelived intangible asset impairment analysis we determined that the fair value of omnisource was less than its carrying value and upon the completion of the second step of the impairment analysis that the goodwill and trade name indefinitelived intangible assets were impaired the omnisource goodwill and trade name assets were written down to their respective fair values resulting in noncash asset impairment charges of 3413 million and 685 million respectively upon the december 31 2015 determination and classification of certain omnisource property and plant assets as held for sale the company recorded a 103 million noncash asset impairment the company reflected a total of 4285 million of pretax noncash asset impairment charges in the consolidated statement of operations for the year ended december 31 2015 within the metals recycling operations 

our 2015 consolidated operational and financial results were negatively impacted by decreased steel shipments excluding columbus flat roll division for the 2015 and 2014 periods and average steel product pricing driven by continuing excessive and historically high levels of steel imports while scrap costs also decreased significantly throughout 2015 steel metal margins contracted as the drop in steel selling prices was more severe than the decline of scrap costs underlying domestic steel consumption remained steady as we continue to see improvements in nonresidential construction as well as steady consumption in automotive and other manufacturing segments however a larger portion 

of the domestic steel demand was served by imports in 2015 than compared to 2014 as a result of this as well as customer destocking domestic steel mill utilization rates decreased throughout 2015 as compared to 2014 resulting in decreased ferrous scrap shipments in our metals recycling operations decreased shipments along with metal margin compression due to monthly price declines resulted in significantly reduced profitability in our metals recycling operations in 2015 as compared to 2014 during 2015 our steel fabrication operations continued to benefit from the sustained improvements in nonresidential construction demand our market share and expanding geographic footprint and lower steel raw material costs resulting in significant increases in both sales and operating income compared to 2014 

excluding the impact of the 4285 million and 2600 million in pretax noncash impairment charges in 2015 and 2014 respectively consolidated operating income decreased 2246 million or 39 to 3557 million in 2015 compared to 5803 million in 2014 and net income decreased 1513 million or 52 to 1383 million or 057 per diluted share during 2015 compared with net income of 2896 million or 122 per diluted share during 2014 the impact of the 4285 million pretax noncash impairment charge related to our metals recycling operations reduced 2015 net income by 2687 million and our diluted earnings per share by 111 the impact of the 2600 million pretax noncash impairment charge related to our minnesota ironmaking operations including amounts attributable to noncontrolling interests of 465 million reduced 2014 net income attributable to steel dynamics inc by 1326 million and our diluted earnings per share by 055 

2014 overview 

acquisition of severstal columbus llc columbus flat roll division 

on september 16 2014 we completed our acquisition of columbus flat roll division on a debtfree basis for a purchase price of 1625 billion with additional working capital adjustments of 444 million the columbus flat roll division acquisition was funded through the issuance of 12 billion of senior notes borrowings under our senior secured credit facility and available cash we purchased columbus flat roll division to significantly expand and diversify our steel operating base with the addition of 34 million tons of hot roll steel production capacity the product offerings are diversified with respect to width gauge and strength when compared to the capabilities of our butler flat roll division located in northeast mississippi columbus flat roll division is one of the newest and most technologically advanced sheet steel electric arc furnace mills in north america with access to nonenergy related pipe and tube oil country tubular goods octg and automotive markets additionally columbus flat roll division is advantageously located to serve the growing markets in the southern us and mexico providing geographic diversification and growth opportunities columbus flat roll division operating results have been reflected in our financial statements since the effective date of the acquisition in the steel operations columbus flat roll division reported revenues of 6383 million and pretax income of 561 million during the september 16 to december 31 2014 period before giving effect to 264 million of purchase accounting related cost of goods sold expenses associated with the stepup in inventory fixed assets and intangible assets and 252 million of acquisition and related costs that are included in other expenses in the consolidated statement of operations for the year ended december 31 2014 

minnesota ironmaking operations impairment 

during the fourth quarter of 2014 our minnesota ironmaking operations reached a steady operating state indicating a consistency in the operations production capability processes and cost structure including the ability to utilize certain lowercost raw materials given this we undertook an assessment of the recoverability of the carrying value of our minnesota ironmaking operations fixed assets given our outlook at that time regarding future operating costs and product pricing 

we concluded that the carrying value of these fixed assets was no longer fully recoverable and the fixed assets were in fact impaired this assessment resulted in a 2600 million pretax noncash impairment charge including amounts attributable to noncontrolling interests of 465 million which reduced net income attributable to steel dynamics inc by 1326 million the impact of losses from our minnesota ironmaking operations on 2014 net income including the impact of the 2600 million of pretax noncash impairment charges was approximately 1659 million excluding the 2600 million in pretax noncash asset impairment charges the impact of minnesota ironmaking operations on 2014 net income attributable to steel dynamics inc was approximately 333 million as compared to approximately 419 million in 2013 

net sales in 2014 of 88 billion increased 19 from 2013 net sales of 74 billion due to increased shipments in all of our operating segments and higher average selling prices in our steel and steel fabrication operations we achieved record volumes in our steel and steel fabrication operations which reported increased shipments of 19 4 without columbus flat roll division and 31 respectively in 2014 as compared to 2013 demand continued to be strong in the automotive and manufacturing markets the nonresidential construction markets continued to improve and we began to realize sales from our new specialbarquality smallerdiameter rolling mill at our engineered bar products division and from our premium rail expansion at our structural and rail division our metal spreads in steel and steel fabrication operations also improved as market pricing increased to a greater degree than raw materials costs plant utilization was also strong which resulted in volumerelated cost compression in our steel and steel fabrication operations while shipments increased at our metals recycling operations operating income decreased in 2014 when compared to 2013 due to decreases in metal spreads the impact of losses from our minnesota ironmaking operations on 2014 net income reflected in other including the impact of the 2600 million of pretax noncash asset impairment charges was approximately 1659 million or 069 per diluted share as compared to approximately 42 million or 018 per diluted share in 2013 as a result of the above net income in 2014 including the impact of impairment charges decreased 323 million or 17 to 1570 million or 067 per diluted share 

excluding the impact of the 2600 million in pretax noncash asset impairment charges consolidated operating income increased 1938 million or 50 to 5803 million in 2014 compared to 3865 million in 2013 and net income increased 1003 million or 53 to 2896 million or 122 per diluted share during 2014 compared with net income of 1893 million or 083 per diluted share during 2013 the impact of the 2600 million pretax noncash asset impairment charge related to our minnesota ironmaking operations including amounts attributable to noncontrolling interests of 465 million reduced net income attributable to steel dynamics inc by 1326 million and our diluted earnings per share by 055

steel operations shipments and average selling price 

segment results 2015 vs 2014 

overall steel operations performance in 2015 compared to 2014 was negatively impacted by continuing excessive and historically high levels of steel imports customers destocking inventories and sharply falling steel and scrap prices domestic steel consumption was relatively steady during 2015 with strong automotive and improving nonresidential steel markets but a large portion of the domestic consumption was served by imports net sales for the steel operations decreased 7 in 2015 when compared to 2014 as a 14 increase in steel operations shipments was more than offset by a decrease of 149 per ton or 18 in average selling prices in spite of solid overall domestic steel demand average selling prices decreased throughout 2015 due to elevated levels of imported steel into the united states and significant reductions in the cost of scrap which also caused uncertainty for steel consumers steel operations shipments increased 14 in 2015 compared to 2014 with the inclusion of columbus flat roll division for the full year of 2015 acquired september 16 2014 as 2015 sales volumes excluding them were down 12 compared to 2014 

metallic raw materials used in our electric arc furnaces represent our single most significant steel manufacturing cost during 2015 and 2014 our metallic raw material costs represented 55 and 65 respectively of our steel operations manufacturing costs excluding the operations of the techs which purchases rather than produces the steel it further processes our metallic raw material cost per net ton consumed in our steel operations decreased 105 or 29 in 2015 compared with 2014 consistent with overall declines in scrap market pricing 

decreases in steel selling prices more than offset decreases in raw material cost per ton resulting in 2015 metal spread which we define as the difference between average selling prices and the cost of ferrous scrap consumed contracting significantly compared to 2014 thus despite increased shipments from the inclusion of columbus flat roll division for the full year 2015 versus only four and a half months in 2014 operating income for the steel operations decreased 41 to 4032 million compared to 2014 

segment results 2014 vs 2013

interest expense net of capitalized interest during 2015 interest expense increased 177 million or 12 to 1540 million when compared to 2014 the increase in interest expense is due primarily to the addition of the 12 billion senior notes in september 2014 in conjunction with our acquisition of columbus flat roll division partially offset by the conversion or payoff at maturity of 2875 million of 5125 convertible notes in june 2014 and the call of our 3500 million 7 5  8  senior notes due 2020 in march 2015 

other expense net during 2015 net other expense of 154 million included 167 million of call premium and other financing costs associated with the march 2015 senior notes call and prepayment net other expense of 183 million in 2014 included 252 million of acquisition and financing costs associated with our september 2014 columbus flat roll division acquisition 

income tax expense benefit during 2015 our income tax benefit was 969 million at an effective income tax rate of 400 as compared to expense of 732 million resulting in an effective income tax rate of 444 during 2014 the higher effective tax rate in 2014 was due primarily to the impact of the increased noncontrolling interest losses offset somewhat by increased benefits from other permanent tax benefit items most notably the domestic manufacturing deduction 

included in the balance of unrecognized tax benefits at december 31 2015 of 160 million are potential benefits of 117 million that if recognized would affect the effective tax rate we recognize interest and penalties related to our tax contingencies on a netoftax basis in income tax expense benefit during the year ended december 31 2015 we recognized benefits from the reduction of interest expense of 100000 net of tax in addition to the unrecognized tax benefits noted above we had 52 million accrued for the payment of interest and penalties at december 31 2015 

we file income tax returns in the us federal jurisdiction as well as income tax returns in various state jurisdictions the irs is currently examining our federal income tax returns for the years 2010 and 2011 at this time we do not believe there will be any significant examination adjustments that would result in a material change to our financial position results of operations or cash flows it is 

reasonably possible that the amount of unrecognized tax benefits could change in the next twelve months as a result of these federal income tax audits and state income tax audits based on the current audits in process the payment of taxes as a result of audit settlements could be in an amount from zero to 71 million by the end of 2016 with the exception of the 2010 federal return which is currently under examination we are no longer subject to federal state and local income tax examinations by tax authorities for years ended before 2011 

consolidated results 2014 vs 2013 

selling general and administrative expense selling general and administrative expenses including profit sharing and amortization of intangible assets were 3859 million during 2014 as compared to 3323 million during 2013 an increase of 536 million or 16 during 2014 and 2013 these selling general and administrative expenses represented approximately 44 and 45 of net sales respectively the increase in total sga expenses in 2014 compared to 2013 relates most notably to the increased profit sharing incentive compensation and stock compensation expenses of 355 million which increased due to increased profitability before the minnesota ironmaking operations asset impairment charges while total intangible assets increased slightly due to the acquisition of columbus flat roll division amortization of intangible assets decreased 42 million or 13 during 2014 compared to 2013 due to the accelerated amortization methods used for intangible assets related to existing customer and scrap generator relationships 

interest expense net of capitalized interest during 2014 gross interest expense increased 74 million or 6 to 1397 million and capitalized interest decreased 21 million to 25 million as compared to 2013 the decrease in interest capitalized during these periods relates to growth or expansion projects initiated in 2013 at two of our steel mills that were completed in 2014 the increase in gross interest expense is due primarily to the addition of the 12 billion senior notes in september 2014 in conjunction with our acquisition of columbus flat roll division partially offset by the conversion or payoff at maturity of 2875 million of 5125 convertible notes in june 2014 

other income expense net other expense increased 223 million to 183 million during 2014 as compared to other income of 40 million during 2013 due primarily to 252 million in acquisition and finance costs associated with the acquisition of columbus flat roll division 

income tax expense benefit during 2014 our income tax expense was 732 million as compared to 993 million during 2013 and our effective income tax rate before exclusion of noncontrolling interests was 444 and 378 for 2014 and 2013 respectively the higher effective income tax rate in 2014 is due primarily to the impact of the increased noncontrolling interest losses offset somewhat by increased benefits from other permanent tax benefit items most notably the domestic manufacturing deduction the 2013 effective tax rate benefited from the effects of additional stock option exercises during 2013 and 2012 research and development tax credits enacted in january 2013 

liquidity and capital resources 

columbus flat roll division acquisition in september 2014 we issued 7000 million of 5125 senior notes due 2021 and 5000 million of 5500 senior notes due 2024 together the senior notes the proceeds from the issuance of the senior notes along with cash on hand and 1178 million in borrowings under our senior secured credit facility were used to fund the september 16 2014 acquisition of columbus flat roll division and related expenses 

capital resources and longterm debt our business is capital intensive and requires substantial expenditures for among other things the purchase and maintenance of equipment used in our steelmaking and finishing operations and to remain in compliance with environmental laws our 

shortterm and longterm liquidity needs arise primarily from working capital requirements capital expenditures principal and interest payments related to our outstanding indebtedness dividends to our shareholders and acquisitions we have met these liquidity requirements primarily with cash provided by operations longterm borrowings and availability under our revolver we had record liquidity at december 31 2015 is as follows in thousands 



our total outstanding debt decreased 3872 million during 2015 to 26 billion due primarily to our march 2015 call and prepayment of 3500 million in 7 5  8  senior notes due 2020 as a result our total longterm debt to capitalization ratio representing our longterm debt including current maturities divided by the sum of our longterm debt redeemable noncontrolling interests and our total stockholders equity decreased to 496 at december 31 2015 from 516 at december 31 2014 

we have a senior secured credit facility facility that matures in november 2019 which provides for a 12 billion revolver along with a term loan facility subject to certain conditions we also have the ability to increase the combined facility size by a minimum of 750 million the facility contains financial and other covenants pertaining to our ability which may under certain circumstances be limited to make capital expenditures incur indebtedness permit liens on property enter into transactions with affiliates make restricted payments or investments enter into mergers acquisitions or consolidations conduct asset sales pay dividends or distributions and enter into other specified transactions and activities our ability to borrow funds within the terms of the revolver is dependent upon our continued compliance with the financial and other covenants at december 31 2015 we had 12 billion of availability on the revolver 128 million of outstanding letters of credit and other obligations which reduce availability and there were no borrowings outstanding 

the financial covenants under our facility state that we must maintain an interest coverage ratio of not less than 250100 our interest coverage ratio is calculated by dividing our lasttwelve trailing months ltm consolidated adjusted ebitda earnings before interest taxes depreciation amortization and certain other noncash transactions as allowed in our facility by our ltm gross interest expense less amortization of financing fees in addition a net debt as defined in the facility to consolidated ltm adjusted ebitda net debt leverage ratio of not more than 500100 must be maintained if the net debt leverage ratio exceeds 350100 at any time our ability to make certain payments as defined in the facility which includes cash dividends to stockholders and share purchases among other things is limited at december 31 2015 our interest coverage ratio and net debt leverage ratio were 476100 and 299100 respectively we were therefore in compliance with these covenants at december 31 2015 and we anticipate we will continue to be in compliance during the next twelve months 

working capital we generated cash flow from operations of over 10 billion in 2015 operational working capital representing amounts invested in trade receivables and inventories less current liabilities other than income taxes payable and debt decreased 4768 million during 2015 to 12 billion amounts invested in accounts receivable and inventories net of accounts payable decreased 5305 million in conjunction with a decrease in sales and production volume and a significant decrease in the cost of scrap and steel when compared to the fourth quarter of 2014 

capital investments during 2015 we invested 1145 million in property plant and equipment consistent with the 1118 million during 2014 our current estimated 2016 cash allocation plan includes the investment of between 250 million and 300 million in capital expenditures in our existing and announced operations 

cash dividends as a reflection of confidence in our current and future cash flow generation ability and financial position we increased our quarterly cash dividend by 20 to 01375 per share in 2015 from 0115 per share in 2014 resulting in declared cash dividends of 1332 million during 2015 compared to 1086 million during 2014 we paid cash dividends of 1276 million and 1054 million during 2015 and 2014 respectively our board of directors along with executive management approves the payment of dividends on a quarterly basis the determination to pay cash dividends in the future is at the discretion of our board of directors after taking into account various factors including our financial condition results of operations outstanding indebtedness current and anticipated cash needs and growth plans in addition the terms of our senior secured credit facility and the indenture relating to our senior notes may restrict the amount of cash dividends we can pay 

other our ability to meet our debt service obligations and reduce our total debt will depend upon our future performance which in turn will depend upon general economic financial and business conditions along with competition legislation and regulatory factors that are largely beyond our control in addition we cannot assure that our operating results cash flows access to credit markets and capital resources will be sufficient for repayment of our indebtedness in the future we believe that based upon current levels of operations and anticipated growth cash flows from operations together with other available sources of funds including additional borrowings under our revolver through its term which expires in november 2019 will be adequate for the next twelve months for making required payments of principal and interest on our indebtedness funding working capital requirements and anticipated capital expenditures 

during 2015 we received benefits from state and local governments in the form of real estate and personal property tax abatements and credits of approximately 236 million based on our current abatements and incentive credits and utilizing our existing longlived asset structure we estimate the remaining annual benefit to our future operations to be approximately 236 million 236 million 119 million 25 million 14 million 13 million and 12 million during the years 2016 through 2022 respectively 

contractual obligations and other longterm liabilities 

we have the following minimum commitments under contractual obligations including purchase obligations as defined by the securities and exchange commission a purchase obligation is defined as an agreement to purchase goods or services that is enforceable and legally binding and that specifies all significant terms including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased fixed minimum or variable price provisions and the approximate timing of the transaction other longterm liabilities are defined as longterm liabilities that are reflected on our balance sheet under generally accepted accounting principles based on this definition the following table includes only those contracts which include fixed or minimum obligations it does not include normal purchases which are made in the ordinary course of business the following table provides aggregated information about outstanding contractual obligations and other longterm liabilities as of december 31 2015 in thousands 



1 the longterm debt payment information presented above assumes that our term loan and senior notes remain outstanding until maturity refer to note 3 to the consolidated financial statements elsewhere in this report for additional information regarding these transactions and our longterm debt 2 the estimated interest payments shown above assume interest rates of 190 variable rate at december 31 2015 on the 2375 million term loan issued november 2014 maturing in november 2019 6 1  8  on our 4000 million senior unsecured notes due august 2019 5125 on our 7000 million senior unsecured notes due october 2021 6 3  8  on our 3500 million senior unsecured notes due august 2022 5 1  4  on our 4000 million senior unsecured notes due march 2023 5500 on our 5000 million senior unsecured notes due october 2024 0275 commitment fee on our available senior secured revolver and an average of 55 on our other debt of 406 million 3 purchase obligations include commitments we have for the purchase of electricity natural gas and its transportation fuel air products and zinc these arrangements have take or pay or other similar commitment provisions we have utilized such take or pay requirements during the past three years under these contracts except for certain air products at our minnesota ironmaking operations which were idled in may 2015 4 construction commitments relate to firm contracts we have with various vendors for the completion of certain construction projects at our various divisions at december 31 2015 5 other commitments principally relate to certain pension and deferred compensation plan obligations 6 we expect to make cash outlays in the future related to our unrecognized tax benefits however due to the uncertainty of the timing we are unable to make reasonably reliable estimates regarding the period of cash settlement with the respective taxing authorities accordingly unrecognized tax benefits and related interest and penalties of 212 million as of december 31 2015 have been excluded from the contractual obligations table above refer to note 4 to the consolidated financial statements elsewhere in this report for additional information 

other matters 

inflation 

we believe that inflation has not had a material effect on our results of operations 

environmental and other contingencies 

we have incurred and in the future will continue to incur capital expenditures and operating expenses for matters relating to environmental control remediation monitoring and compliance during 2015 we incurred costs related to the monitoring and compliance of environmental matters in the amount of approximately 357 million and capital expenditures related to environmental compliance of approximately 62 million of the costs incurred during 2015 for monitoring and compliance 78 were related to the normal transportation of certain types of waste produced in our steelmaking processes and other facilities in accordance with legal requirements we incurred combined environmental remediation costs of approximately 850000 at all of our facilities during 2015 we have an accrual of 22 million recorded for environmental remediation related to our metals recycling operations and 27 million related to minnesota ironmaking operations we believe apart from our dependence on environmental construction and operating permits for our existing and any future manufacturing facilities that compliance with current environmental laws and regulations is not likely to have a materially adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or liquidity however environmental laws and regulations evolve and change and we may become subject to more stringent environmental laws and regulations in the future such as the impact of us government or various governmental agencies introducing regulatory changes in response to the potential of climate change 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

managements discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the u s we review the accounting policies we use in reporting our financial results on a regular basis the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent liabilities we evaluate the appropriateness of these estimations and judgments on an ongoing basis we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources results may differ from these estimates due to actual outcomes being different from those on which we based our assumptions we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 

revenue recognition and allowance for doubtful accounts except for our steel fabrication operations we recognize revenues from sales and the allowance for estimated returns from these sales when the title of the product transfers provision is made for estimated product returns and customer claims based on historical experience if the historical data used in our estimates does not reflect future returns and claims trends additional provision may be necessary the allowance for doubtful accounts is based on the companys best estimate of probably credit losses along with historical experience which estimates may or may not prove accurate our steel fabrication operations recognizes revenues from construction contracts using a percentage of completion methodology based on steel tons used on completed units todate as a percentage of estimated total steel tons required by each contract 

we are exposed to credit risk in the event of nonpayment by our customers which in steel operations are principally intermediate steel processors and service centers that sell our products to 

numerous industry sectors including the automotive construction manufacturing transportation heavy and agriculture equipment and pipe and tube including octg markets our metals recycling operations sell ferrous scrap to steel mills and foundries and nonferrous scrap such as copper brass aluminum and stainless steel to among others ingot manufacturers copper refineries and mills smelters and specialty mills our steel fabrication operations sell fabricated steel joists and deck primarily to the nonresidential construction market we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments based on known credit risks historical loss experience and current economic conditions affecting our customers we mitigate our exposure to credit risk by performing ongoing credit evaluations and taking further action when necessary such as requiring letters of credit or other security interests to support the receivable from our customer if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate resulting in the impairment of their ability to make payments additional allowance may be required 

inventories we record inventories at lower of cost or market cost is determined using a weighted average cost method for scrap and on a firstin firstout basis for other inventory we record amounts required if any to reduce the carrying value of inventory to its net realizable value as a charge to cost of goods sold if product selling prices were to decline in future periods further writedown of inventory could result specifically raw material inventory such as scrap purchased during periods of peak market pricing upon deciding to idle the minnesota ironmaking operations and to monetize existing raw material inventory we recorded an inventory lowerofcost or market charge of 210 million inclusive of noncontrolling interests of 36 million in cost of goods sold in the second quarter 2015 

impairments of longlived tangible and definitelived intangible assets we review longlived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of such assets may not be fully recoverable impairment losses are recorded on longlived assets used in operations when indicators of impairment are present and the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than the assets carrying amounts the impairment loss is measured by comparing the fair value of the asset to its carrying amount we consider various factors and determine whether an impairment test is necessary including by way of examples a significant and prolonged deterioration in operating results andor projected cash flows significant changes in the extent or manner in which an asset is used technological advances with respect to assets which would potentially render them obsolete our strategy and capital planning and the economic climate in markets to be served when determining future cash flows and if necessary fair value we must make judgments as to the expected utilization of assets and estimated future cash flows related to those assets we consider historical and anticipated future results general economic and market conditions the impact of planned business and operational strategies and all other available information at the time the estimates are made those estimates and judgments may or may not ultimately prove accurate 

a longlived asset is classified as held for sale upon meeting specified criteria related to ability and intent to sell an asset classified as held for sale is measured at the lower of its carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell as of december 31 2015 the company reported 86 million of land and buildings as assets held for sale within other current assets in our consolidated balance sheet an impairment loss is recognized for any initial or subsequent writedown of the asset held for sale to its fair value less cost to sell upon the december 31 2015 determination and classification of these assets as held for sale the company recorded a 103 million asset impairment charge in the consolidated statement of operations for the year ended december 31 2015 the company determined fair value using level 3 inputs as provided for under asc 820 consisting of information provided by brokers and other external sources along with managements own assumptions 

during the fourth quarter of 2014 our minnesota ironmaking operations reached a steady state indicating a consistency in the operations production capability processes and cost structure including the ability to utilize certain lowercost raw materials given this we undertook an assessment of the 

recoverability of the carrying value of our minnesota ironmaking operations fixed assets with our outlook at that time regarding future operating costs and product pricing we concluded that the carrying value of these fixed assets was no longer fully recoverable and the fixed assets were in fact impaired this assessment resulted in a 2600 million pretax noncash impairment charge including amounts attributable to noncontrolling interests of 465 million which is reflected in other in note 13 segment information the carrying values of the impaired assets were adjusted to their expected fair values as determined primarily on the cost approach as well as expected future discounted cash flows income approach using level 3 inputs under asc 820 

goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets 

our goodwill relates to various business combinations and is allocated to the following reporting units at december 31in thousands 



at least once annually or when indicators of impairment exist we perform an impairment test for goodwill goodwill is allocated to various reporting units which are generally one level below our operating segments we utilize a twostepped approach to measuring goodwill impairment the first step of the test determines if there is potential goodwill impairment in this step we compare the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying amount which includes goodwill the fair value of the reporting unit is determined by using an estimate of future cash flows utilizing a riskadjusted discount rate to calculate the net present value of future cash flows income approach and by using a market approach based upon an analysis of valuation metrics of comparable peer companies if the carrying amount exceeds the fair value we perform the second step of the test which measures the amount of impairment loss to be recorded in the second step we compare the carrying amount of the goodwill to the implied fair value of the goodwill based on the net fair value of the recognized and unrecognized assets and liabilities of the reporting unit if the implied fair value is less than the carrying value an impairment loss is recorded to the extent that the fair value of the goodwill is less than its carrying value 

key assumptions used to determine the estimated fair value of each reporting unit under the discounted cash flows method income approach include a expected cash flows for the fiveyear period following the testing date including market share sales volumes and prices costs to produce and estimated capital needs b an estimated terminal value using a terminal year growth rate determined based on the growth prospects of the reporting unit and c a riskadjusted discount rate based on managements best estimate of market participants aftertax weighted average cost of capital and market risk premiums key assumptions used to determine the estimated fair value of each reporting unit under the market approach include the expected revenues and cash flows in the next year we consider historical and anticipated future results general economic and market conditions the impact of planned business and operational strategies and all available information at the time the fair 

values of its reporting units are estimated those estimates and judgments may or may not ultimately prove accurate 

goodwill and other intangible assets acquired in past transactions are naturally more susceptible to impairment primarily due to the fact that they are recorded at fair value based on operating plans and economic conditions at the time of acquisition consequently if operating results andor economic conditions deteriorate after an acquisition it could result in the impairment of the acquired assets a deterioration of economic conditions may not only negatively impact the estimated operating cash flows used in our cash flow models but may also negatively impact other assumptions used in our analyses including but not limited to the estimated cost of capital andor discount rates additionally we are required to ensure that assumptions used to determine fair value in our analyses are consistent with the assumptions a hypothetical marketplace participant would use as a result the cost of capital andor discount rates used in our analyses may increase or decrease based on market conditions and trends regardless of whether our actual cost of capital has changed therefore we may recognize an impairment of an intangible asset or assets in spite of realizing actual cash flows that are approximately equal to or greater than our previously forecasted amounts 

our other indefinitelived intangible assets relate to trade names acquired through various business combinations and is allocated to the following reporting units at december 31 in thousands 



at least annually or when indicators of impairment exist we test for indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment through the comparison of the fair value of the specific intangible asset with its carrying amount the fair value of the intangible asset is determined by using an estimate of future cash flows attributable to the asset and a riskadjusted discount rate to compute a net present value of future cash flows if the fair value is less than the carrying value an impairment loss is recorded in an amount equal to the excess in carrying value 

during the fourth quarter of 2015 we determined that the fair value of omnisource was less than its carrying value and upon the completion of the impairment analysis that the goodwill and trade name assets were impaired the decrease in omnisource fair value from our prior year impairment analysis was the result of a forecasted reduction in future cash flows based on managements view of the weaker longerterm global scrap commodity outlook this outlook became clearer in the fourth quarter of 2015 from the longevity of 1 the prolonged strength of the us dollar decreasing scrap export volume resulting in excess domestic supply 2 currency devaluation contributing to china and russia supplying alternative scrap materials to turkey versus those coming from the us and 3 slower global growth decreasing demand for scrap while the scrap commodity outlook deteriorated throughout much of 2015 there were indicators of improvement during the year such as the restoration of the ratio of iron ore to scrap costs to a more historically consistent relationship as well as a midyear scrap pricing increase versus the monthly decreases experienced throughout much of the year including large decreases in both the first and fourth quarters upon the fourth quarter decrease in selling prices and resulting metal spreads we concluded that the impact of the factors noted above were longerterm which resulted in our reassessment of our future longterm cash flows the omnisource goodwill and trade name indefinitelived intangible assets were written down to their respective fair values resulting in pretax noncash asset impairment charges of 3413 million and 685 million respectively that are reflected in asset impairment charges in the consolidated statement of operations for the year ended december 31 2015 within the metals recycling operations 

the 2015 annual goodwill and indefinitelived intangible asset impairment analysis did not result in any impairment charges related to any other of our reporting units management does not believe that it is reasonably likely that any of our reporting units will fail step one of a goodwill or indefinitelived asset impairment test in the near term we will continue to monitor operating results within all reporting units throughout the upcoming year in order to determine if events and circumstances warrant interim impairment testing otherwise all reporting units will again be subject to the required annual impairment test during the fourth quarter of 2016 due to the inherent uncertainties involved in forecasting changes in judgments and estimates underlying our analysis of goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets for possible impairment including expected future operating cash flows and discount rate could decrease the estimated fair value of our reporting units in the future resulting in further impairments 

income taxes we are required to estimate our income taxes as a part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements this requires us to estimate our actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatments of items for tax and accounting purposes these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities which are included within our consolidated balance sheet we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely we must establish a valuation allowance we establish reserves to reduce some or all of the tax benefit of any of our tax positions at the time we determine that the positions become uncertain we adjust these reserves including any impact on the related interest and penalties in light of changing facts and circumstances such as the progress of a tax audit a number of years may elapse before a particular matter for which we have established a reserve is audited by a taxing authority and finally resolved the number of years with open tax audits varies depending on the tax jurisdiction the tax benefit that has been previously reserved because of a failure to meet the more likely than not recognition threshold would be recognized in our income tax expense in the first interim period when the uncertainty disappears settlement of any particular issue would usually require the use of cash 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

market risk 

in the normal course of business we are exposed to interest rate changes our objectives in managing exposure to interest rate changes are to limit the impact of these rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower overall borrowing costs to achieve these objectives we primarily use interest rate swaps to manage net exposure to interest rate changes related to our portfolio of borrowings 

the following table represents the principal cash repayments and related weightedaverage interest rates by maturity date for our longterm debt as of december 31 2015 in thousands 



commodity risk 

in the normal course of business we are exposed to the market risk and price fluctuations related to the sale of our products and to the purchase of raw materials used in our operations such as metallic raw materials electricity natural gas and its transportation services fuel air products and zinc our risk strategy associated with product sales has generally been to obtain competitive prices for our products and to allow operating results to reflect market price movements dictated by supply and demand 

our risk strategy associated with the purchase of raw materials utilized within our operations has generally been to make some commitments with suppliers relating to future expected requirements for some commodities such as electricity natural gas and its transportation services fuel air products and zinc certain of these commitments contain provisions which require us to take or pay for specified quantities without regard to actual usage for periods of up to 24 months for physical commodity requirements for up to 4 years for commodity transportation requirements and for up to 13 years for air products our commitments for these arrangements with take or pay or other similar commitment provisions for the years ending december 31 are as follows in thousands 



we utilized such take or pay requirements during the past three years under these contracts except for certain air products at our minnesota ironmaking operations which were idled in may 2015 we believe that production requirements will be such that consumption of the products or services purchased under these commitments will occur in the normal production process other than certain air products related to our minnesota ironmaking operations during the idle period we also purchase electricity consumed at our flat roll division pursuant to a contract which extends through december 2017 the contract designates 160 hours annually as interruptible service and establishes an agreed fixedrate energy charge per millkwh consumed for each year through the expiration of the agreement 

in our metals recycling operations we have certain fixed price contracts with various customers and suppliers for future delivery of nonferrous metals our risk strategy has been to enter into base metal financial contracts with the goal to protect the profit margin within certain parameters that was contemplated when we entered into the transaction with the customer or vendor at december 31 2015 we had a cumulative unrealized loss associated with these financial contracts of 22 million substantially all of which have a settlement date in 2016 we believe the customer contracts associated with the financial contracts will be fully consummated

competitive strengths  business strategies 

we believe our financial strategy coupled with our competitive advantages of maintaining a low highly variable cost structure producing a diversified valueadded product offering controlling a secure supply of recycled ferrous metals fostering an entitywide entrepreneurial culture and having an experienced senior management team and work force positions us well to continue to strengthen our leadership position 

one of the lowest cost steel producers in the united states stateoftheart facilities  continue to maintain low production costs 

we are focused on continuing to maintain and enhance one of the lowest operating cost structures in the north american steel industry our low operating costs are primarily a result of our efficient plant designs and operations our high productivity rate such as our productivity rate of approximately 3 man hours per hot band ton produced at our butler flat roll division low ongoing maintenance cost requirements and strategic locations near our customers and sources of our primary raw material ferrous scrap 

we will continue to strive to optimize the use of our equipment enhance our productivity and explore new technologies to further improve our unit costs of production at each of our facilities we believe that as one of the lowest cost producers in each of our primary operating segments we are able to better manage through cyclical and noncyclical downturns and to consistently maximize our profitability we continuously seek to maximize the variability of our cost structure and to reduce per unit and fixed costs our incentive compensation plans at all employee levels are based on both divisional and consolidated company performance performancebased incentive compensation is 

designed to reward high productivity and efficient use of physical resources and capital employed additionally leveraging existing facilities through capital effective organic growth and diversified product offerings allows us to maximize utilization of current cost structures our september 16 2014 columbus acquisition fits well within our portfolio as it is one of the most modern state of the art steel mills in north america 

secure supply of high quality justintime ferrous raw materials  develop metals recycling and ferrous resources business platform 

we maintain a secure supply of ferrous raw material resources through the benefit of our metals recycling operations as well as through our current ironmaking facilities ferrous materials represent the single largest raw material component of our steel operations excluding the techs manufacturing costs representing 65 of such costs in both 2014 and 2013 respectively during 2014 and 2013 our metals recycling operations provided our steel operations with 44 and 45 respectively of its ferrous scrap requirements based on volume during 2014 and 2013 our steel operations consumed 76 and 63 million tons respectively of metallic materials of which iron units other than scrap represented approximately 9 and 8 in 2014 and 2013 respectively our ironmaking operations internally supplied 92 excluding columbus and 95 of these iron units in 2014 and 2013 respectively through the transfer of liquid pig iron hot briquetted iron and iron nuggets which are higherquality and in the case of liquid pig and hot briquetted iron energysaving ferrous raw materials 

global steelmakers rely on ferrous scrap and the world demand for ferrous scrap has increased in nearly every year for the past ten years with the us being the worlds leading ferrous scrap exporter increased global demand may impact domestic scrap availability 

we believe our metals recycling and ferrous resources operations provide us with a high quality cost effective and secure raw material platform for effective working capital management and potential opportunities with other ventures we intend to continue to participate in the development of new technologies to increase the effectiveness of our metals recycling recovery capabilities 

diversified product mix  expand product offerings

industry segments 

we have three reporting segments steel operations metals recycling and ferrous resources operations and steel fabrication operations please refer to note 13 in the notes to consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 of this form 10k for financial information by segment 



steel operations consist of our six electric arc furnace steel mills producing steel from ferrous scrap utilizing continuous casting automated rolling mills and eight downstream steel coating facilities collectively our steel operations sell directly to end users and service centers these products are used in numerous industry sectors including the automotive construction commercial transportation agriculture industrial machinery pipe and tube and energy including octg markets the most significant portion of our products are tied to the automotive construction and other manufacturing sectors with less than 10 currently tied to the energy sector our steel operations accounted for 63 

61 and 62 of our consolidated net sales in 2014 2013 and 2012 respectively we are predominantly a domestic steel company with only 4 of our revenues exported during 2014 and 2013 

our steel operations segment consists of steelmaking and coating operations the following chart summarizes the locations and the current estimated production capacities of our facilities 



  



note capacities represent manufacturing capabilities based on mill configuration and related employee support these capacities do not represent expected volumes in a given year in addition estimates of mill capacity particularly rolling capacity are highly dependent on the specific product mix manufactured each of our mills can and do roll many different types and sizes of products therefore our capacity estimates assume a typical product mix 

the following chart summarizes our steel operations products and the percentage of sales tons by end market 

sheet products 

our sheet steel products consisting of hot roll cold roll and coated steel products are produced by our butler flat roll division columbus flat roll division acquired september 16 2014 and our downstream coating facilities our sheet operations represented 59 57 and 57 of this segments net sales in 2014 2013 and 2012 respectively we produced the following sheet steel at these facilities tons 



the following chart summarizes the types of sheet products we sold during the respective years 

sheet steel product mix 

customers steel processors and service centers typically act as intermediaries between primary steel producers and the many enduser manufacturers that require further processing of hot roll coils the additional processing performed by the intermediate steel processors and service centers include pickling galvanizing cutting to length slitting to size leveling blanking shape correcting edge rolling shearing and stamping we believe that our intermediate steel processor and service center customers will remain an integral part of our customer base the location of our columbus flat roll division capitalizes on growing industrial markets in the southern us and mexico and expands our customer base with the highstrength octg pipe grade and other line pipe products galvanized flat roll products produced by butler flat roll division columbus flat roll division and the techs are similar and are sold to a similar customer base however the techs facilities specialize in the galvanizing of specific types of flat roll steels in generally nonautomotive applications servicing a variety of customers in the heating ventilation and air conditioning hvac construction agriculture and consumer goods markets our sheet steel operations also provide a significant portion of the sheet steel utilized in our fabrication operations 

the following chart summarizes the types of customers who purchased our sheet steel products during the respective years 

sheet steel customers 

competition our sheet steelmaking operations compete with domestic and foreign integrated and electric arc furnace based hot roll coil producers additionally the global steel industry suffers from overcapacity and that excess capacity sometimes results in steel manufacturers in certain countries exporting steel at prices that are lower than prevailing domestic prices and sometimes at or below their cost of production such as 2014 when imports have been at record levels 

long products 

our structural and rail division is capable of producing a variety of parallel flange sections such as wide flange beams american standard beams manufactured housing beams h piling and channel sections for the construction transportation and industrial machinery markets they also produce standard strength carbon intermediate alloy hardness and premium grade rails in 40 to 320 feet lengths for the railroad industry our stateoftheart heat treating system expansion project was fully commissioned in 2014 this project allows us to produce highquality premium rail which is certified by all but one class i railroads in addition our railwelding facility has the ability to weld rails to lengths of 1600 feet which offers substantial savings to the railroads both in terms of initial capital cost and through reduced maintenance our structural and rail division produced 13 million tons and 12 million tons during 2014 and 2013 respectively of which 225000 tons and 206000 tons respectively was rail production 

our engineered bar products division is capable of producing a broad array of engineered specialbarquality sbq merchantbarquality mbq roundedcornered squares and smalldiameter engineered round bars as of december 31 2014 our smallerdiameter rolling mill expansion was fully commissioned the completion of the expansion increased the mills capacity to produce from 625000 tons to 950000 tons and expanded the mills product offering into highquality smalldiameter 1inch to 3inch precision sbq bars we produced 670000 tons and 498000 tons during 2014 and 2013 respectively at this facility adjacent to our engineered bar mill we have a bar finishing facility with an annual capacity of 260000 tons which provides various downstream finishing operations for our sbq steel bars processing operations include turning polishing straightening chamfering precision sawcutting and heattreating capabilities in addition nondestructive testing services are available including eddy current flux leakage and ultrasonic inspection 

our roanoke bar division sells angles merchant rounds flats channels reinforcing bar and billets in both 2014 and 2013 our roanoke bar division produced 601000 tons of billets and during 2014 and 2013 produced 432000 tons and 479000 tons of finished steel products respectively 

steel of west virginia primarily sells beams channels and specialty steel sections unlike most other mills steel of west virginia frequently performs fabrication and finishing operations on its products such as cutting to length additional straightening hole punching shot blasting welding and coating through this additional finishing we create custom finished products that are generally placed directly into our customers assembly operations we produced 294000 tons and 297000 tons of various merchant and structural steel products at steel of west virginia during 2014 and 2013 respectively 

customers the principal customers for our structural steel products are steel service centers steel fabricators and various manufacturers service centers though not the ultimate enduser provide valuable mill distribution functions to the fabricators and manufacturers including small quantity sales repackaging cutting preliminary processing and warehousing the steel rail marketplace in the united states canada and mexico is specialized and defined with seven class i railroads and a large distribution network we supply rail in 80 feet lengths and continuous welded rail cwr in lengths up to 1600 feet throughout north america 

sbq products are principally consumed by cold finishers forgers intermediate processors oem manufacturers steel service centers and distributors our mbq products are sold primarily to steel service centers as well as rebar distributors joist producers and oems some of the excess steel billet production at the roanoke bar division is sold to mills without sufficient melting capacities including our steel of west virginia facility our steel fabrication operations also purchase angles from our roanoke facility steel of west virginias customers are primarily oems producing truck trailers industrial lift trucks merchant products guardrail posts manufactured housing mining and offhighway construction equipment steel of west virginias flexible manufacturing capabilities enable us to meet demand for a variety of customordered and designed products many of these products are produced in small quantities for low volume end uses resulting in a wide variety of customers the largest of which are in the truck trailer and industrial lift truck industries 

competition our structural steel products compete with various electric arc furnace structural steelmakers some of which have cost structures and flexible management cultures similar to our own and we compete with alternative structural and manufacturing materials we also believe however that both geography and product choice play significant roles there are currently no other structural mills located in the midwest one of the largest structural steel consuming regions in the us and we provide customer service benefits to service centers fabricators and manufacturers located in the region we provide a broad product mix focusing on the midrange and larger sections served only by a few other competitors from locations more remote than our facility most of canadas structural steel consumption is located in canadas eastern provinces closer to us than our two largest competitors 

at present the rail market is principally served by two other domestic producers who have the capability to produce either standard or premium rail however they are limited to producing rail in 80 feet lengths and do not own welding operations we can produce rail in lengths up to 320 feet and weld to lengths of 1600 feet requiring far fewer welds for our rail customers there are currently no rail producers in canada and mexico global competitors include high quality integrated and electric arc furnace steel producers in europe and asia 

our engineered bar division competes with a number of other domestic producers of sbq and mbq we are among the largest and most diversified suppliers of engineered sbq in north america our customer service centralized geographic location justintime delivery and vendor management inventory program further differentiates us from other suppliers steel west virginia competes in the specialty shape products market with other domestic and european operations by being able to provide small quantity niche products unique to our customer manufacturing capabilities 



this operating segment primarily includes our metals recycling operations omnisource liquid pig iron production facility iron dynamics and minnesota ironmaking operations our metals recycling and ferrous resources operations segment accounted for 28 32 and 32 of our consolidated net sales in 2014 2013 and 2012 respectively 

metals recycling 

omnisource includes both ferrous and nonferrous scrap metal processing transportation marketing brokerage and consulting services in over 90 locations placed primarily in the midwest and southeast portion of the united states and are the most significant source of income in this segment in addition omnisource designs installs and manages customized scrap management programs for industrial manufacturing companies at over 500 locations throughout north america our metals recycling operations represented 87 91 and 94 of this segments net sales during 2014 2013 and 2012 respectively our steel mills utilize a portion of the ferrous scrap processed through omnisource as raw material in our steelmaking operations and the remainder is sold to other consumers such as other steel manufacturers and foundries in 2014 2013 and 2012 omnisource supplied our steel mills with approximately 44 45 and 51 respectively of the tons of their ferrous raw material requirements representing approximately 48 44 and 46 respectively of omnisources 2014 2013 and 2012 ferrous shipped tons 

omnisource processed andor brokered approximately 56 million gross tons and 55 million gross tons of ferrous material during 2014 and 2013 respectively and approximately 12 billion pounds and 11 billion pounds of nonferrous material during 2014 and 2013 respectively during 2014 and 2013 approximately 7 and 6 respectively of omnisources revenue were from export sales primarily from nonferrous materials 

we sell various grades of processed ferrous scrap to steel mills and foundries ferrous scrap metal is the primary raw material for electric arc furnaces such as our steel mills in addition we sell various grades of nonferrous metals such as copper brass aluminum and stainless steel to aluminum steel and ingot manufacturers brass and bronze ingot makers copper refineries and mill smelters specialty mills alloy manufacturers and other consumers 

we purchase ferrous and nonferrous scrap metals processed and unprocessed in a variety of forms for our metals recycling facilities 

ferrous scrap comes from two primary sources 

• manufacturers and industrial plants metal fabrication plants machine shops and factories which generate ferrous scrap referred to as prompt or industrial scrap and • scrap dealers retail individuals auto wreckers demolition firms and others who generate steel and iron scrap referred to as obsolete scrap obsolete scrap includes postconsumer waste demolition of steel structures and automobiles and represents a significant source of scrap generation nonferrous scrap comes from three primary sources 

• manufacturers and other nonferrous scrap sources which generate or sell scrap aluminum copper stainless steel and other nonferrous metals • producers of electric wire telecommunication service providers aerospace defense and recycling companies that generate nonferrous scrap consisting primarily of copper wire aluminum beverage cans and various other metals and alloys and 11 

• retail individuals who sell material directly to our facilities which they collect from a variety of sources we do not purchase a material amount of scrap metal from a single source or from a limited number of major sources market demand and the composition quality size weight and location of the materials are the primary factors that determine prices 

products our metals recycling operations primarily involve the purchase processing and resale of ferrous and nonferrous scrap metals into reusable forms and grades we process an array of ferrous products through a variety of methods including sorting shredding shearing cutting torching baling briquetting and breaking our major ferrous products include heavy melting steel busheling bundled scrap shredded scrap and other scrap metal products such as steel turnings and cast iron these products vary in properties or attributes related to cleanness size of individual pieces and residual alloys the necessary characteristics of the ferrous products are determined by the specific needs and requirements of the consumer and affect the individual products relative value in addition we process various grades of nonferrous products including aluminum brass copper stainless steel and other nonferrous metals additionally we provide transportation logistics truck rail and river barge management services marketing brokerage and consulting services related to the scrap industry 

customers we sell various grades of processed ferrous scrap to endusers such as electric arc furnace steel mills integrated steelmakers foundries secondary smelters and metal brokers who aggregate materials for other large users ferrous scrap metal is the primary raw material for electric arc furnaces such as our steel mills most of our ferrous scrap customers purchase processed scrap through negotiated spot sales contracts which establish a quantity purchase for the month the price we charge for ferrous scrap depends upon market demand and pricing transportation costs as well as the quality and grade of the scrap we sell various grades of processed nonferrous scrap to endusers such as aluminum sheet and ingot manufacturers brass and bronze ingot makers copper refineries mills smelters specialty steelmakers alloy manufacturers wire and cable producers utilities and telephone networks the price we charge for nonferrous scrap depends upon market demand and pricing transportation costs as well as the quality and grade of the scrap 

competition scrap is a global commodity influenced by conditions in a number of industrialized and emergingmarkets throughout asia europe and north america the markets for scrap metals are highly competitive both in the purchase of raw or unprocessed scrap and the sale of processed scrap with regard to the purchase of raw scrap we compete with numerous independent recyclers as well as smaller scrap companies engaged only in collecting obsolete scrap in many cases we also purchase unprocessed scrap metal from smaller scrap dealers and other processors successful procurement of materials is determined primarily by the price offered by the purchaser for the raw scrap and the proximity of our processing facility to the source of the raw scrap both ferrous and nonferrous scrap sells as a commodity in both national and international markets which are affected by relative economic conditions currency fluctuations and the availability and cost of transportation competition for sales of processed scrap is based primarily on the price quality and location of the scrap metals as well as the level of service provided in terms of reliability and timing of delivery 

we also face potential competition for sales of processed scrap from other producers of steel products such as electric arc furnace and integrated steel mills some of which are vertically integrated in the scrap metals recycling business in addition other steel mills may compete with us in attempting to secure scrap supply through direct purchasing from our scrap suppliers scrap metal processors also face competition from substitutes for prepared ferrous scrap such as prereduced iron pellets hot briquetted iron pig iron direct reduced iron and other forms of processed iron the availability and relative prices of substitutes for ferrous scrap could result in a decreased demand for processed ferrous scrap and could result in lower prices andor lower demand for our scrap products 

the industry is highly fragmented with many smaller familyowned companies many regional scrap companies along with a number of national and global companies each of which has multiple locations in areas in which omnisource also operates no single scrap metals recycler has a significant market share in the domestic market 

ferrous resources 

our ferrous resource operations consist of our two ironmaking initiatives iron dynamics idi a liquid pig iron production facility and our minnesota ironmaking operations consisting of an iron nugget production facility and operations to supply the nugget facility with its primary raw material iron concentrate 

iron dynamics 

idi produces liquid pig iron and hot briquetted iron hbi that serves as a substitute for a portion of the metallic raw material mix that goes into our electric arc furnaces to produce steel direct reduced iron dri is a metallic product made from mill scale and iron ore fines that has been reduced in a rotary hearth furnace using natural gas and coal the reduction method employed by idi uses coal as the reducing agent the dri is either compacted by briquetters to form hbi or is processed further to produce liquid pig iron hbi can be immediately used in our melting furnaces or stockpiled for later use liquid pig iron is tapped from idis submerged arc furnace and immediately transferred in ladles to the adjacent butler flat roll division where it is combined with ferrous scrap in the mills electric arc furnaces 

idis primary focus is to maximize liquid pig iron production due to the inherent economic benefits achieved when the material is used in the steelmaking process such as reduced energy cost reduced materials cost and quicker melting cycles during 2014 and 2013 respectively idi produced 250000 and 255000 metric tons of which 93 and 94 was liquid pig iron we have used and plan to continue to use all of the facilitys output in our butler flat roll division steelmaking operations 

minnesota ironmaking operations—mesabi nugget mesabi mining and mining resources 

our minnesota ironmaking operations consists of mesabi nugget owned 82 by us our iron concentrate and potential future iron mining operations mesabi mining and our iron tailings operations mining resources owned 81 by us mesabi nugget is the worlds first commercial ironmaking facility to use the itmk3® process an ironnugget production technology pioneered by kobe steel ltd which they are licensing to the venture the facilitys estimated annual production capacity is 430000 metric tons in 2014 2013 and 2012 mesabi nugget produced 241000 214000 and 178000 metric tons of iron nuggets respectively for use by our own steel mills we have experienced operational quality control or production cost challenges in implementing this ironmaking process and have continued to modify reengineer and further refine this process we have also changed or modified equipment configurations with resulting increased plant availability increased production and improved quality during the fourth quarter of 2014 our minnesota ironmaking operations and mesabi nugget specifically reached a steady operating state indicating a consistency in the operations production capability processes and cost structure including the ability to utilize certain lowercost raw materials given this we undertook an assessment of the recoverability of the carrying value of our minnesota ironmaking operations fixed assets with our current outlook regarding future operating costs and product pricing we concluded that the carrying value of these fixed assets was no longer fully recoverable and the fixed assets were in fact impaired this assessment resulted in a 2600 million impairment charge including amounts attributable to noncontrolling interests of 465 million recorded in the metals recycling and ferrous resources operating segment please refer to note 1 in the notes to consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 of this form 10k for information regarding the impairment charge 

our mining resources operations which involve the extraction of iron tailings from previously developed stockpiles or water filled tailings basins provide iron ore tailings to be concentrated for use by mesabi nugget as lowcost iron concentrate to the nugget production process mining resources started operations in 2012 and effectively ramped up operations in 2013 producing 407000 and 400000 metric tons of iron concentrate during 2013 and 2014 respectively however in 2014 we experienced higher costs due to reduced iron recovery rates from the tailings basins prompting the need to install enhanced recovery equipment which is taking place in the first quarter of 2015 due to this and a temporary excess supply of nugget inventory at our steel mills we have decided to warmidle our minnesota ironmaking operations for a period of 6 to 8 weeks beginning in midfebruary 2015 



our steel fabrication operations include six new millennium building systems plants that primarily serve the nonresidential construction industry our facilities located in butler indiana lake city florida salem virginia hope arkansas fallon nevada and juarez mexico give us a national operating footprint that allows us to serve the entire us construction market as well as national accounts such as large retail chains 

steel fabrication operations accounted for 7 6 and 5 of our consolidated net sales during 2014 2013 and 2012 respectively we sold 481000 tons and 367000 tons of joist and deck products during 2014 and 2013 respectively our steel operations supply a substantial portion approximately 51 in 2014 of the steel utilized in our fabrication manufacturing operations 

products our fabrication operations produce steel building components including steel joists girders trusses and steel decking our individual joist products include bowstring arched scissor doublepitched and singlepitched joists our indiana florida virginia and arkansas plants also produce a full range of steel roof form and composite floor decking 

customers our primary fabrication customers are nonresidential steel fabricators other customers include metal building companies general construction contractors developers brokers and governmental entities our customers are located throughout the united states including national accounts 

markets our fabrication operations primarily serve the nonresidential construction industry the steel joist and deck market in the us was approximately 13 million tons in 2012 increased to 15 million tons in 2013 and further increased to 17 million tons in 2014 based on trade association estimates based on this information our fabrication operations growth rate outpaced the steel joist and deck market growth in each of 2014 and 2013 by 11 and 14 respectively this resulted in our market share increasing in 2014 to approximately 30 from that in 2013 of approximately 27 we believe we are well positioned with our national footprint to continue to grow as the market continues to strengthen as we have unused capacity that can be deployed as needed 

competition we compete with other north american joist and steel decking producers primarily on the basis of price quality customer service and proximity to the customer our national footprint allows us to service the entire us construction market as well as national accounts such as large retail chains 

sources availability and cost of steel and other operations raw materials 

scrap metals the principal raw material of our steel operations segment is scrap metal derived from among other sources home scrap generated internally at steel mills themselves industrial scrap generated as a byproduct of manufacturing and obsolete scrap recycled from endoflife 

automobiles appliances railroad cars and railroad track materials agricultural machinery and demolition scrap from obsolete structures containers and machines 

ferrous scrap typically comprises more than 80 of the metallic melt mix in electric arc furnace steelmaking in contrast to integrated mill steelmaking where the proportion of scrap has traditionally been approximately 25 to 35 depending upon the scrap substitute material that may be available from time to time and the relative cost of such material the percentage of scrap used in our steelmaking operations could be increased or reduced in our metallic melt mix 

many variables can impact scrap prices all of which reflect the pushes and pulls of the supply demand equation these factors include the level of us steel production for highquality lowresidual scrap is a byproduct of steel manufacturing activity the level of exports of scrap from the united states the amount of obsolete scrap production generally as domestic steel demand increases so does scrap demand and resulting scrap prices the reverse is also normally but not always true with scrap prices following steel prices downward when supply exceeds demand 

the following table provides pricing per gross ton from american metal market amm and iron age pig iron estimates for ferrous materials used in steel production 

ferrous material pricing 

the price of ferrous scrap as a commodity has tended to be volatile rising and falling with supply and demand and not always in lock step with or in proportion to the market price of steel when scrap costs greatly accelerate this threatens one of the principal elements of an electric arc furnace based steel mills traditional lower cost structure—the cost of its metallic raw material therefore having a lower cost alternative source of iron for a portion of a mills melt mix if realizable would partially buffer the effects of high scrap prices and scrap price volatility with the growing proportion of electric arc furnace steel production both worldwide and domestically we believe that the benefit of developing a costeffective alternate iron source as a hedge to augment scrap our primary raw material makes good economic sense in the long run 

iron units in addition to scrap direct reduced iron hot briquetted iron pig iron and iron nuggets are used in electric arc furnace steel mill production during 2014 and 2013 we consumed 

76 million tons and 63 million tons respectively of metallic materials in our steelmaking furnaces of which iron units other than scrap represented approximately 9 and 8 of the tons in 2014 and 2013 respectively of these iron substitute units consumed our iron dynamics and minnesota ironmaking operations together supplied 92 excluding columbus and 95 of these iron units in 2014 and 2013 respectively 

energy resources 

electricity electricity is a significant input required in the electric arc furnaces in our steelmaking operations excluding the techs representing 5 of steel production costs of goods sold in 2014 and 2013 we have entered into a fixed price interruptible electricity supply agreement that extends through december 31 2015 for our butler flat roll division the contract allows our supplier to interrupt service in the event of an emergency or in response to various market conditions our columbus flat roll division roanoke bar division and steel of west virginia have entered into fixed price contracts while our engineered bar products division has a combination of fixed pricing and market pricing for the various components of the electrical services demand charge energy charge riders etc our structural and rail division purchases electricity at current market prices 

natural gas we purchase a portion of our steel operations natural gas requirements at market prices and a portion by entering into hedging transactions on the futures markets for ultimate physical delivery in order to help minimize price volatility these contracts typically have duration of up to 24 months but on occasion may extend further natural gas represented 15 and 13 of steel operations excluding the techs costs of goods sold in 2014 and 2013 respectively 

patents and trademarks 

we currently do not own any material patents or patent applications for technologies that are in use in our production processes we have seven major registered trademarks as follows 

• the mark sdi and a chevron alone • the mark sdi and a chevron and steel dynamics inc to the right of the chevron • the mark sdi and a chevron and steel dynamics to the right of the chevron • the mark omnisource corporation with the circle logo design • the slogan the best in metals recycling • the mark the techs and • the mark new millennium building systems llc research and development 

our research and development efforts have consisted of efforts to develop or improve our products and operating processes and our efforts to develop and improve alternative ironmaking technologies through iron dynamics and our minnesota ironmaking operations most of these research and development efforts have been conducted inhouse by our employees 

environmental matters 

our operations are subject to substantial and evolving local state and federal environmental health and safety laws and regulations concerning among other things emissions to the air discharges to surface and ground water and to sewer systems and the generation handling storage transportation treatment and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes our manufacturing operations are dependent upon permits regulating discharges into the air or into the water or the use and handling of 

byproducts in order to operate our facilities we dedicate considerable resources aimed at achieving material compliance with federal and state laws concerning the environment while we do not currently believe that our future compliance efforts with such provisions will have a material adverse effect on our results of operations cash flows or financial condition this is subject to change in the evolving regulatory environment in which we operate 

since the level of enforcement of environmental laws and regulations or the nature of those laws that may be enacted from time to time are subject to changing social or political pressures our environmental capital expenditures and costs for environmental compliance may increase in the future in addition due to the possibility of unanticipated regulatory or other developments the amount and timing of future environmental expenditures may vary substantially from those currently anticipated the cost of current and future environmental compliance may also place us steel producers at a competitive disadvantage with respect to foreign steel producers which may not be required to undertake equivalent costs in their operations 

pursuant to the resource conservation and recovery act or rcra which governs the treatment handling and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes the united states environmental protection agency or us epa and authorized state environmental agencies may conduct inspections to identify areas where there may have been releases of solid or hazardous constituents into the environment and require the facilities to take corrective action to remediate any such releases rcra also allows citizens to bring certain suits against regulated facilities for potential damages and cleanup our steelmaking and certain other facilities generate wastes subject to rcra our manufacturing operations produce various byproducts some of which for example electric arc furnace or eaf dust are categorized as solid or hazardous waste requiring special handling for disposal or for the recovery of metallics we collect such byproducts in pollution controlled equipment such as baghouses and either dispose of or recycle these byproducts while we cannot predict the future actions of the regulators or other interested parties the potential exists for required corrective action at these facilities the costs of which could be substantial 

under the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act or cercla the us epa and in some instances private parties have the authority to impose joint and several liability for the remediation of contaminated properties upon generators of waste current and former site owners and operators transporters and other potentially responsible parties regardless of fault or the legality of the original disposal activity many states have statutes and regulatory authorities similar to cercla and to the us epa we have a number of material handling agreements with various contractors to properly dispose of or recycle our electric arc furnace dust and certain other byproducts of our operations however we cannot assure that even if there has been no fault by us we may not still be cited as a waste generator by reason of an environmental cleanup at a site to which our byproducts were transported 

the clean water act and similar state laws apply to aspects of our operations and impose regulatory burdens related to the discharge of wastewater stormwater and dredged or fill material us epa states and in certain instances private parties have the ability to bring suit alleging violations and seeking penalties and damages the clean water acts provisions can require new or expanded water treatment investments to be made and can limit or even prohibit certain current or planned activities at our operations 

the clean air act and analogous state laws require many of our facilities to obtain and maintain air permits in order to operate air permits can impose new or expanded obligations to limit or prevent current or future emissions and to add costly pollution control equipment enforcement can be brought by us epa the states and in certain instance private parties and can result in large penalties and injunctive relief 

in addition there are a number of other environmental health and safety laws and regulations that apply to our facilities and may affect our operations by way of example and not of limitation certain portions of the federal toxic substances control act oil pollution act safe drinking water act and emergency planning and community righttoknow act as well as state and local laws and regulations implemented by the regulatory agencies apply to aspects of our facilities operations many of these laws allow both the governments and citizens to bring certain suits against regulated facilities for alleged environmental violations finally any steelmaking and metals recycling company could be subject to certain toxic tort suits brought by citizens or other third parties alleging causes of action such as nuisance negligence trespass infliction of emotional distress or other claims alleging personal injury or property damage 

employees 

we emphasize decentralized decisionmaking and responsibility and have established performancebased incentive compensation programs specifically designed to enhance productivity improve profitability control costs and foster innovation our work force consisted of approximately 7780 full time employees at december 31 2014 of which approximately 9 were represented by collective bargaining agreements the largest group of unionized employees is at steel of west virginia the remaining unionized employees are located in five different omnisource metals recycling locations each of which has its own agreement we believe that our relationship with our employees is good

 item 1a risk factors 

  many factors could have an effect on our financial condition cash flows and results of operations we are subject to various risks resulting from changing economic environmental political industry business and financial conditions the factors described below represent our principal risks 

risks related to our industry 

our industry is affected by domestic and global economic factors including the risk of a new or prolonged recession 

our financial results are substantially dependent not only upon overall economic conditions in the united states in europe and in asia but also as they may affect one or more of the industries upon which we depend for the sale of our products prolongation of the recovery from the recession that began in 2008 could stifle improving customer confidence and adversely affect demand for our products and further adversely affect our business metals industries have historically been vulnerable to significant declines in consumption and product pricing during periods of economic downturn or continued uncertainty including the pace of domestic nonresidential construction activity 

our business is also dependent upon certain industries such as automotive commercial residential and government construction transportation agriculture industrial machinery pipe and tube energy original equipment manufacturing and metals service center industries and these industries are also cyclical in nature therefore these industries may experience their own fluctuations in demand for our products based on such things as economic conditions energy prices consumer demand and infrastructure funding decisions by governments many of these factors are beyond our control as a result of volatility in our industry or in the industries we serve we may have difficulty increasing or maintaining our level of sales or profitability if the industries we serve were to suffer a downturn then our business may be adversely affected 

our level of production and our sales and earnings are subject to significant fluctuations as a result of the cyclical nature of the steel industry and some of the industries we serve 

the steel manufacturing business is cyclical in nature and the selling price of the steel we make may fluctuate significantly due to many factors beyond our control furthermore many of our products are commodities subject to their own cyclical fluctuations in supply and demand in both metal consuming and metal generating industries including the construction industry the timing magnitude and duration of these cycles and the resulting price fluctuations are difficult to predict the sale of our manufactured steel products is directly affected by demand for our products in other cyclical industries such as automotive commercial residential and government construction transportation agriculture industrial machinery pipe and tube energy original equipment manufacturing and metals service center industries economic difficulties stagnant global economies supplydemand imbalances and currency fluctuations in the united states or globally could decrease the demand for our products or increase the amount of imports of steel into the united states which could decrease our sales margins and profitability 

the scrap metal recycling industry has historically been and is expected to remain highly cyclical and this could have a material adverse effect on our metals recycling operations results 

scrap metal prices have become increasingly volatile and operating results within the metals recycling industry in general have historically been cyclical and are expected to remain highly cyclical in nature similarly but not necessarily paralleling the price fluctuations in the steel business the purchase prices for automobile bodies and various other grades of obsolete and industrial scrap as well as the selling prices for processed and recycled scrap metals we utilize in our own manufacturing process or which we resell to others through our metals recycling operations are also highly volatile 

during periods of increased imports scrap metal prices may become depressed and adversely affect the sales profitability and margins of our scrap business as a metals recycler we may attempt to respond to changing recycled metal selling prices by adjusting the scrap metal purchase prices we pay to others but our ability to do this may be limited by competitive or other factors during periods of low scrap prices when inbound scrap flow may slow considerably as scrap generators hold on to their scrap in hopes of getting higher prices later as such a prolonged period of low scrap prices could reduce our ability to obtain process and sell recycled materials and this could adversely affect our metals recycling operations results conversely periodic increased foreign demand for scrap can result in an outflow of available domestic scrap as well as resulting higher scrap prices domestically that cannot always be passed on to domestic scrap consumers thereby further reducing available domestic scrap flows and scrap margins all of which could adversely affect our sales and profitability of our scrap business additionally during periods of high demand and resulting higher scrap prices ferrous scrap consumers may seek and develop ferrous scrap alternatives including pig iron and direct reduced iron the availability and pricing of these scrap alternatives in the domestic market may have a longer term impact on scrap pricing particularly in prime grades which could adversely affect our sales profitability and margins 

imports of steel into the united states have adversely affected and may again adversely affect united states steel prices which could impact our sales margins and profitability 

global steelmaking capacity currently exceeds global consumption of steel products such excess capacity sometimes results in steel manufacturers in certain countries exporting steel at prices that are lower than prevailing domestic prices and sometimes at or below their cost of production excessive imports of steel into the united states such as the record levels in 2014 have exerted and may continue to exert downward pressure on us steel prices which negatively affects our ability to increase our sales margins and profitability this may also adversely impact domestic demand for ferrous scrap and our ferrous metallics margins us steel producers compete with many foreign producers including those in china competition from foreign producers is typically strong and is periodically exacerbated by weakening of the economies of certain foreign steelmaking countries a higher volume of steel exports to the us tend to occur at depressed prices when steel producing countries experience periods of economic difficulty decreased demand for steel products or excess capacity 

in addition we believe the downward pressure on and periodically depressed levels of us steel prices in some recent years have been further exacerbated by imports of steel involving dumping and subsidy abuses by foreign steel producers some foreign steel producers are owned controlled or subsidized by foreign governments as a result decisions by these producers with respect to their production sales and pricing are sometimes influenced to a greater degree by political and economic policy considerations than by prevailing market conditions realities of the marketplace or consideration of profit or loss however while some tariffs and quotas are periodically put into effect for certain steel products imported from a number of countries that have been found to have been unfairly pricing steel imports to the us there is no assurance that tariffs and quotas will always be levied even if otherwise justified and even when imposed many of these are only shortlived when such tariffs or duties expire or if others are further relaxed or repealed or if relatively higher us steel prices make it attractive for foreign steelmakers to export their steel products to the us despite the presence of duties or tariffs the resurgence of substantial imports of foreign steel could create downward pressure on us steel prices 

chinas current steelmaking overcapacity in relation to its steel consumption could have a material adverse effect on domestic and global steel pricing and could result in increased steel imports into the united states 

the significant growth of new chinese steel production capacity that began in the 2000s coupled with the slowdown in chinese steel consumption that began in 2008 has resulted in chinese steel production capacity that far exceeds that countrys current demand and has made china a major global exporter of steel this combination of a slowdown in chinas economic growth and steel consumption and its own expansion of steelmaking capacity generally results in a weakening of steel pricing should chinese steelmaking capacity remain the same or further increase in relation to its demand china might not only remain a net exporter of steel but many asian and european steel producers whose steel output previously fed chinas steel import needs could redirect their steel into the us market through increased steel imports causing a further erosion of margins or negatively impacting our ability to increase our prices 

the worldwide economic downturn that began in 2008 and the difficult conditions in the global industrial capital and credit markets that resulted have adversely affected and may continue to adversely affect our industry as well as the industries of many of our customers and suppliers upon whom we are dependent 

many of the markets in which our customers participate such as automotive commercial residential and government construction transportation agriculture industrial machinery pipe and tube energy original equipment manufacturing and metals service center industries are cyclical in nature and experience significant fluctuations in demand for our steel products based on economic conditions consumer demand raw material and energy costs and decisions by our government to fund or not fund infrastructure projects such as highways bridges schools energy plants railroads and transportation facilities many of these factors are beyond our control these markets are highly competitive to a large extent driven by enduse markets and may experience overcapacity all of which may affect demand for and pricing of our products 

a decline in consumer and business confidence and spending together with reductions in the availability of credit or increased cost of credit as well as volatility in the capital and credit markets could adversely affect the business and economic environment in which we operate and the profitability of our business we are also exposed to risks associated with the creditworthiness of our suppliers and customers if the availability of credit to fund or support the continuation and expansion of our customers business operations is curtailed or if the cost of that credit is increased the resulting inability of our customers or of their customers to access either credit or absorb the increased cost of that credit could adversely affect our business by reducing our sales or by increasing our exposure to losses from uncollectible customer accounts a renewed disruption of the credit markets could also result in financial instability of some of our suppliers and customers the consequences of such adverse effects could include the interruption of production at the facilities of our customers the reduction delay or cancellation of customer orders delays or interruptions of the supply of raw materials we purchase and bankruptcy of customers suppliers or other creditors any of these events may adversely affect our profitability cash flow and financial condition 

volatility and major fluctuations in scrap metal and pig iron prices and our potential inability to pass higher costs on to our customers may constrain operating levels and reduce profit margins 

steel producers require large amounts of raw materials including scrap metal and scrap substitute products such as pig iron pelletized iron and other supplies such as graphite electrodes and ferroalloys our principal raw material is scrap metal derived primarily from junked automobiles industrial scrap railroad cars railroad track materials agricultural machinery and demolition scrap from obsolete structures containers and machines the prices for scrap are subject to market forces largely beyond our control including demand by us and international steel producers freight costs and speculation the prices for scrap have varied significantly may vary significantly in the future and do not necessarily 

fluctuate in tandem with the price of steel moreover some of our integrated steel producer competitors are not as dependent as we are on scrap as a part of their raw material melt mix which during periods of high scrap costs relative to the cost of blast furnace iron used by the integrated producers give them a raw material cost advantage over minimills while our vertical integration into the metals recycling business through our omnisource operations and into the ironmaking business through our iron dynamics facility and our minnesota ironmaking operations should enable us to continue being a costeffective supplier to our steelmaking operations for some of our metallics requirements we will still need to rely on other metallics and raw material suppliers as well as upon general industry supply conditions for the balance of our needs 

purchase prices for auto bodies scrap metal and scrap substitute products such as pig iron that we consume and selling prices for scrap and recycled metals that we sell to third parties are volatile and beyond our control while omnisource attempts to respond to changing recycled metal selling prices through adjustments to its metal purchase prices its ability to do so is limited by competitive and other market factors changing prices could potentially impact the volume of scrap metal available to us and the volume and realized margins of processed metals we sell 

the availability and prices of raw materials may also be negatively affected by new laws and regulations allocation by suppliers interruptions in production accidents or natural disasters changes in exchange rates worldwide price fluctuations and the availability and cost of transportation 

if prices for ferrous metallics increase by a greater margin than corresponding price increases for the sale of our steel products we may not be able to recoup such cost increases from increases in the selling prices of steel products conversely depressed prices for ferrous scrap may constrain its supply which may adversely affect our metals recycling operations and also the availability of certain grades of scrap for our steelmaking operations additionally our inability to pass on all or any substantial part of any cost increases during periods of rapidly rising scrap prices through scrap or other surcharges or to provide for our customers needs because of the potential unavailability of key raw materials or other inputs may result in production curtailments or may otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations or prospects 

the cost and availability of electricity and natural gas are also subject to volatile market conditions 

steel producers like us consume large amounts of energy inasmuch as minimills melt ferrous scrap in electric arc furnaces and use natural gas to reheat steel or steel billets for rolling into finished products we rely on third parties for the supply of energy resources we consume in our steelmaking activities the prices for and availability of electricity natural gas oil and other energy resources are also subject to volatile market conditions often affected by weather conditions as well as political and economic factors beyond our control as large consumers of electricity and gas we must have dependable delivery in order to operate accordingly we are at risk in the event of an energy disruption prolonged blackouts or brownouts or disruptions caused by natural disasters or by political considerations would substantially disrupt our production in addition a significant portion of our finished steel products are delivered by truck unforeseen fluctuations in the price of fuel attributable to fluctuations in crude oil prices would also have a negative impact on our costs or on the costs of many of our customers in addition changes in certain environmental regulations in the us including those that may impose output limitations or higher costs associated with climate change or greenhouse gas emissions legislation could substantially increase the cost of manufacturing and raw materials such as energy to us and other us steel producers 

fluctuations in the value of the united states dollar relative to other currencies may adversely affect our business 

fluctuations in the value of the dollar can be expected to affect our business a strong us dollar such as was experienced in 2014 makes imported metal products less expensive potentially resulting in more imports of steel products into the us by our foreign competitors while a weak us dollar may have the opposite impact on imports 

compliance with and changes in environmental and remediation requirements could result in substantially increased capital requirements and operating costs 

existing laws or regulations as currently interpreted or as may be interpreted in the future as well as future laws or regulations may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

we are subject to comprehensive local state federal and international statutory and regulatory environmental requirements relating to among other things 

• the acceptance storage treatment handling and disposal of solid and hazardous waste • the discharge of materials into the air including periodic changes to the national ambient air quality standards and to emission standards • the management and treatment of wastewater and storm water • the remediation of soil and groundwater contamination • global climate change legislation or regulation • the need for and the ability to timely obtain air water or other operating permits • the timely reporting of certain chemical usage content storage and releases • the remediation and reclamation of land used for iron mining • natural resource damages and • the protection of our employees health and safety compliance with environmental laws and regulations which affect our steelmaking metals recycling and ironmaking operations is a significant factor in our business we are required to obtain and comply with environmental permits and licenses and failure to obtain or renew or the violation of any permit or license could result in substantial fines and penalties suspension of operations andor the closure of a subject facility similarly delays increased costs andor the imposition of onerous conditions to the securing or renewal of operating permits such as those required by our minnesota ironmaking operations could have a material adverse effect on these operations 

private parties might also bring claims against us under citizen suit provisions andor for alleged property damage or personal injury resulting from the environmental impacts of our operations moreover legal requirements change frequently are subject to interpretation and have tended to become more stringent over time uncertainty regarding adequate pollution control levels testing and sampling procedures and new pollution control technology are factors that may increase our future compliance expenditures we are unable to predict the ultimate cost of future compliance with these requirements or their effect on our operations although we work hard to be in substantial compliance with all applicable laws and regulations legal requirements frequently change and are subject to interpretation new laws regulations and changing interpretations by regulatory authorities together with uncertainty regarding adequate pollution control levels testing and sampling procedures and evolving pollution control technology are among the factors that may increase our future expenditures 

to comply with environmental requirements the cost of complying with existing laws or regulations as currently interpreted or reinterpreted in the future or with future laws or regulations may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

our manufacturing and recycling operations produce significant amounts of byproducts some of which are handled as solid or hazardous waste for example our mills generate electric arc furnace eaf dust which the united states environmental protection agency us epa and other regulatory authorities classify as hazardous waste and regulate accordingly 

in addition the primary feed materials for the shredders operated by our metals recycling operations include automobile hulks and obsolete household appliances a portion of the feed materials consist of unrecyclable material known as shredder residue if laws or regulations the interpretation of the laws or regulations or testing methods change with regard to eaf dust or shredder residue we may incur significant additional expenditures 

the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act cercla or superfund enables the us epa state agencies and certain private parties to recover from owners operators generators and transporters the cost of investigation and cleanup of sites at which hazardous substances were disposed in connection with cercla and analogous state laws we may be required to clean up contamination discovered at our sites including contamination that may have been caused by former owners or operators of the sites to conduct additional cleanup at sites that have already had some cleanup performed andor to perform cleanup with regard to sites formerly used in connection with our operations 

in addition we may be required to pay for or to pay a portion of the costs of cleanup at sites to which we sent materials for disposal or recycling notwithstanding that the original disposal or recycling activity may have complied with all regulatory requirements then in effect pursuant to cercla a party can be held jointly and severally liable for all of the cleanup costs associated with a disposal site in practice a liable party often splits the costs of cleanup with other potentially responsible parties we have received notices from the us epa state agencies and third parties that we have been identified as potentially responsible for the cost of investigating and cleaning up a number of disposal sites in most cases many other parties are also named as potentially responsible parties 

because cercla can be imposed retroactively on shipments that occurred many years ago and because the us epa and state agencies are still discovering sites that pose a threat to public health or the environment we can provide no assurance that we will not become liable for significant costs associated with investigation and remediation of cercla cleanup sites 

cercla including the superfund recycling equity act of 1999 limits the exposure of scrap metal recyclers for sales of certain recyclable material under certain circumstances however the recycling defense is subject to a number of limitations and may be found not to apply to all instances of recycling activity that we conduct 

increased regulation associated with climate change and greenhouse gas emissions could impose significant additional costs on both our steelmaking and metals recycling operations 

the united states government or various governmental agencies may introduce additional regulatory changes in response to the potential impacts of climate change international treaties or agreements may also result in increasing regulation of greenhouse gas emissions including the introduction of carbon emissions trading mechanisms any such regulation regarding climate change and greenhouse gas or ghg emissions could impose significant costs on our steelmaking and metals recycling operations and on the operations of our customers and suppliers including increased energy capital equipment environmental monitoring and reporting and other costs in order to comply with current or future laws or regulations concerning and limitations imposed on our operations by virtue of 

climate change and ghg emissions laws and regulations any adopted future climate change and ghg regulations could negatively impact our ability and that of our customers and suppliers to compete with companies situated in areas not subject to such limitations 

from a medium and longterm perspective we are likely to see an increase in costs relating to our assets that emit significant amounts of greenhouse gases as a result of these regulatory initiatives these regulatory initiatives may impact our operations directly or through our suppliers or customers until the timing scope and extent of any future regulation becomes known we cannot predict the effect on our financial condition operating performance and ability to compete 

risks related to the business 

our senior secured credit facility contains and any future financing agreements may contain restrictive covenants that may limit our flexibility 

restrictions and covenants in our existing debt agreements including our senior secured credit facility and any future financing agreements may impair our ability to finance future operations or capital needs or to engage in other business activities specifically these agreements may limit or restrict our ability to 

• incur additional indebtedness • pay dividends or make distributions with respect to our capital stock in excess of certain amounts • repurchase or redeem capital stock • make some investments • create liens on property • make some capital expenditures • enter into transactions with affiliates or related persons • issue or sell stock of certain subsidiaries • sell or transfer assets and • enter into mergers  acquisitions or consolidations or some joint ventures a breach of any of the restrictions or covenants could cause a default under our senior secured credit facility our senior notes or our other debt a significant portion of our indebtedness then may become immediately due and payable if the default is not remedied 

under our senior secured credit facility we are required to maintain certain financial covenants tied to our leverage and profitability our ability to meet such covenants or other restrictions can be affected by events beyond our control if a default were to occur the lenders could elect to declare all amounts then outstanding to be immediately due and payable and terminate all commitments to extend further credit if we are unable to repay those amounts the lenders could proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure such indebtedness we have pledged substantially all of our receivables and inventories and all shares of capital stock or other equity interests of our subsidiaries and intercompany debt held by us as collateral for our senior secured credit facility 

we may face significant price and other forms of competition from other steel producers scrap processors and alternative materials which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operation or prospects 

the global markets in which steel companies and scrap processors conduct business are highly competitive and became even more so due to the recent global economic downturn and consolidations in the steel and scrap industries additionally in many applications steel competes with other materials such as aluminum cement composites plastics carbon fiber glass and wood increased use of alternative materials could decrease demand for steel and combined with increased competition could cause us to lose market share increase expenditures or reduce pricing any one of which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations or prospects the global steel industry suffers from overcapacity and that excess capacity intensifies price competition in some of our products a decrease in the global demand for steel scrap due to market or other conditions generally causes a decrease in the price of scrap metals a decrease in price could result in some scrap generators exiting the marketplace which could further decrease the availability of scrap this shortage in availability of scrap could have a material adverse effect on both our steelmaking and our metals recycling operations and thus on our business financial condition results of operations or prospects 

we are subject to significant risks relating to changes in commodity prices and may not be able to effectively protect against these risks 

we are exposed to commodity price risk during periods where we hold title to scrap metal products that we may hold in inventory for processing or resale prices of commodities including scrap can be volatile due to numerous factors beyond our control in an increasing price environment for raw materials competitive conditions may limit our ability to pass on price increases to our consumers in a decreasing price environment for processed scrap we may not have the ability to fully recoup the cost of raw materials that we procure process and sell to our customers in addition new entrants into the market areas we serve could result in higher purchase prices for raw materials and lower margins from our scrap we have not hedged positions in certain commodities such as ferrous scrap where futures markets are not well established and where we may from time to time hedge our positions in certain nonferrous scrap transactions we could incur losses thus our sales and inventory position will be vulnerable to adverse changes in commodity prices which could materially adversely impact our operating and financial performance 

the profitability of our metals recycling operations depends in part on the availability of an adequate source of supply 

we procure our scrap inventory from numerous sources these suppliers generally are not bound by longterm contracts and have no obligation to sell recyclable metal to us in periods of low industry prices suppliers may elect to hold recyclable metal to wait for higher prices or intentionally slow their metal collection activities if a substantial number of suppliers cease selling recyclable metal to us we will be unable to recycle metal at desired levels and our results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected in addition a slowdown of industrial production in the us reduces the supply of industrial grades of metal to the metal recycling industry resulting in our having less recyclable metal available to process and market 

we may face risks associated with the implementation of our growth strategy 

our growth strategy subjects us to various risks as part of our growth strategy we may expand existing facilities enter into new product or process initiatives acquire or build additional plants acquire other businesses and metals assets enter into joint ventures or form strategic alliances that we 

believe will complement our existing business these transactions will likely involve some or all of the following risks 

• the risk of entering markets in which we have little experience • the difficulty of competing for acquisitions and other growth opportunities with companies having materially greater financial resources than us • the inability to realize anticipated synergies or other benefits expected from an acquisition • the difficulty of integrating the new or acquired operations and personnel into our existing operations • the potential disruption of ongoing operations • the diversion of financial resources to new operations or acquired businesses • the diversion of management attention from other business concerns to new operations or acquired businesses • the loss of key employees and customers of acquired businesses • the potential exposure to unknown liabilities • the inability of management to maintain uniform standards controls procedures and policies • the difficulty of managing the growth of a larger company • the risk of becoming involved in labor commercial or regulatory disputes or litigation related to the new operations or acquired businesses • the risk of becoming more highly leveraged • the risk of contractual or operational liability to other venture participants or to third parties as a result of our participation • the inability to work efficiently with joint venture or strategic alliance partners and • the difficulties of terminating joint ventures or strategic alliances these initiatives or transactions might be required for us to remain competitive but we may not be able to complete any such transactions on favorable terms or obtain financing if necessary future transactions may not improve our competitive position and business prospects as anticipated and if they do not our sales and earnings may be significantly reduced 

technology operating and startup risks as well as commodity market risks associated with our mesabi nugget ironmaking project may prevent us from realizing its anticipated benefits and could result in a loss of all or a part of our investment 

while we and certain of our current and former joint venture partners built and operated a successful small scale pilot plant on the mesabi iron range in minnesota for the production of a cost effective iron nugget using kobe steels proprietary itmk3® ironmaking process we have experienced numerous technology operational production quality control market and commodity cost risks associated with the startup and operation of the worlds first full scale commercial nugget plant mesabi nugget utilizing this technology while we have recently achieved consistent production results and a sustainable cost structure and while we continue to work to improve there can be no assurance at this time that our original expectations that this ironmaking project might be capable of maintaining that consistency of producing highquality iron nuggets for use as a scrap substitute feed stock in our steelmaking operations and in sufficient quantities and at a cost that will compare favorably with the cost of ferrous scrap and other more conventional scrap substitute products including pig iron will be 

achieved during the extended startup and operation of the project we have continued to experience various systems or process difficulties output quantity and quality limitations and raw material consumption rate and cost issues as a result we have encountered losses though diminishing in amount and the expected cost benefits from the development of this iron nugget product have diminished and in the fourth quarter of 2014 we took a pretax noncash fixed asset impairment charge of 260 million 213 million adjusted to reflect our joint venture ownership percentage in addition we have encountered and could continue to encounter additional commodity market risk if the cost to manufacture the nuggets continues to be greater than projected or if the relative market price of scrap and other scrap substitutes particularly pig iron for which this iron nugget product is intended as a lower cost substitute continues to be lower than projected which could render our nuggets noneconomical moreover we are undertaking certain ancillary ventures related to the ironmaking process such as our nearby mesabi mining facility for which we have been and are continuing to seek operating permits to allow us to mine low cost taconite ore for use in the production of nuggets mining is a business in which we have no previous experience and which is also subject to possible permitting and environmental risks and uncertainties 

we are subject to litigation which could adversely affect our profitability 

we are involved in various routine litigation matters including administrative proceedings regulatory proceedings governmental investigations environmental matters and commercial and construction contract disputes we are currently involved along with other steel manufacturing companies in several class action antitrust complaints filed in federal court in chicago illinois which allege a conspiracy to fix raise maintain and stabilize the price at which steel products were sold in the united states during a period between 2005 and 2007 by artificially restricting the supply of such steel products one of the complaints was brought on behalf of a purported class consisting of all direct purchasers of steel products a second complaint was brought on behalf of a purported class consisting of all indirect purchasers of steel products within the same time period an additional complaint was brought in december of 2010 on behalf of indirect purchasers of steel products in tennessee and has been consolidated with the original complaints all complaints seek treble damages and costs including reasonable attorney fees pre and postjudgment interest and injunctive relief plaintiffs filed a motion for class certification in may 2012 and on february 28 2013 defendants filed their joint memorandum in opposition to plaintiffs motion for class certification a hearing on class certification was held on march 5 and 6 and on april 11 2014 and the matter remains under advisement a number of other original defendants have reached settlements with plaintiffs in the direct case due to the uncertain nature of litigation we cannot presently determine the ultimate outcome of this litigation 

although not presently necessary or appropriate to make a dollar estimate of exposure to loss if any in connection with the above matter we may in the future determine that a loss accrual is necessary although we may make loss accruals if and as warranted any amounts that we may accrue from time to time could vary significantly from the amounts we actually pay due to inherent uncertainties and the inherent shortcomings of the estimation process the uncertainties involved in litigation and other factors additionally an adverse result could have a material effect on our financial condition results of operations and liquidity 

unexpected equipment downtime or shutdowns could adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and prospects 

interruptions in our production capabilities could adversely affect our production costs products available for sale and earnings during the affected period in addition to equipment failures our facilities are also subject to the risk of catastrophic loss due to unanticipated events such as fires explosions or violent weather conditions our manufacturing processes are dependent upon critical 

pieces of steelmaking equipment such as our furnaces continuous casters and rolling equipment as well as electrical equipment such as transformers this equipment may on occasion be out of service as a result of unanticipated failures or other events we have experienced and may in the future experience plant shutdowns or periods of reduced production as a result of such equipment failures or other events these disruptions could have an adverse effect on our operations customer service levels financial results and prospects 

we may face risks to the security of our information technology 

increased global information technology security requirements vulnerabilities threats and a rise in sophisticated and targeted cyber crime pose a risk to the security of our systems our information networks and to the confidentiality availability and integrity of our data as well as to the functionality of our automated and electronically controlled manufacturing operating systems although we have adopted procedures and controls to protect our information and operating technology including sensitive proprietary information and confidential and personal data there can be no assurance that a system or network failure or security breach will be prevented this could lead to system interruption production delays or downtimes and operational disruptions the disclosure modification or destruction of proprietary and other key information  which could have an adverse effect on our reputation financial results and results of operations 

governmental agencies may refuse to grant or renew some of our licenses and permits 

we must receive licenses air water and other permits and approvals from state and local governments to conduct certain of our operations such as our minnesota ironmaking operations or to develop or acquire new facilities governmental agencies sometimes resist the establishment of certain types of facilities in their communities including scrap metal collection and processing facilities both mesabi nugget and mesabi mining have had difficulties securing or renewing all of their necessary permits and there can be no assurance that future approvals licenses and permits will be granted or that we will be able to maintain and renew the approvals licenses and permits we currently hold failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition

 item 3 legal proceedings 

we are involved in various routine litigation matters including administrative proceedings regulatory proceedings governmental investigations environmental matters and commercial and construction contract disputes none of which are expected to have a material impact on our financial condition results of operations or liquidity 

we are involved along with other steel manufacturing companies in several class action antitrust complaints filed in federal court in chicago illinois which allege a conspiracy to fix raise maintain and stabilize the price at which steel products were sold in the united states during a period between 2005 and 2007 by artificially restricting the supply of such steel products one of the complaints were brought on behalf of a purported class consisting of all direct purchasers of steel products a second complaint was brought on behalf of a purported class consisting of all indirect purchasers of steel products within the same time period an additional complaint was brought in december 2010 on behalf of indirect purchasers of steel products in tennessee and has been consolidated with the original complaints all complaints seek treble damages and costs including reasonable attorney fees pre and postjudgment interest and injunctive relief plaintiffs filed a motion for class certification in may 2012 and on february 28 2013 defendants filed their joint memorandum in opposition to plaintiffs motion for class certification a hearing on class certification was held on march 57 and april 11 2014 and the matter remains under advisement its unclear when the court will issue its ruling 

due to the uncertain nature of litigation we cannot presently determine the ultimate outcome of this litigation however we have determined based on the information available at this time that there is not presently a reasonable possibility as that term is defined in asc 4502020 that the outcome of these legal proceedings would have a material impact on our financial condition results of operations or liquidity although not presently necessary or appropriate to make a dollar estimate of exposure to loss if any in connection with the above matter we may in the future determine that a loss accrual is necessary although we may make loss accruals if and as warranted any amounts that we may accrue from time to time could vary significantly from the amounts we actually pay due to inherent uncertainties and the inherent shortcomings of the estimation process the uncertainties involved in litigation and other factors additionally an adverse result could have a material effect on our financial condition results of operations and liquidity

operating statement classifications 

net sales net sales from our operations are a factor of volumes shipped product mix and related pricing we charge premium prices for certain grades of steel product dimensions certain smaller volumes and for valueadded processing or coating of the steel products except for our steel fabrication operations segment we recognize revenue from sales and the allowance for estimated costs associated with returns from these sales at the time the title of the product is transferred to the customer provision is made for estimated product returns and customer claims based on estimates and actual historical experience net sales from steel fabrication operations are recognized from construction contracts utilizing a percentageofcompletion methodology based on steel tons used on completed units to date as a percentage of estimated total steel tons required for each contract 

costs of goods sold our costs of goods sold represent all direct and indirect costs associated with the manufacture of our products the principal elements of these costs are scrap and scrap substitutes which represent the most significant single component of our consolidated costs of goods sold steel direct and indirect labor and related benefits alloys zinc transportation and freight repairs and maintenance utilities most notably electricity and natural gas and depreciation 

selling general and administrative expenses selling general and administrative expenses consist of all costs associated with our sales finance and accounting and administrative departments these costs include among other items labor and related benefits professional services insurance premiums property taxes companywide profit sharing and amortization of intangible and other assets 

interest expense net of capitalized interest interest expense consists of interest associated with our senior credit facilities and other debt net of interest costs that are required to be capitalized during the construction period of certain capital investment projects 

other expense income net other income consists of interest income earned on our temporary cash deposits and investments any other nonoperating income activity including income from nonconsolidated investments accounted for under the equity method other expense consists of any nonoperating costs such as acquisition and certain financing expenses 

2014 overview 

we are one of the largest steel producers and one of the largest metals recyclers in the united states based on a current estimated annual steelmaking and coating capability of approximately 11 million tons and actual recycling volumes the primary sources of our revenues are from the manufacture and sale of steel products processing and sale of recycled ferrous and nonferrous metals and to a lesser degree fabrication and sale of steel joist and decking products our operations are managed and reported based on three operating segments steel operations metals recycling and ferrous resources operations and steel fabrication operations 

acquisition of severstal columbus llc columbus 

on september 16 2014 we completed our acquisition of severstal columbus llc columbus on a debtfree basis for a purchase price of 1625 billion with additional working capital adjustments of 444 million the columbus acquisition was funded through the issuance of 12 billion of senior notes borrowings under our senior secured credit facility and available cash we purchased columbus to significantly expand and diversify our steel operating base with the addition of 34 million tons of hot roll steel production capacity the product offerings are diversified with respect to width gauge and strength when compared to the capabilities of our butler flat roll division located in northeast mississippi columbus is one of the newest and most technologically advanced sheet steel electric arc furnace mills in north america with access to nonenergy related pipe and tube oil country tubular goods octg and automotive markets additionally columbus is advantageously located to serve the growing markets in the southern us and mexico providing geographic diversification and growth opportunities columbus operating results have been reflected in our financial statements since the effective date of the acquisition in the steel operations reporting segment columbus reported revenues of 6383 million and pretax income of 561 million during the september 16 to december 31 2014 period before giving effect to 264 million of purchase accounting related cost of goods sold expenses associated with the stepup in inventory fixed assets and intangible assets and 252 million of acquisition and related costs that are included in other expenses in the consolidated income statement for the year ended december 31 2014 

minnesota ironmaking operations impairment 

during the fourth quarter of 2014 our minnesota ironmaking operations reached a steady operating state indicating a consistency in the operations production capability processes and cost structure including the ability to utilize certain lowercost raw materials given this we undertook an assessment of the recoverability of the carrying value of our minnesota ironmaking operations fixed assets with our current outlook regarding future operating costs and product pricing we 

concluded that the carrying value of these fixed assets was no longer fully recoverable and the fixed assets were in fact impaired this assessment resulted in a 2600 million noncash impairment charge including amounts attributable to noncontrolling interests of 465 million recorded in the metals recycling and ferrous resources operating segment which reduced net income attributable to steel dynamics inc by 1326 million and our diluted earnings per share by 055 

consolidated results 2014 vs 2013 

net sales in 2014 of 88 billion increased 19 from 2013 net sales of 74 billion due to increased shipments in all of our operating segments and higher average selling prices in our steel and fabrication operations we achieved record volumes in our steel and fabrication segments which reported increased shipments of 19 4 without columbus and 31 respectively in 2014 as compared to 2013 demand continues to be strong in the automotive and manufacturing markets the nonresidential construction markets continues to improve and we began to realize sales from our new specialbarquality smalldiameter rolling mill at our engineered bar products division and from our premium rail expansion at our structural and rail division our metal spreads in steel and fabrication also improved as market pricing increased to a greater degree than raw materials costs plant utilization was also strong which resulted in volumerelated cost compression in our steel and fabrications segments while shipments increased at omnisource our metals recycling operations operating income decreased in 2014 when compared to 2013 due to decreases in metal spreads the impact of losses from our minnesota ironmaking operations on 2014 net income including the impact of the 2600 million of noncash impairment charges was approximately 1659 million or 069 per diluted share as compared to approximately 42 million or 018 per diluted share in 2013 as a result of the above net income in 2014 including the impact of impairment charges decreased 323 million or 17 to 1570 million or 067 per diluted share 

excluding the impact of the 2600 million in noncash impairment charges consolidated operating income increased 1938 million or 50 to 5803 million in 2014 compared to 3865 million in 2013 and net income increased 1003 million or 53 to 2896 million or 122 per diluted share during 2014 compared with net income of 1893 million or 083 per diluted share during 2013 the impact of the 2600 million noncash impairment charge related to our minnesota ironmaking operations including amounts attributable to noncontrolling interests of 465 million reduced net income attributable to steel dynamics inc by 1326 million and our diluted earnings per share by 055 

steel fabrication and metals recycling shipments during the respective years are presented below including intercompany shipments 



segment operating results 2014 vs 2013  dollars in thousands  



1 other consists of the results of subsidiary operations that are below the quantitative thresholds required for reportable segments as well as unallocated corporate accounts including profit sharing operating loss in the other category includes 03 million and 82 million of noncash impairment charges in 2013 and 2012 respectively 2 metals recycling and ferrous resources 2014 operating loss of 309 million in 2014 includes 260 million of noncash impairment charges related to our minnesota ironmaking operations 



steel operations steel operations consist of our six electric arc furnace steel mills producing steel from ferrous scrap utilizing continuous casting automated rolling mills and eight downstream coating facilities collectively our steel operations sell directly to end users and service centers see item 1 to this form 10k these products are used in numerous industry sectors including the automotive construction commercial transportation agriculture industrial machinery pipe and tube and energy markets during 2014 2013 and 2012 our steel operations accounted for 63 61 and 62 respectively of our consolidated net sales 

sheet products our sheet operations consist of our butler flat roll division columbus flat roll division acquired september 16 2014 and our downstream coating facilities these operations sell a broad range of sheet steel products such as hot roll cold roll and coated steel products including a wide variety of specialty products such as light gauge hot roll and galvanized butler flat roll division sells other products such as galvalume® and painted products while columbus flat roll division sells other products such as highstrength octg pipe and nonenergy line pipe products the techs is comprised of three galvanizing lines which sell specialized galvanized sheet steels used in nonautomotive applications

steel operations shipments 



steel operations shipments and average selling price 

net sales for the steel operations segment increased in 2014 by 12 billion or 25 6383 million or 13 of which related to the addition of columbus compared to 2013 with the segment achieving record shipments of 74 million tons in 2014 selling volumes increased for both our sheet products 26 of which 24 was related to columbus and long products 12 in 2014 compared to 2013 and overall product mix shifted somewhat toward sheet products with the acquisition of our columbus flat roll division our engineered bar products and structural and rail divisions achieved increased shipments of 32 and 12 respectively demand for our sheet products remained strong in the automotive and manufacturing markets customer demand for our specialbarquality products strengthened from the prior year and we began selling smaller diameter products produced from our recent expansion project demand for structural steel products improved with the continued growth in the nonresidential construction market and we began to realize sales from our recently completed expansion into premium rail in addition despite pressure from increased imports in 2014 our average steel selling prices improved by 35 per ton or 4 over those in 2013 on the strength of improved domestic market demand in 2014 

metallic raw materials used in our steel mills electric arc furnaces represent our single most significant steel manufacturing cost our metallic raw material cost per net ton consumed in our steel operations increased 7 in 2014 compared with 2013 during 2014 2013 and 2012 respectively our metallic raw material costs represented 65 65 and 66 of our steel operations manufacturing costs excluding the operations of the techs which purchases rather than produces the steel it further processes 

as a result of record shipments and metal spread expansion which we define as the difference between average selling prices and the cost of ferrous scrap operating income for the steel segment increased 33 to 6716 million in 2014 compared to 5044 million in 2013 



metals recycling and ferrous resources operations this operating segment primarily includes our metals recycling operations omnisource our liquid pig iron production facility iron dynamics idi and our minnesota ironmaking operations our metals recycling and ferrous resources operations segment accounted for 28 32 and 32 of our consolidated net sales in 2014 2013 and 2012 respectively segment operating losses before impairment charges decreased 37 million in 2014 to 487 million compared to 2013 as reduced losses in the minnesota ironmaking operations were partially offset by reductions in metals recycling operating income 

metals recycling and ferrous resources shipments 



metals recycling omnisource represents our metals sourcing and processing operations and is the primary source of net sales in this segment these operations sell ferrous metals to steel mills and foundries and nonferrous metals such as copper brass aluminum and stainless steel to among others ingot manufacturers copper refineries and mills smelters and specialty mills our metals recycling operations represented 87 91 and 94 of this segments net sales during 2014 2013 and 2012 and 260 million 419 million and 477 million of this segments operating income for these same periods respectively 

net sales in metals recycling increased 8 in 2014 as compared to 2013 as nonferrous volumes increased 12 with steady pricing while ferrous volumes were slightly higher and selling prices increased 2 operating income for metals recycling decreased 159 million or 38 in 2014 when compared to 2013 as the decreases in both ferrous and nonferrous metal spreads of 8 and 2 respectively which we define as the difference between average selling prices and the cost of purchased scrap more than offset the impact of the increased nonferrous and to a lesser degree ferrous shipments 

ferrous resources our ferrous resource operations consist of our two ironmaking initiatives iron dynamics idi a liquid pig iron production facility and our minnesota ironmaking operations consisting of an iron nugget production facility and operations to supply the nugget facility with its primary raw material iron concentrate idi primarily produces liquid pig iron which is used as a scrap substitute raw material input exclusively at our butler flat roll division our minnesota ironmaking operations consists of mesabi nugget owned 82 by us our iron concentrate and potential future iron mining operations mesabi mining and our iron tailings operations mining resources owned 81 by us during the fourth quarter of 2014 our minnesota ironmaking operations reached a steady operating state indicating a consistency in the operations production capability processes and cost structure including the ability to utilize certain lowercost raw materials given this we undertook an assessment of the recoverability of the carrying value of our minnesota ironmaking operations fixed assets with our current outlook regarding future operating costs and product pricing we concluded that the carrying value of these fixed assets was no longer fully recoverable and the fixed assets were in 

fact impaired this assessment resulted in a 2600 million noncash impairment charge including amounts attributable to noncontrolling interests of 465 million which reduced net income attributable to steel dynamics inc by 1326 million the impact of losses from our minnesota ironmaking operations on 2014 net income including the impact of the 2600 million of noncash impairment charges was approximately 1659 million excluding the 2600 million in noncash impairment charges the impact of minnesota ironmaking operations on 2014 net income attributable to steel dynamics inc was approximately 333 million as compared to approximately 419 million in 2013 

in 2014 mining resources experienced higher costs due to reduced iron recovery rates from the tailings basins prompting the need to install enhanced recovery equipment which is taking place in the first quarter of 2015 due to this and a temporary excess supply of nugget inventory at our steel mills we have decided to warmidle our minnesota ironmaking operations for a period of 6 to 8 weeks beginning in midfebruary 2015 



steel fabrication operations steel fabrication operations consist of our six new millennium building systems plants located throughout the united states and northern mexico revenues from these plants are generated from the fabrication of trusses girders steel joists and steel decking used within the nonresidential construction industry steel fabrication operations accounted for 7 6 and 5 of our consolidated net sales during 2014 2013 and 2012 respectively 

steel fabrication operations sales volumes and average selling price 

net sales for the steel fabrication operations segment increased 1922 million or 44 in 2014 compared to 2013 as shipments increased 31 and average selling prices increased 116 per ton or 10 with increased demand our steel fabrication operations continue to realize strength in order activity and resulting shipments at levels in excess of overall improving consumer demand as we continue to leverage our national footprint to expand market share 

the purchase of various steel products is the largest single cost of production for our steel fabrication operations generally representing more than twothirds of the total cost of manufacturing for our steel fabrication operations the average cost of steel consumed increased in 2014 as compared to 2013 by 47 per ton consistent with increased pricing in the general relevant steel market 

operating income for the steel fabrication segment of 519 million in 2014 was over seven times that of 2013 due to record level shipments and metal spread expansion as well as decreased conversion costs realized from manufacturing efficiencies and from higher production volumes 

consolidated results 2014 vs 2013 

selling general and administrative expense sga selling general and administrative expenses including profit sharing and amortization of intangible assets were 3859 million during 2014 as compared to 3323 million during 2013 an increase of 536 million or 16 during 2014 and 2013 these selling general and administrative expenses represented approximately 44 and 45 of net sales respectively the increase in total sga expenses in 2014 compared to 2013 relates most notably to the increased profit sharing incentive compensation and stock compensation expenses of 355 million which increased due to increased profitability before impairment charges while total intangible assets increased slightly due to the acquisition of columbus amortization of intangible assets decreased 42 million or 13 during 2014 compared to 2013 due to the accelerated amortization methods used for intangible assets related to existing customer and scrap generator relationships 

interest expense net of capitalized interest during 2014 gross interest expense increased 74 million or 6 to 1397 million and capitalized interest decreased 21 million to 25 million as compared to 2013 the decrease in interest capitalized during these periods relates to growth or expansion projects initiated in 2013 at two of our steel mills that were completed in 2014 the increase in gross interest expense is due primarily to the addition of the 12 billion senior notes in september 2014 in conjunction with our acquisition of columbus partially offset by the conversion or payoff at maturity of 2875 million of 5125 convertible notes in june 2014 

other income expense net other expense increased 223 million to 183 million during 2014 as compared to other income of 40 million during 2013 due primarily to 252 million in acquisition and finance costs associated with the acquisition of columbus 

income taxes during 2014 our income tax expense was 732 million as compared to 993 million during 2013 and our effective income tax rate before exclusion of noncontrolling interests was 444 and 378 for 2014 and 2013 respectively the higher effective income tax rate in 2014 is due primarily to the impact of the increased noncontrolling interest losses offset somewhat by increased benefits from other permanent tax benefit items most notably the domestic manufacturing deduction the 2013 effective tax rate benefited from the effects of additional stock option exercises during 2013 and 2012 research and development tax credits enacted in january 2013 

included in the balance of unrecognized tax benefits at december 31 2014 of 173 million are potential benefits of 125 million that if recognized would affect the effective tax rate we recognize interest and penalties related to our tax contingencies on a netoftax basis in income tax expense during the year ended december 31 2014 we recognized benefits from the reduction of interest expense of 11 million net of tax in addition to the unrecognized tax benefits noted above we had 55 million accrued for the payment of interest and penalties at december 31 2014 

we file income tax returns in the us federal jurisdiction as well as income tax returns in various state jurisdictions the internal revenue service irs has completed its examinations of the years 2004 through 2009 and has settled those years with us the irs is currently examining our federal income tax returns for the years 2010 and 2011 at this time we do not believe there will be any significant examination adjustments that would result in a material change to our financial position results of operations or cash flows it is reasonably possible that the amount of unrecognized tax benefits could change in the next twelve months as a result of these state and federal income tax audits based on the current audits in process the payment of taxes as a result of audit settlements could be in an amount from zero to 81 million by the end of 2015 with the exception of the 2010 federal return which is currently under review we are no longer subject to federal state and local income tax examinations by tax authorities for years ended before 2011 

consolidated results 2013 vs 2012 

during 2013 net sales of 74 billion and operating income of 3865 million was relatively unchanged from 2012 net sales of 73 billion and operating income of 3912 million despite generally higher shipments as 2013 full year metal margins declined for our steel and metals recycling operations however 2013 consolidated pretax income increased 588 million or 29 reflecting interest cost savings of 309 million and a reduction in refinancing costs of 377 million which were associated with our 2012 and early 2013 financing activities net income attributable to steel dynamics inc was 1893 million or 083 per diluted share in 2013 compared with 1636 million or 073 per diluted share in 2012 

in spite of record annual shipments in 2013 in our steel operations compressed metal margins resulted in a modest 2 increase in steel operations operating income to 5044 million compared to 2012 average 2013 steel prices per ton shipped declined 41 amidst continued pricing pressure while average ferrous scrap consumed for production only declined 25 per ton operating income of omnisource our metals recycling operations decreased 12 to 419 million as 2013 ferrous and nonferrous metals shipments were comparable to 2012 however both ferrous and nonferrous metal margins decreased slightly during the year the impact of losses from our minnesota ironmaking operations on 2013 net income was approximately 42 million or 018 per diluted share in each of 2013 and 2012 our steel fabrication operations reported operating income of 70 million in 2013 an increase of 49 million or 231 compared to 2012 experiencing a 24 increase in selling volumes the result of improved domestic demand for fabricated steel as well as our fabrication operations gains in market share 

selling general and administrative expense sga selling general and administrative expenses including profit sharing and amortization of intangible assets were 3323 million during 2013 as compared to 3205 million during 2012 an increase of 118 million or 4 during 2013 and 2012 selling general and administrative expenses represented approximately 45 and 44 of net sales respectively the increase in sga expenses in 2013 compared to 2012 relates most notably to increased noncash equitybased compensation expenses of 53 million amortization of intangible assets decreased 38 million or 11 during 2013 compared to 2012 due to the accelerated amortization methods used for intangible assets related to customer and scrap generator relationships 

interest expense net of capitalized interest during 2013 gross interest expense decreased 277 million or 17 to 1323 million and capitalized interest increased 32 million to 46 million as compared to 2012 the interest capitalized during these periods relates to longerterm construction activities at our various operating segments which increased in 2013 with our increased expansion plans as compared to 2012 the decrease in gross interest expense is due to refinancing activities that took place in primarily the second half of 2012 and march 2013 we repaid 175 million of our debt in 2012 and 100 million in 2013 we also refinanced 14 billion of senior notes reducing our overall effective interest rate from almost 70 to less than 56 at december 31 2013 

other income expense net other income was 40 million during 2013 as compared to other expense of 285 million during 2012 we recorded nonoperating charges of 26 million in 2013 related to our 2013 refinancing activities while we recorded 403 million of nonoperating charges in 2012 related to our 2012 refinancing activities 

income taxes during 2013 our income tax expense was 993 million as compared to 618 million during 2012 our effective income tax rate before exclusion of noncontrolling interests was 378 and 303 during 2013 and 2012 respectively the lower effective income tax rate in 2012 is due primarily to the impact of reductions in our unrecognized tax positions due to tax audit settlements in 2012 which reduced our effective tax rate by 96 the 2013 effective tax rate benefitted from the effects of additional stock option exercises during 2013 and 2012 research and development tax credits enacted in january 2013 

liquidity and capital resources 

columbus acquisition in september 2014 we issued 7000 million of 5125 senior notes due 2021 and 5000 million of 5500 senior notes due 2024 together the senior notes the proceeds from the issuance of the senior notes along with cash on hand and 1178 million in borrowings under our senior secured credit facility were used to fund the september 16 2014 acquisition of columbus and related expenses 

capital resources and longterm debt our business is capital intensive and requires substantial expenditures for among other things the purchase and maintenance of equipment used in our steelmaking and finishing operations and to remain in compliance with environmental laws our shortterm and longterm liquidity needs arise primarily from capital expenditures working capital requirements and principal and interest payments related to our outstanding indebtedness we have met these liquidity requirements primarily with cash provided by operations longterm borrowings and availability under our revolver our liquidity at december 31 2014 is as follows in thousands 



our total outstanding debt increased 9166 million during 2014 to 30 billion due to the issuance of 12 billion in senior notes used to fund a portion of the columbus acquisition in june 2014 2875 million of our 5125 convertible senior notes were converted to shares of our common stock or paid with available cash at maturity as a result of these activities our total longterm debt to capitalization ratio representing our longterm debt including current maturities divided by the sum of our longterm debt redeemable noncontrolling interests and our total stockholders equity increased to 509 at december 31 2014 from 447 at december 31 2013 

in november 2014 we amended restated and expanded our senior secured revolving credit facility facility and entered into a new term loan facility we expanded our senior secured revolving credit facility from the prior 11 billion level to a renewed five year 12 billion facility and also entered into a new fiveyear 2500 million term loan facility both of which mature on november 14 2019 subject to certain conditions we also have the ability to increase the combined facility size by a minimum of 750 million the proceeds from the new term loan facility were used to refinance our existing 2269 million term loan facility and for general corporate purposes 

the facility contains financial and other covenants pertaining to our ability which may under certain circumstances be limited to make capital expenditures incur indebtedness permit liens on property enter into transactions with affiliates make restricted payments or investments enter into mergers acquisitions or consolidations conduct asset sales pay dividends or distributions and enter into other specified transactions and activities our ability to borrow funds within the terms of the revolver is dependent upon our continued compliance with the financial and other covenants 

the financial covenants under our facility state that we must maintain an interest coverage ratio of not less than 250100 our interest coverage ratio is calculated by dividing our lasttwelve trailing months ltm consolidated adjusted proforma ebitda earnings before interest taxes depreciation amortization and certain other noncash transactions as allowed in our facility by our ltm proforma gross interest expense less amortization of financing fees in addition a net debt as defined in the facility to consolidated ltm adjusted proforma ebitda net debt leverage ratio of not more than 500100 must be maintained if the net debt leverage ratio exceeds 350100 at any time our ability to make certain payments as defined in the facility which includes cash dividends to stockholders and share purchases among other things is limited at december 31 2014 our interest coverage ratio and net debt leverage ratio were 605100 and 247100 respectively we were therefore in compliance with 

these covenants at december 31 2014 and we anticipate we will continue to be in compliance during the next twelve months 

working capital cash flow from operations of 6176 million was driven mainly by net income plus noncash items such as depreciation and amortization and impairment charges during 2014 our operational working capital position representing amounts invested in trade receivables and inventories less current liabilities other than income taxes payable and debt increased 3175 million to 17 billion compared to december 31 2013 this 23 increase is attributable primarily to the acquisition of columbus and its 3541 millions of dollars of operational working capital at the date of acquisition inventories excluding inventories acquired from columbus decreased 687 million and were offset by corresponding decreases in accounts payable while accrued expenses primarily profit sharing and incentive compensation increased due to higher profitability levels in 2014 high credit quality of accounts receivable has been maintained and days sales outstanding has remained consistent at approximately 37 days with over 98 of our accounts receivable being current or less than 60 days past due 

capital investments during 2014 we invested 1118 million in property plant and equipment not including the columbus acquisition as compared to 1868 million during 2013 capital investments in 2014 were below those of 2013 as growth or expansion projects initiated in early 2013 at two of our steel mills were completed in 2014 we believe these capital investments will benefit our net sales and related cash flows as each project attains appropriate operational metrics our current estimated 2015 cash allocation plan includes the investment of between 150 million and 175 million in capital expenditures in our existing and announced operations 

cash dividends as a reflection of confidence in our current and future strength regarding our cash flow generation ability and financial position we increased our quarterly cash dividend by 5 to 0115 per share in 2014 from 0110 per share during 2013 resulting in declared cash dividends of 1086 million during 2014 compared to 974 million during 2013 we paid cash dividends of 1054 million and 948 million during 2014 and 2013 respectively our board of directors along with executive management approves the payment of dividends on a quarterly basis the determination to pay cash dividends in the future is at the discretion of our board of directors after taking into account various factors including our financial condition results of operations outstanding indebtedness current and anticipated cash needs and growth plans in addition the terms of our senior secured credit facility and the indenture relating to our senior notes may restrict the amount of cash dividends we can pay 

other our ability to meet our debt service obligations and reduce our total debt will depend upon our future performance which in turn will depend upon general economic financial and business conditions along with competition legislation and regulatory factors that are largely beyond our control in addition we cannot assure that our operating results cash flows access to credit markets and capital resources will be sufficient for repayment of our indebtedness in the future we believe that based upon current levels of operations and anticipated growth cash flows from operations together with other available sources of funds including additional borrowings under our revolver through its term which expires in november 2019 will be adequate for the next twelve months for making required payments of principal and interest on our indebtedness funding working capital requirements and anticipated capital expenditures 

during 2014 we received benefits from state and local governments in the form of real estate and personal property tax abatements and credits of approximately 88 million based on our current abatements and incentive credits and utilizing our existing longlived asset structure we estimate the remaining annual benefit to our future operations to be approximately 220 million 200 million 218 million 130 million and 12 million during the years 2015 through 2019 respectively and 207000 in total thereafter 

contractual obligations and other longterm liabilities 

we have the following minimum commitments under contractual obligations including purchase obligations as defined by the securities and exchange commission a purchase obligation is defined as an agreement to purchase goods or services that is enforceable and legally binding and that specifies all significant terms including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased fixed minimum or variable price provisions and the approximate timing of the transaction other longterm liabilities are defined as longterm liabilities that are reflected on our balance sheet under generally accepted accounting principles based on this definition the following table includes only those contracts which include fixed or minimum obligations it does not include normal purchases which are made in the ordinary course of business the following table provides aggregated information about outstanding contractual obligations and other longterm liabilities as of december 31 2014 in thousands 



1 the longterm debt payment information presented above assumes that our term loan and senior notes remain outstanding until maturity refer to note 3 to the consolidated financial statements elsewhere in this report for additional information regarding these transactions and our longterm debt 2 the estimated interest payments shown above assume interest rates of 178 variable rate at december 31 2014 on the 2500 million term loan issued november 2014 maturing in november 2019 6 1  8  on our 4000 million senior unsecured notes due august 2019 7 5  8  on our 3500 million senior unsecured notes due march 2020 5125 on our 7000 million senior unsecured notes due october 2021 6 3  8  on our 3500 million senior unsecured notes due august 2022 5 1  4  on our 4000 million senior unsecured notes due march 2023 5500 on our 5000 million senior unsecured notes due october 2024 0275 commitment fee on our available senior secured revolver and an average of 49 on our other debt of 742 million 3 purchase obligations include commitments we have for the purchase of electricity natural gas and its transportation fuel air products and zinc these arrangements have take or pay or other similar commitment provisions we have utilized such take or pay requirements during the past three years under these contracts 4 construction commitments relate to firm contracts we have with various vendors for the completion of certain construction projects at our various divisions at december 31 2014 5 other commitments principally relate to certain pension and deferred compensation plan obligations 

6 we expect to make cash outlays in the future related to our unrecognized tax benefits however due to the uncertainty of the timing we are unable to make reasonably reliable estimates regarding the period of cash settlement with the respective taxing authorities accordingly unrecognized tax benefits and related interest and penalties of 228 million as of december 31 2014 have been excluded from the contractual obligations table above refer to note 4 to the consolidated financial statements elsewhere in this report for additional information 

other matters 

inflation 

we believe that inflation has not had a material effect on our results of operations 

environmental and other contingencies 

we have incurred and in the future will continue to incur capital expenditures and operating expenses for matters relating to environmental control remediation monitoring and compliance during 2014 we incurred costs related to the monitoring and compliance of environmental matters in the amount of approximately 403 million and capital expenditures related to environmental compliance of approximately 40 million over 78 of the costs incurred during 2014 for monitoring and compliance were related to the normal transportation of certain types of waste produced in the steelmaking process in accordance with legal requirements we incurred combined environmental remediation costs of approximately 11 million at all of our facilities during 2014 we have an accrual of 16 million net of 600000 of escrowed funds recorded for environmental remediation related to our metals recycling operations and 28 million related to minnesota operations we believe apart from our dependence on environmental construction and operating permits for our existing and any future manufacturing facilities that compliance with current environmental laws and regulations is not likely to have a materially adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or liquidity however environmental laws and regulations evolve and change and we may become subject to more stringent environmental laws and regulations in the future such as the impact of us government or various governmental agencies introducing regulatory changes in response to the potential of climate change 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

managements discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the u s we review the accounting policies we use in reporting our financial results on a regular basis the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent liabilities we evaluate the appropriateness of these estimations and judgments on an ongoing basis we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources results may differ from these estimates due to actual outcomes being different from those on which we based our assumptions we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 

revenue recognition and allowance for doubtful accounts except for our steel fabrication operations segment we recognize revenues from sales and the allowance for estimated returns from these sales when the title of the product transfers provision is made for estimated product returns and customer claims based on historical experience if the historical data used in our estimates does not 

reflect future returns and claims trends additional provision may be necessary the allowance for doubtful accounts is based on the companys best estimate of probably credit losses along with historical experience which estimates may or may not prove accurate our steel fabrication operations segment recognizes revenues from construction contracts using a percentage of completion methodology based on steel tons used on completed units todate as a percentage of estimated total steel tons required by each contract 

we are exposed to credit risk in the event of nonpayment by our customers which in steel operations are principally intermediate steel processors and service centers that sell our products to numerous industry sectors including the automotive construction commercial transportation agriculture industrial machinery pipe and tube and energy including octg markets our metals recycling operations sell ferrous scrap to steel mills and foundries and nonferrous scrap such as copper brass aluminum and stainless steel to among others ingot manufacturers copper refineries and mills smelters and specialty mills our fabrication operations sell fabricated steel joists and deck primarily to the nonresidential construction market we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments based on known credit risks historical loss experience and current economic conditions affecting our customers we mitigate our exposure to credit risk by performing ongoing credit evaluations and taking further action when necessary such as requiring letters of credit or other security interests to support the receivable from our customer if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate resulting in the impairment of their ability to make payments additional allowance may be required 

inventories we record inventories at lower of cost or market cost is determined using a weighted average cost method for scrap and on a firstin firstout basis for other inventory we record amounts required if any to reduce the carrying value of inventory to its net realizable value as a charge to cost of goods sold if product selling prices were to decline in future periods writedown of inventory could result specifically raw material inventory such as scrap purchased during periods of peak market pricing 

impairments of longlived tangible and finitelived intangible assets we review longlived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of such assets may not be fully recoverable impairment losses are recorded on longlived assets used in operations when indicators of impairment are present and the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than the assets carrying amounts the impairment loss is measured by comparing the fair value of the asset to its carrying amount we consider various factors and determine whether an impairment test is necessary including by way of examples a significant and prolonged deterioration in operating results andor projected cash flows significant changes in the extent or manner in which an asset is used technological advances with respect to assets which would potentially render them obsolete our strategy and capital planning and the economic climate in markets to be served when determining future cash flows and if necessary fair value we must make judgments as to the expected utilization of assets and estimated future cash flows related to those assets we consider historical and anticipated future results general economic and market conditions the impact of planned business and operational strategies and all other available information at the time the estimates are made those estimates and judgments may or may not ultimately prove accurate 

during the fourth quarter of 2014 our minnesota ironmaking operations reached a steady state indicating a consistency in the operations production capability processes and cost structure including the ability to utilize certain lowercost raw materials given this we undertook an assessment of the recoverability of the carrying value of our minnesota ironmaking operations fixed assets with our current outlook regarding future operating costs and product pricing we concluded that the carrying value of these fixed assets was no longer fully recoverable and the fixed assets were in fact impaired this assessment resulted in a 2600 million impairment charge including amounts attributable to noncontrolling interests of 465 million recorded in the metals recycling and ferrous resources 

operating segment the carrying values of the impaired assets were adjusted to their expected fair values as determined primarily on the cost approach as well as expected future discounted cash flows income approach using level 3 inputs under asc 820 

in the third quarter of 2012 we terminated two small joint venture entities which were not aligned with our longterm strategic focus the decision to terminate these joint ventures triggered an assessment for impairment based on estimated realizable values resulting in an impairment charge of 83 million being recorded as these joint ventures are not reported within any of our reportable segments reported segment results were not affected 

goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets 

our goodwill relates to various business combinations and is allocated to the following reporting units at december 31in thousands 



at least once annually or when indicators of impairment exist we perform an impairment test for goodwill goodwill is allocated to various reporting units which are generally one level below our operating segments we utilize a twostepped approach to measuring goodwill impairment the first step of the test determines if there is potential goodwill impairment in this step we compare the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying amount which includes goodwill the fair value of the reporting unit is determined by using an estimate of future cash flows utilizing a riskadjusted discount rate to calculate the net present value of future cash flows income approach and by using a market approach based upon an analysis of valuation metrics of comparable peer companies if the carrying amount exceeds the fair value we perform the second step of the test which measures the amount of impairment loss to be recorded if any in the second step we compare the carrying amount of the goodwill to the implied fair value of the goodwill based on the net fair value of the recognized and unrecognized assets and liabilities of the reporting unit if the implied fair value is less than the carrying value an impairment loss is recorded to the extent that the fair value of the goodwill is less than its carrying value 

key assumptions used to determine the estimated fair value of each reporting unit under the discounted cash flows method income approach include a expected cash flows for the fiveyear period following the testing date including market share sales volumes and prices costs to produce and estimated capital needs b an estimated terminal value using a terminal year growth rate determined based on the growth prospects of the reporting unit and c a riskadjusted discount rate based on managements best estimate of market participants aftertax weighted average cost of capital and market risk premiums key assumptions used to determine the estimated fair value of each reporting unit under the market approach include the expected revenues and cash flows in the next year we consider historical and anticipated future results general economic and market conditions the impact of planned business and operational strategies and all available information at the time the fair 

values of its reporting units are estimated those estimates and judgments may or may not ultimately prove accurate 

goodwill and other intangible assets acquired in past transactions are naturally more susceptible to impairment primarily due to the fact that they are recorded at fair value based on operating plans and economic conditions at the time of acquisition consequently if operating results andor economic conditions deteriorate after an acquisition it could result in the impairment of the acquired assets a deterioration of economic conditions may not only negatively impact the estimated operating cash flows used in our cash flow models but may also negatively impact other assumptions used in our analyses including but not limited to the estimated cost of capital andor discount rates additionally we are required to ensure that assumptions used to determine fair value in our analyses are consistent with the assumptions a hypothetical marketplace participant would use as a result the cost of capital andor discount rates used in our analyses may increase or decrease based on market conditions and trends regardless of whether our actual cost of capital has changed therefore we may recognize an impairment of an intangible asset or assets in spite of realizing actual cash flows that are approximately equal to or greater than our previously forecasted amounts 

our other indefinitelived intangible assets relate to trademarks acquired through various business combinations and is allocated to the following reporting units at december 31 2014 and 2013 in thousands 



at least annually or when indicators of impairment exist we perform an impairment test for indefinitelived intangible assets through the comparison of the fair value of the specific intangible asset with its carrying amount the fair value of the intangible asset is determined by using an estimate of future cash flows attributable to the asset and a riskadjusted discount rate to compute a net present value of future cash flows if the fair value is less than the carrying value an impairment loss is recorded in an amount equal to the excess in carrying value 

our fourth quarter 2014 annual goodwill and indefinitelived intangible asset impairment analyses did not result in any impairment charges management does not believe that it is reasonably likely that our reporting units will fail step one of a goodwill impairment test in the near term the most significant portion of our goodwill relates to the omnisource reporting unit the fair value of omnisource exceeded its carrying value by approximately 10 however our analysis contemplates growth in overall scrap consumption and thus our sales volumes and metal margins based on economic and industry forecasts and some planned organic growth and cost containment activities while management believes these assumptions are reasonable and their use appropriate actual results may not meet forecasted results an 11 decrease in forecasted cash flows would not result in a failure of step 1 for the omnisource reporting unit the riskadjusted discount rate used in the analysis is also a critical assumption one in which a minor change can have a significant impact on the estimated fair value a more than 95 basis point increase in the 120 riskadjusted discount rate used in the omnisource analysis holding other assumptions constant would not result in a failure of step 1 for the reporting unit we will continue to monitor operating results within all reporting units throughout the upcoming year in an effort to determine if events and circumstances warrant interim impairment testing otherwise all reporting units will again be subject to the required annual impairment test during the fourth quarter of 2015 changes in judgments and estimates underlying our analysis of goodwill for possible impairment including expected future operating cash flows and discount rate could decrease the estimated fair value of our reporting units in the future and could result in an impairment of goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets 

income taxes we are required to estimate our income taxes as a part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements this requires us to estimate our actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatments of items for tax and accounting purposes these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities which are included within our consolidated balance sheet we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely we must establish a valuation allowance we establish reserves to reduce some or all of the tax benefit of any of our tax positions at the time we determine that the positions become uncertain we adjust these reserves including any impact on the related interest and penalties in light of changing facts and circumstances such as the progress of a tax audit a number of years may elapse before a particular matter for which we have established a reserve is audited by a taxing authority and finally resolved the number of years with open tax audits varies depending on the tax jurisdiction the tax benefit that has been previously reserved because of a failure to meet the more likely than not recognition threshold would be recognized in our income tax expense in the first interim period when the uncertainty disappears settlement of any particular issue would usually require the use of cash 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

market risk 

in the normal course of business we are exposed to interest rate changes our objectives in managing exposure to interest rate changes are to limit the impact of these rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower overall borrowing costs to achieve these objectives we primarily use interest rate swaps to manage net exposure to interest rate changes related to our portfolio of borrowings 

the following table represents the principal cash repayments and related weightedaverage interest rates by maturity date for our longterm debt as of december 31 2014 in thousands 



commodity risk 

in the normal course of business we are exposed to the market risk and price fluctuations related to the sale of our products and to the purchase of raw materials used in our operations such as metallic raw materials electricity natural gas and its transportation services fuel air products and zinc our risk strategy associated with product sales has generally been to obtain competitive prices for our products and to allow operating results to reflect market price movements dictated by supply and demand 

our risk strategy associated with the purchase of raw materials utilized within our operations has generally been to make some commitments with suppliers relating to future expected requirements for some commodities such as electricity natural gas and its transportation services fuel air products and zinc certain of these commitments contain provisions which require us to take or pay for specified quantities without regard to actual usage for periods of up to 30 months for physical commodity requirements for up to 5 years for commodity transportation requirements and for up to 13 years for air products our commitments for these arrangements with take or pay or other similar commitment provisions for the years ending december 31 are as follows in thousands 



we utilized such take or pay requirements during the past three years under these contracts we believe that production requirements will be such that consumption of the products or services purchased under these commitments will occur in the normal production process we also purchase electricity consumed at our flat roll division pursuant to a contract which extends through december 2015 the contract designates 160 hours annually as interruptible service and establishes an agreed fixedrate energy charge per millkwh consumed for each year through the expiration of the agreement 

in our metals recycling operations we have certain fixed price contracts with various customers and suppliers for future delivery of nonferrous metals our risk strategy has been to enter into base metal financial contracts with the goal to protect the profit margin within certain parameters that was contemplated when we entered into the transaction with the customer or vendor at december 31 2014 we had a cumulative unrealized loss associated with these financial contracts of 38 million substantially all of which have a settlement date in 2015 we believe the customer contracts associated with the financial contracts will be fully consummated

we maintain a secure supply of ferrous raw material resources through the benefit of our metals recycling operations as well as through our current ironmaking facilities ferrous materials represent our singlelargest raw material component of our steel operations total manufacturing costs excluding the techs representing 65 and 66 of such costs in 2013 and 2012 respectively during 2013 and 2012 our metals recycling operations provided our steel operations with 45 and 51 respectively of its ferrous scrap requirements based on volume during both 2013 and 2012 we consumed 63 and 60 million tons of metallic materials in our steel making furnaces of which iron units other than scrap represented approximately 8 in both years our ironmaking operations internally supplied 95 and 90 of these iron units in 2013 and 2012 respectively through the transfer of liquid pig iron hot briquetted iron and iron nuggets which are higherquality energysaving ferrous raw materials 

we expect domestic and global demand for steel products to continue to increase and we believe there may be supply constraints of various commodities including ferrous materials during periods of economic downturn significant reductions in available prime industrial scrap are a direct result of lower domestic manufacturing rates additionally as consumers utilize assets for longer periods of time and replace items less frequently the flow of other sources of scrap such as auto bodies appliances and other goods is also constrained the world demand for domestic ferrous resources has increased in nearly every year in the past decade impacting scrap availability as exports increase to developing countries 

we believe our metals recycling and ferrous resources operations not only provide us with a quality cost effective and secure raw material platform but we also believe it provides us with significant potential revenue generating and profitability opportunities that allow for funding of future growth whether in ferrous resources or in other ventures we intend to continue to participate in the development of new technologies to increase the effectiveness of our metals recycling recovery capabilities

industry segments 

we have three reporting segments steel operations metals recycling and ferrous resources operations and steel fabrication operations please refer to item 8  consolidated financial statements and supplementary data for additional information 



our steel operations segment consists of steelmaking and coating operations the following chart summarizes the locations and the current capacities of our facilities 



  



1 rolling capacity expected to increase to 950000 tons in the first half of 2014 from an expansion project currently in process 2 galvanizing capacity expected to increase to 370000 tons in the second half of 2014 due to equipment enhancements currently in process 

note capacities represent manufacturing capabilities based on mill configuration and related employee support these capacities do not represent expected volumes in a given year in addition estimates of mill capacity particularly rolling capacity are highly dependent on the specific product mix manufactured each of our mills can and do roll many different types and sizes of products therefore our capacity estimates assume a typical product mix 

sheet products 

our sheet steel products are produced by both our flat roll division which consists of our flat roll mill galvanizing and painting facilities in butler indiana our galvanizing and painting facilities in jeffersonville indiana and the techs our pittsburgh pennsylvaniabased galvanizing company which operates three galvanizing facilities galvtech metaltech and nextech 

our flat roll division manufactures flat hot rolled cold rolled and coated steel products we produced 30 million tons and 28 million tons at this division in 2013 and 2012 respectively our products are characterized by high quality surface characteristics precise tolerances and light gauge in addition this division has achieved iso 90012008—ansiisoasq q90012008 certification we believe that these certifications have enabled us to serve a broad range of customers who may require certifications for themselves or to satisfy the endusers of our steel products 

our flat roll mill has two twinshell electric arc furnaces which enable us to melt scrap in one vessel while tapping the other vessel and refilling it with steel scrap and iron units to make it ready for the next heat this results in more heats and greater productivity we have three ladle metallurgy 

stations two continuous thinslab casters and two tunnel furnaces our hot rolling mill which progressively reduces the slab in thickness consists of a sevenstand rolling mill capable of rolling sheet steel down to 10 mm with excellent surface quality which enables us to access markets typically available only to more expensive cold finished material 

located within our flat roll mill we have a hot rolled galvanizing line capable of coating steel in gauges from 044 to 160 inches and in widths ranging from 40 to 61 inches also within our flat roll mill we have a cold rolled galvanizing line capable of coating steel in gauges from 012 to 070 inches and in widths ranging from 40 to 61 inches our onsite paint line receives material directly from our other processing lines and is capable of painting hot rolled galvanized coil cold rolled coil and cold rolled galvanized coil in gauges of 012 to 070 inches and in widths ranging from 40 to 61 inches we believe this enables us to realize substantial savings in the production of painted coil and pass along savings and efficiencies to our customers when compared to remote offsite coating facilities 

in jeffersonville indiana we have a cold rolled galvanizing facility located within the clark maritime centre on the ohio river this facility is capable of coating cold rolled steel in gauges from 012 to 040 inches and in widths between 40 and 61 inches this gauge range is lighter than that available from our butler facility and creates further expansion of our value added product offerings our flat roll mill provides our jeffersonville facility with cold rolled material 

the techs facilities produced 671000 tons and 657000 tons in 2013 and 2012 respectively the techs facilities have galvanizing lines with varying capabilities nextech is capable of coating cold rolled steel in gauges from 007 to 020 inches and in widths between 24 and 43 inches galvtech is capable of coating cold rolled steel in gauges from 012 to 040 inches and in widths between 30 and 60 inches metaltech is capable of coating cold rolled steel in gauges from 015 to 160 inches and in widths between 24 and 52 inches in addition to third party steel producers our flat roll division provides the techs with required steel material the techs has achieved the iso 90012008—ansiisoasq q90012008 certification 

the following chart summarizes the types of sheet products we sold during 2013 2012 and 2011 

sheet product mix 

hot rolled products our flat roll mill produces hot rolled products that include a variety of high quality low and medium carbon and highstrength lowalloy hot rolled bands in widths from 40 to 62 inches and in thicknesses from 375 inches down to 042 inches we also produce an array of lighter gauge hot rolled products including high strength low alloy and medium carbon steels these products are suitable for automobile suspension arms frames wheels and other unexposed parts in auto and 

truck bodies truck trailer and recreational vehicle parts and components mechanical and structural steel tubing gas and fluid transmission piping building and construction products rail cars ships barges and other marine equipment agricultural equipment and farm implements lawn garden and recreation equipment industrial machinery and shipping containers and highway guard rails we believe that our basic hot rolled material has characteristics that exceed those of other flat roll steel mills and often serves as an effective substitute for more expensive cold rolled steel additionally in 2013 we installed a valueadded processing line to further enhance the shape and dimensional tolerances of our hot rolled coils 

we sell a portion of our hot rolled coils produced at our flat roll mill directly to endusers or more often to intermediate steel processors and service centers where they may be pickled cold rolled annealed tempered galvanized or painted by those customers the rest of the hot rolled coils are directed to our cold mill where we add value to this product through our own pickling cold rolling annealing tempering galvanizing and painting processes a portion of our cold rolled production is shipped to our jeffersonville indiana galvanizing facility 

cold rolled products cold rolled steel is hot rolled steel that has been further processed through a pickler and then passed through a rolling mill until the desired gauge or thickness and other physical properties have been achieved cold rolling reduces gauge and hardens the steel and when further processed through an annealing furnace and a temper mill improves uniformity ductility and formability cold rolling can also impart various surface finishes and textures cold rolled steel is used in exposed steel applications that demand higher surface quality or finish such as exposed automobile and appliance panels cold rolled material is often coated or painted as a result of higher processing costs cold rolled prices are typically higher than hot rolled prices 

coated products hot rolled or cold rolled steel can be coated with zinc to render it corrosionresistant and to improve its paintability galvanized galvannealed galvalume® electrogalvanized and aluminized products are types of coated steels these are also the highest valueadded sheet products because they require the greatest degree of processing and tend to have the strictest quality requirements coated steel is used in high volume applications such as automobiles household appliances roofing and siding heating and air conditioning equipment air ducts switch boxes chimney flues awnings garbage cans and food containers our paint lines in butler and jeffersonville incorporate stateoftheart coil coating equipment with quick color change capability and online color matching which allows us to produce prepainted steel products that are used in many of these same end products 

we also produce hot rolled pickled and oiled hot rolled galvanized hot rolled galvannealed cold rolled galvanized cold rolled galvannealed and fully processed cold rolled sheet as a result of our lighter gauge hot rolling capabilities our hot rolled galvanized and galvannealed steel products are capable of replacing products that have traditionally only been available as more expensive cold rolled galvanized or cold rolled galvannealed steel this material is typically used in transportation products building products such as raised garage door panels heating and cooling products appliances furniture and lighting equipment 

customers steel processors and service centers typically act as intermediaries between primary steel producers and the many enduser manufacturers that require further processing of hot rolled coils the additional processing performed by the intermediate steel processors and service centers include pickling galvanizing cutting to length slitting to size leveling blanking shape correcting edge rolling shearing and stamping we believe that our intermediate steel processor and service center customers will remain an integral part of our customer base the location of our jeffersonville facility on the ohio river also creates opportunities for market expansion into other geographic regions the techs produces galvanized flat rolled products that are similar to those produced by our flat roll division and sold to a similar customer base each of the techs facilities specializes in the galvanizing of 

specific types of flat rolled steels in generally nonautomotive applications servicing a variety of customers in the heating ventilation and air conditioning hvac construction agriculture and consumer goods markets we exported 1 and 2 of our sheet products in 2013 and 2012 respectively 

during 2013 we sold our flat rolled products to over 450 customers heidtman steel products inc which is principally owned by one of our directors accounted for approximately 3 of our consolidated net sales in both 2013 and 2012 respectively

our metals recycling operations processed andor brokered approximately 55 million gross tons and 56 million gross tons of ferrous material during 2013 and 2012 respectively omnisource also processed and brokered approximately 11 billion pounds of nonferrous material during 2013 and 2012 omnisources revenues by major scrap category were 62 ferrous and 38 nonferrous including stainless in 2013 as compared to 64 ferrous and 36 nonferrous in 2012 during 2013 and 2012 approximately 9 and 10 respectively of omnisources revenues were from export sales primarily from nonferrous materials 

we sell various grades of ferrous scrap metals to steel mills and foundries in addition we sell various grades of nonferrous metals such as copper brass aluminum and stainless steel to aluminum sheet and ingot manufacturers brass and bronze ingot makers copper refineries and mills smelters specialty mills alloy manufacturers and other consumers ferrous scrap metal is the primary raw material for electric arc furnaces such as those operated by our steel mills we purchase ferrous and nonferrous scrap metals processed and unprocessed in a variety of forms for our metals recycling facilities 

ferrous scrap comes from two primary sources i manufacturers and industrial plants metal fabrication plants machine shops and factories which generate steel scrap referred to as prompt or industrial scrap and ii scrap dealers retail individuals auto wreckers demolition firms and others who generate steel and iron scrap referred to as obsolete scrap market demand and the composition quality size weight and location of the materials are the primary factors that determine prices we purchase nonferrous scrap from three primary sources i manufacturers and other nonferrous scrap sources which generate or sell scrap aluminum copper stainless steel and other nonferrous metals ii producers of electricity telecommunication service providers aerospace defense and recycling companies that generate nonferrous scrap consisting primarily of copper wire aluminum beverage cans and various other metals and alloys and iii retail individuals who deliver directly to our facilities material which they collect from a variety of sources omnisource continues to expand its number of retail yards in strategic locations to increase costeffective scrap sourcing we also collect ferrous and nonferrous scrap from sources other than those that are delivered directly to our processing facilities by placing retrieval containers near these sources the containers are subsequently transported to our processing facilities 

our metals recycling facilities consist of offices warehouse buildings and openair collection and processing facilities of various sizes and acreages equipped with specialized equipment for processing both ferrous and nonferrous metal where we receive sort process and store the metals we equip our facilities with scales shears baling presses briquetting machines conveyors and magnetic separators which enable us to efficiently process large volumes of scrap metals to facilitate processing shipping and receiving we equip our ferrous metal processing centers with shredders or hydraulic shears and presses to prepare and compress scrap metal for easier handling cranes are utilized to handle scrap metals for processing and to load material for shipment many of our facilities have rail access as ferrous scrap is primarily shipped by open gondola railcar additionally several of the metals recycling divisions have achieved certifications including iso 90012008 and iso 140012004 certification we continue to make improvements such as the development and implementation of downstream separation technology at two of our locations which further enhances the recovery of nonferrous materials from residual shredded material and decreases related landfill costs 

products our metals recycling operations primarily involve the purchase processing and resale of ferrous and nonferrous scrap metals into reusable forms and grades 

we process an array of ferrous products used in foundry and steel mill applications for use in our own steel mills or for resale to other customers through a variety of methods including sorting shredding shearing cutting torching baling briquetting and breaking our major ferrous products include heavy melting steel busheling bundled scrap shredded scrap and other scrap metal products such as steel turnings and cast iron these products vary in properties or attributes related to cleanness size of individual pieces and residual alloys these factors are determined by the specific needs and requirements of the consumer and affect the individual products relative value we process nonferrous products including aluminum brass copper stainless steel and other nonferrous metals for use in foundry mill refining and smelting applications our superior aluminum alloys operations produce specification aluminum alloys in the form of ingots sows and molten metal in addition we provide transportation logistics truck rail and river barge management services marketing brokerage and consulting services related to the scrap industry 

customers we sell processed ferrous scrap to endusers such as steel producing minimills integrated steelmakers foundries secondary smelters and metal brokers who aggregate materials for other large users most of our ferrous scrap customers purchase processed scrap through negotiated spot sales contracts which establish a quantity purchase for the month the price we charge for ferrous scrap depends upon market demand and transportation costs as well as the quality and grade of the scrap in many cases our selling price also includes the cost of transportation to the enduser 

we sell processed nonferrous scrap to endusers such as specialty steelmakers foundries aluminum sheet and ingot manufacturers copper refineries and smelters brass and bronze ingot manufacturers wire and cable producers utilities and telephone networks 

markets according to the institute of scrap recycling industries isri approximately 75 million metric tons and 74 million metric tons of recycled iron and steel including stainless and alloys were processed in the united states during 2012 and 2011 respectively in addition approximately nine million metric tons of nonferrous scrap including aluminum copper lead and zinc were processed during both 2012 and 2011 scrap is a global commodity influenced by conditions in a number of industrialized and emergingmarkets throughout asia europe and north america isri estimates that approximately 20 million metric tons and 23 million metric tons of ferrous scrap were exported from the united states in 2012 and 2011 respectively nonferrous exports from the united states were estimated by isri to be 33 million metric tons and 34 million metric tons in 2012 and 2011 respectively 

scrap metal supplies are generated from a variety of sources industrial scrap or home scrap is generated from steel processing and manufacturing facilities utilizing steel in their production process obsolete scrap including post consumer waste demolition of steel structures and automobiles represent a significant source of scrap generation we do not purchase a material amount of scrap metal from a single source or from a limited number of major sources 

competitors the markets for scrap metals are highly competitive both in the purchase of raw scrap and the sale of processed scrap with regard to the purchase of raw scrap we compete with numerous independent recyclers as well as smaller scrap companies engaged only in collecting industrial scrap in many cases we also purchase unprocessed scrap metal from smaller scrap dealers and other processors successful procurement of materials is determined primarily by the price offered by the purchaser for the raw scrap and the proximity of our processing facility to the source of the raw scrap both ferrous and nonferrous scrap sells as a commodity in both national and international markets which are affected by relative economic conditions currency fluctuations and the availability and cost of transportation competition for sales of processed scrap is based primarily on the price quality and location of the scrap metals as well as the level of service provided in terms of reliability and timing of delivery 

we also face potential competition for sales of processed scrap from other producers of steel products such as integrated steel mills and steel minimills some of which are vertically integrated in the scrap metals recycling business in addition other steel mills may compete with us in attempting to secure scrap supply through direct purchasing from our scrap suppliers scrap metal processors also face competition from substitutes for prepared ferrous scrap such as prereduced iron pellets hot briquetted iron pig iron iron carbide and other forms of processed iron the availability and relative prices of substitutes for ferrous scrap could result in a decreased demand for processed ferrous scrap and could result in lower prices andor lower demand for our scrap products 

the industry is highly fragmented with many smaller familyowned companies although omnisource also competes with a number of national and global companies each of which has multiple locations in areas in which omnisource also operates these larger entities include the david j joseph company a subsidiary of nucor corporation sims metal management psc metals aleris international cmc a division of commercial metals company and schnitzer steel in addition omnisource competes with many regional scrap companies no single scrap metals recycler has a significant market share in the domestic market 

ferrous resources 

iron dynamics idi 

iron dynamics developed a process of producing liquid pig iron and hot briquetted iron hbi that serves as a substitute for a portion of the metallic raw material mix that goes into our electric arc furnaces to produce steel direct reduced iron dri is a metallic product made from millscale and iron ore fines that has been reduced in a rotary hearth furnace using natural gas and coal the reduction method employed by idi uses coal as the reducing agent the dri is either compacted by briquetters to form hbi or is processed further to produce liquid pig iron hbi can be immediately used in our melting furnaces or stockpiled for later use liquid pig iron is tapped from idis submerged arc furnace and immediately transferred in ladles to the flat roll divisions melt shop where it is combined with scrap steel in the mills electric arc furnaces 

the plants primary focus is to maximize liquid pig iron production due to the inherent economic benefits achieved when the material is used in the steelmaking process such as reduced energy cost reduced materials cost and quicker melting cycles during 2013 and 2012 respectively idi produced 255000 and 226000 metric tons of which 239000 metric tons or 94 and 208000 metric tons or 

92 was liquid pig iron we have used and plan to use all of the facilitys output in our flat roll division steelmaking operations 

minnesota iron operations—mesabi nugget mesabi mining and mining resources 

our minnesota iron operations consists of mesabi nugget owned 81 by us our potential future iron mining operations which is currently in the permitting process mesabi mining and our iron tailings operations mining resources owned 80 by us mesabi nugget is the worlds first commercial ironmaking facility to use the itmk3® process an ironnugget production technology pioneered by kobe steel ltd which they are licensing to the venture the facilitys designed annual production capacity is 500000 metric tons the mesabi nugget facility production of iron nuggets commenced in 2010 we have from time to time experienced operational quality control or production cost challenges in implementing this ironmaking process and have continued to modify reengineer and further refine this process we have also changed or modified equipment configurations with resulting increased plant availability increased production and improved quality in 2013 2012 and 2011 mesabi nugget produced 214000 178000 and 156000 metric tons of ironnuggets respectively for use by our own steel mills having substantiated the capability of nearterm volume expectations our primary focus turned to increasing product yield and reducing raw material and other production costs certain meaningful adjunct trials that began in the latter half of the fourth quarter have continued in the first quarter of 2014 with some encouraging results however toward the end of the first quarter of 2014 we expect that we will be able to assess whether or to what extent further process improvements if any are justifiable our mining resources operations which involve the extraction of iron tailings from previously developed stockpiles or waterfilled tailings basins provide iron ore tailings to be concentrated for use by mesabi nugget as lowcost iron concentrate to the nugget production process mining resources started operations in 2012 and effectively ramped up operations in 2013 producing 407000 and 56000 metric tons of iron tailings during 2013 and 2012 respectively the impact of losses from our minnesota iron operations on 2013 net income was approximately 42 million or 018 per diluted share 

sources availability and cost of steel and other operations raw materials 

scrap metals our principal raw material of our steel operations segment is scrap metal derived from among other sources home scrap generated internally at steel mills themselves industrial scrap generated as a byproduct of manufacturing and obsolete scrap recycled from endoflife automobiles appliances railroad cars and railroad track materials agricultural machinery and demolition scrap from obsolete structures containers and machines 

scrap typically comprises more than 80 of the metallic melt mix in electric arc furnace steelmaking in contrast to integrated mill steelmaking where the proportion of scrap has traditionally been approximately 25 to 35 depending upon the scrap substitute material that may be available from time to time and the relative cost of such material the percentage of scrap used in our steelmaking operations could be reduced in our metallic melt mix 

many variables can impact scrap prices all of which reflect the pushes and pulls of the supply demand equation these factors include the level of us new steel production for highquality lowresidual scrap is a byproduct of new steel manufacturing activity the level of exports of scrap from the united states the amount of obsolete scrap production and the effect of speculation on the amount of scrap offered on the market from time to time generally as domestic steel demand increases so does scrap demand and resulting scrap prices the reverse is also normally but not always true with scrap prices following steel prices downward when supply exceeds demand 

the following table provides pricing per gross ton from american metal market and iron age pig iron estimates for ferrous materials used in steel production 

the price of steel scrap as a commodity has tended to be volatile rising and falling with supply and demand and not always in lock step with or in proportion to the market price of new steel when scrap costs greatly accelerate this threatens one of the principal elements of a minimills traditional lower cost structure—the cost of its metallic raw material therefore having a lower cost alternative source of iron for a portion of a minimills melt mix if realizable would partially buffer the effects of high scrap prices and scrap price volatility with the growing proportion of electric furnace steelmaking both worldwide and domestically we believe that the benefit of developing a costeffective alternate iron source to augment scrap our primary raw material makes good economic sense in the long run 

iron units in addition to scrap direct reduced iron hot briquetted iron pig iron and ironnuggets are used in electric arc furnace minimill steel production during 2013 and 2012 we consumed 63 million tons and 60 million tons respectively of metallic materials in our steel making furnaces of which iron units other than scrap represented approximately 8 of the tons of these iron substitute units consumed our iron dynamics and mesabi nugget operations together supplied 95 and 90 of these iron units in 2013 and 2012 respectively 

iron concentrate and coal at our mesabi nugget operations iron concentrate and coal represent the most significant raw material inputs necessary to iron nugget production we historically had obtained all our iron concentrate needs from reliable external sources these external sources generally priced the iron concentrate quarterly with the price driven largely by a small number of suppliers and the global market for iron iron concentrate costs were therefore outside our control and could change independent of other ferrous scrap costs development of our own more stable lowcost iron concentrate sources like mining resources in late 2012 was a very meaningful step in securing a more stable supply of much lower cost iron units 

coal pricing is typically set annually and although supply is generally sufficient as there are ample reliable sources domestically unexpected mine outages can interrupt availability and potentially increase our costs given the annual pricing and the potential supply interruptions the cost of coal may not correlate with the ever changing environment of iron unit scrap and steel pricing 



our steel fabrication operations new millennium building systems primarily serve the nonresidential construction industry our facilities operating in butler indiana lake city florida salem virginia hope arkansas fallon nevada and juarez mexico give us a national footprint that allows us to service the entire us construction market as well as national accounts such as large retail chains 

we fabricate trusses girders steel joists and steel decking primarily for the nonresidential building components market total production of all products was 367000 tons and 295000 tons during 2013 and 2012 respectively our flat roll division and roanoke bar division supply a substantial portion of the steel utilized in these manufacturing operations 

products our fabrication operations produce steel building components including steel joists girders and trusses our individual joist products include bowstring arched scissor doublepitched and singlepitched joists our indiana florida virginia and arkansas plants also produce a full range of steel roof form and composite floor decking 

customers our primary fabrication customers are nonresidential steel fabricators other customers include metal building companies general construction contractors developers brokers and governmental entities our customers are located throughout the united states including national accounts 

markets our fabrication operations primarily serve the nonresidential construction industry the downturn and slow recovery in the nonresidential construction markets has resulted in demand for joist and deck products to decrease from previous levels seen in 2008 and prior the steel joist and deck market in the united states was approximately 12 million tons in 2011 increased to 13 million tons in 2012 and further increased to 15 million tons in 2013 per the steel manufacturers association we believe we are well positioned with our national footprint to continue to grow as the market strengthens as we presently have unused capacity that can be deployed as needed we believe the longterm prospects for this business are sound and market indices increases in the latter half of 2013 provide some positive signs of recovery 

competitors our main competitors in the joist business are vulcraft a division of nucor corporation canam group quincy joist co valley joist and seyco joist in the steel decking business new millenniums main competitors are vulcraft consolidated systems inc and canam group 

energy resources 

electricity electricity is a significant input required in the electric arc furnaces in our steelmaking operations excluding the techs representing 5 of steel production costs of goods sold in 2013 and 2012 we have entered into a fixed price interruptible electricity supply agreement that extends through december 31 2014 for our flat roll division in butler indiana the contract allows our supplier to interrupt service in the event of an emergency or in response to various market conditions our roanoke bar division and steel of west virginia have entered into fixed price contracts while our engineered bar products division has a combination of fixed pricing and market pricing for the various components of the electrical services demand charge energy charge riders etc our structural and rail division purchases electricity at current market prices 

natural gas we purchase a portion of our steel operations natural gas requirements at market prices and a portion by entering into hedging transactions on the futures markets for ultimate physical delivery in order to help minimize price volatility these contracts typically have duration of up to 

24 months but on occasion may extend further natural gas represented 13 of steel operations excluding the techs costs of goods sold in both 2013 and 2012

environmental matters 

our steel operations metals recycling and ferrous resources operations and steel fabrication operations are subject to substantial and evolving local state and federal environmental health and safety laws and regulations concerning among other things emissions to the air discharges to surface and ground water and to sewer systems and the generation handling storage transportation treatment and disposal of toxic and hazardous substances our manufacturing operations are dependent upon both state and federal permits regulating discharges into the air or into the water in order to operate our facilities we believe that in all current respects our steel operations metals recycling and ferrous resources operations and steel fabrication operations are in material compliance with all provisions of federal and state laws concerning the environment and we do not currently believe that future compliance with such provisions will have a material adverse effect on our results of operations cash flows or financial condition 

since the level of enforcement of environmental laws and regulations or the nature of those laws that may be enacted from time to time are sometimes subject to changing social or political pressures our environmental capital expenditures and costs for environmental compliance may increase in the future in addition due to the possibility of unanticipated regulatory or other developments the amount and timing of future environmental expenditures may vary substantially from those currently anticipated the cost of current and future environmental compliance may also place us steel producers at a competitive disadvantage with respect to foreign steel producers which may not be required to undertake equivalent costs in their operations 

pursuant to the resource conservation and recovery act or rcra which governs the treatment handling and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes the united states environmental protection agency or us epa and authorized state environmental agencies conduct inspections of rcra 

regulated facilities to identify areas where there may have been releases of solid or hazardous constituents into the environment and require the facilities to take corrective action to remediate any such releases rcra also allows citizens to bring certain suits against regulated facilities for potential damages and cleanup our steelmaking and certain other facilities are subject to rcra our manufacturing operations produce various byproducts some of which for example electric arc furnace or eaf dust are categorized as industrial or hazardous waste requiring special handling for disposal or for the recovery of metallics we collect such coproducts in approved baghouses and other facilities but we are also examining alternative reclamation technologies to recycle some of these products while we cannot predict the future actions of the regulators or other interested parties the potential exists for required corrective action at these facilities the costs of which could be substantial 

under the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act or cercla the us epa and in some instances private parties have the authority to impose joint and several liability for the remediation of contaminated properties upon generators of waste current and former site owners and operators transporters and other potentially responsible parties regardless of fault or the legality of the original disposal activity many states have statutes and regulatory authorities similar to cercla and to the us epa we have a number of waste handling agreements with various contractors to properly dispose of our electric arc furnace dust and certain other waste products of steelmaking however we cannot assure that even if there has been no fault by us we may not still be cited as a waste generator by reason of an environmental cleanup at a site to which our waste products were transported 

in addition to rcra and cercla there are a number of other environmental health and safety laws and regulations that apply to our facilities and may affect our operations by way of example and not of limitation certain portions of the federal clean air act clean water act toxic substances control act oil pollution act safe drinking water act and emergency planning and community righttoknow act as well as state and local laws and regulations implemented by the regulatory agencies apply to our facilities operations many of these laws allow both the governments and citizens to bring certain suits against regulated facilities for alleged environmental violations finally any steelmaking and metals recycling company could be subject to certain toxic tort suits brought by citizens or other third parties alleging causes of action such as nuisance negligence trespass infliction of emotional distress or other claims alleging personal injury or property damage 

employees 

our work force consisted of approximately 6870 full time employees at december 31 2013 of which approximately 11 were represented by collective bargaining agreements the largest group of unionized employees is at steel of west virginia the remaining unionized employees are located in five different omnisource metals recycling locations each of which has its own agreement we believe that our relationship with our employees is good

 item 1a risk factors 

  many factors could have an effect on our financial condition cash flows and results of operations we are subject to various risks resulting from changing economic environmental political industry business and financial conditions the factors described below represent our principal risks  

risks related to our industry 

our industry is affected by domestic and global economic factors including the risk of a recession 

our financial results are substantially dependent not only upon overall economic conditions in the united states in europe and in asia but also as they may affect one or more of the industries upon which we depend for the sale of our products the moderate pace of the recovery from the deep global recession that began in the united states in 2008 has had an adverse effect on demand for our products and margins and therefore the results of our operations prolongation of the recovery from the recession could stifle improving customer confidence and adversely affect demand for our products and further adversely affect our business metals industries have historically been vulnerable to significant declines in consumption and product pricing during periods of economic downturn likewise the pace of domestic nonresidential construction activity has historically slowed during economic downturns as seen with the historically low levels in recent years the recovery in this industry could be prolonged further than other sectors of the domestic economy 

our business is also dependent upon certain industries such as commercial and government construction energy metals service centers automotive agriculture transportation petrochemical and original equipment manufacturing and these industries are also cyclical in nature therefore these industries may experience their own fluctuations in demand for our products based on such things as economic conditions energy prices consumer demand and infrastructure funding decisions by governments many of these factors are beyond our control as a result of the volatility in the industries we serve we may have difficulty increasing or maintaining our level of sales or profitability if the industries we serve were to suffer a downturn then our business may be adversely affected 

our level of production and our sales and earnings are subject to significant fluctuations as a result of the cyclical nature of the steel industry and some of the industries we serve 

the steel manufacturing business is cyclical in nature and the price of the steel we make may fluctuate significantly due to many factors beyond our control furthermore many of our products are commodities subject to their own cyclical fluctuations in supply and demand in both metal consuming and metal generating industries including the construction industry the timing magnitude and duration of these cycles and the resulting price fluctuations are difficult to predict the sale of our manufactured steel products is directly affected by demand for our products in other cyclical industries such as the automotive oil and gas gas transmission residential and commercialindustrial construction commercial equipment rail transportation appliance agricultural and durable goods industries economic difficulties stagnant economies supplydemand imbalances and currency fluctuations in the united states or globally could decrease the demand for our products or increase the amount of imports of steel into the united states which could decrease our sales margins and profitability 

the scrap metal recycling industry has historically been and is expected to remain highly cyclical and this could have a material adverse effect on our metals recycling operations results 

scrap metal prices are volatile and operating results within the metals recycling industry in general have historically been cyclical and are expected to remain highly cyclical in nature similarly but not necessarily paralleling the price fluctuations in the steel business the purchase prices for automobile bodies and various other grades of obsolete and industrial scrap as well as the selling prices for 

processed and recycled scrap metals we utilize in our own manufacturing process or we resell to others through our metals recycling operations are also highly volatile during periods of increased imports scrap metal prices may become depressed and adversely affect the sales profitability and margins of our scrap business as a metals recycler we may attempt to respond to changing recycled metal selling prices by adjusting the scrap metal purchase prices we pay to others but our ability to do this may be limited by competitive or other factors during periods of low scrap prices when inbound scrap flow may slow considerably as scrap generators hold on to their scrap in hopes of getting higher prices later as such a prolonged period of low scrap prices could reduce our ability to obtain process and sell recycled materials and this could adversely affect our metals recycling operations results conversely periodic increased foreign demand for scrap can result in an outflow of available domestic scrap as well as resulting higher scrap prices domestically that cannot always be passed on to domestic scrap consumers thereby further reducing available domestic scrap flows and scrap margins all of which could adversely affect our sales and profitability of our scrap business additionally due to these periods of high demand ferrous scrap consumers are seeking and developing ferrous scrap alternatives including direct reduced iron penetration of these scrap alternatives into the domestic market may have a longer term impact on scrap pricing particularly in prime grades which could adversely affect our sales profitability and margins 

imports of steel into the united states have in the past adversely affected and may again adversely affect us steel prices which could impact our sales margins and profitability 

global steelmaking capacity currently exceeds global consumption of steel products such excess capacity sometimes results in steel manufacturers in certain countries exporting steel at prices that are lower than prevailing domestic prices and sometimes at or below their cost of production excessive imports of steel into the united states as a result of excess world supply have in the past exerted and may again in the future exert downward pressure on us steel prices and may reduce or may negatively affect our ability to increase our sales margins and profitability this may also adversely impact domestic demand for ferrous scrap and our ferrous metallics margins us steel producers compete with many foreign producers including those in china competition from foreign producers is typically strong and is periodically exacerbated by weakening of the economies of certain foreign steelmaking countries greater steel exports to the united states tend to occur at depressed prices when steel producing countries experience periods of economic difficulty decreased demand for steel products or excess capacity 

in addition we believe the downward pressure on and periodically depressed levels of us steel prices in some recent years have been further exacerbated by imports of steel involving dumping and subsidy abuses by foreign steel producers some foreign steel producers are owned controlled or subsidized by foreign governments as a result decisions by these producers with respect to their production sales and pricing are sometimes influenced to a greater degree by political and economic policy considerations than by prevailing market conditions realities of the marketplace or consideration of profit or loss however while some tariffs and quotas are periodically put into effect for certain steel products imported from a number of countries that have been found to have been unfairly pricing steel imports to the us there is no assurance that tariffs and quotas will always be levied even if otherwise justified and even when imposed many of these are only shortlived when such tariffs or duties expire or if others are further relaxed or repealed or if relatively higher us steel prices make it attractive for foreign steelmakers to export their steel products to the united states despite the presence of duties or tariffs the resurgence of substantial imports of foreign steel could create downward pressure on us steel prices 

chinas current steelmaking overcapacity in relation to its steel consumption could have a material adverse effect on domestic and global steel pricing and could result in increased steel imports into the united states 

a significant factor in the worldwide volatility of steel pricing in recent years was the explosive growth in chinese steel consumption in relation to its domestic production which until the third quarter of 2008 had vastly outpaced that countrys capacity to produce steel in sufficient quantity to serve its internal demand the shortage of chinese domestic steel supply during this time period resulted not only in heightened chinese demand for imported steel and other raw materials with a consequent upward spiral in worldwide steel pricing for finished steel products but also led to a rapid and significant expansion of steel production capacity in china as well as many of the commodities supplies and services utilized in steelmaking however the addition of new chinese steel production capacity coupled with the subsequent slower growth in chinese steel consumption that began in 2008 and the continued utilization of a large amount of outdated inefficient and government subsidized production capacity has resulted in a situation in which chinas steel producing capacity exceeds that countrys demand for many kinds of steel products that we produce and has made china an increasingly larger net exporter of steel therefore a combination of a slowdown in chinas economic growth rate and steel consumption coupled with its own expansion of steelmaking capacity could result in stagnation or weakening of both domestic and global steel demand and steel pricing also should chinese steelmaking capacity remain the same or further increase or should its demand either further slow or weaken china might not only remain a net exporter of steel but many asian and european steel producers whose steel output previously fed chinas steel import needs could find their way into the us market through increased steel imports causing a further erosion of margins or negatively impacting our ability to increase our prices 

the worldwide economic downturn that began in 2008 and the difficult conditions in the global industrial capital and credit markets that resulted have adversely affected and may continue to adversely affect our industry as well as the industries of many of our customers and suppliers upon whom we are dependent 

many of the markets in which our customers participate such as the automotive consumer products original equipment agriculture transportation manufacturing commercial residential and government construction energy and metals service center industries are cyclical in nature and experience significant fluctuations in demand for our steel products based on economic conditions consumer demand raw material and energy costs and decisions by our government to fund or not fund infrastructure projects such as highways bridges schools energy plants railroads and transportation facilities many of these factors are beyond our control these markets are highly competitive to a large extent driven by enduse markets and may experience overcapacity all of which may affect demand for and pricing of our products 

a decline in consumer and business confidence and spending together with reductions in the availability of credit or increased cost of credit as well as volatility in the capital and credit markets could adversely affect the business and economic environment in which we operate and the profitability of our business we are also exposed to risks associated with the creditworthiness of our suppliers and customers if the availability of credit to fund or support the continuation and expansion of our customers business operations is curtailed or if the cost of that credit is increased the resulting inability of our customers or of their customers to access either credit or absorb the increased cost of that credit could adversely affect our business by reducing our sales or by increasing our exposure to losses from uncollectible customer accounts a renewed disruption of the credit markets could also result in financial instability of some of our suppliers and customers the consequences of such adverse effects could include the interruption of production at the facilities of our customers the reduction delay or cancellation of customer orders delays or interruptions of the supply of raw materials we purchase and bankruptcy of customers suppliers or other creditors any of these events may adversely affect our profitability cash flow and financial condition 

volatility and major fluctuations in scrap metal and pig iron prices and our potential inability to pass higher costs on to our customers may constrain operating levels and reduce profit margins 

steel producers require large amounts of raw materials including scrap metal and scrap substitute products such as pig iron pelletized iron and other supplies such as graphite electrodes and ferroalloys our principal raw material is scrap metal derived primarily from junked automobiles industrial scrap railroad cars railroad track materials agricultural machinery and demolition scrap from obsolete structures containers and machines the prices for scrap are subject to market forces largely beyond our control including demand by us and international steel producers freight costs and speculation the prices for scrap have varied significantly may vary significantly in the future and do not necessarily fluctuate in tandem with the price of steel moreover some of our integrated steel producer competitors are not as dependent as we are on scrap as a part of their raw material melt mix which during periods of high scrap costs relative to the cost of blast furnace iron used by the integrated producers give them a raw material cost advantage over minimills while our vertical integration into the metals recycling business through our omnisource operations and into the ironmaking business through our iron dynamics facility and our minnesota iron operations should enable us to continue being a costeffective supplier to our steelmaking operations for some of our metallics requirements we will still need to rely on other metallics and raw material suppliers as well as upon general industry supply conditions for the balance of our needs 

purchase prices for auto bodies scrap metal and scrap substitute products such as pig iron that we consume and selling prices for scrap and recycled metals that we sell to third parties are volatile and beyond our control while omnisource attempts to respond to changing recycled metal selling prices through adjustments to its metal purchase prices its ability to do so is limited by competitive and other market factors changing prices could potentially impact the volume of scrap metal available to us and the volume and realized margins of processed metals we sell 

the availability and prices of raw materials may also be negatively affected by new laws and regulations allocation by suppliers interruptions in production accidents or natural disasters changes in exchange rates worldwide price fluctuations and the availability and cost of transportation 

if prices for ferrous metallics increase by a greater margin than corresponding price increases for the sale of our steel products we may not be able to recoup such cost increases from increases in the selling prices of steel products conversely depressed prices for ferrous scrap may constrain the supply of steel scrap which may adversely affect our metals recycling operations and also the availability of certain grades of scrap for our steelmaking operations additionally our inability to pass on all or any substantial part of any cost increases during periods of rapidly rising scrap prices through scrap or other surcharges or to provide for our customers needs because of the potential unavailability of key raw materials or other inputs may result in production curtailments or may otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations or prospects 

the cost and availability of electricity and natural gas are also subject to volatile market conditions 

steel producers like us consume large amounts of energy inasmuch as minimills melt steel scrap in electric arc furnaces and use natural gas to heat steel billets for rolling into finished products we rely on third parties for the supply of energy resources we consume in our steelmaking activities the prices for and availability of electricity natural gas oil and other energy resources are also subject to volatile market conditions often affected by weather conditions as well as political and economic factors beyond our control as large consumers of electricity and gas we must have dependable delivery in order to operate accordingly we are at risk in the event of an energy disruption prolonged blackouts or brownouts or disruptions caused by natural disasters or by political considerations would substantially disrupt our production in addition a significant portion of our finished steel products are delivered by truck unforeseen fluctuations in the price of fuel attributable to fluctuations in crude oil 

prices would also have a negative impact on our costs or on the costs of many of our customers in addition changes in certain environmental regulations in the us including those that may impose output limitations or higher costs associated with climate change or greenhouse gas emissions legislation could substantially increase the cost of manufacturing and raw materials such as energy to us and other us steel producers 

fluctuations in the value of the united states dollar relative to other currencies may adversely affect our business 

fluctuations in the value of the dollar can be expected to affect our business a strong us dollar makes imported metal products less expensive potentially resulting in more imports of steel products into the us by our foreign competitors while a weak us dollar may have the opposite impact on imports 

compliance with and changes in environmental and remediation requirements could result in substantially increased capital requirements and operating costs 

existing laws or regulations as currently interpreted or as may be interpreted in the future as well as future laws or regulations may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

we are subject to comprehensive local state federal and international statutory and regulatory environmental requirements relating to among other things 

• the acceptance storage treatment handling and disposal of solid and hazardous waste • the discharge of materials into the air • the management and treatment of wastewater and storm water • the remediation of soil and groundwater contamination • global climate change legislation or regulation • the need for and the ability to timely obtain air water or other operating permits • the remediation and reclamation of land used for iron mining • natural resource damages and • the protection of our employees health and safety compliance with environmental laws and regulations which affect our steelmaking metals recycling and ironmaking operations is a significant factor in our business we are required to obtain and comply with environmental permits and licenses and failure to obtain or renew or the violation of any permit or license if not remedied could result in substantial fines and penalties suspension of operations or the closure of a subject facility similarly delays increased costs or the imposition of onerous conditions to the securing or renewal of operating permits such as those required by our mesabi mining mesabi nugget or mining resources ironmaking operations could have a material adverse effect on these operations 

private parties might also bring claims against us for alleged property damage or personal injury resulting from the environmental impacts of our operations moreover legal requirements change frequently are subject to interpretation and have tended to become more stringent over time uncertainty regarding adequate pollution control levels testing and sampling procedures and new pollution control technology are factors that may increase our future compliance expenditures we are unable to predict the ultimate cost of future compliance with these requirements or their effect on our operations and we also cannot predict whether such costs can be passed on to customers through 

product price increases although we believe that we are in substantial compliance with all applicable laws and regulations legal requirements frequently change and are subject to interpretation new laws regulations and changing interpretations by regulatory authorities together with uncertainty regarding adequate pollution control levels testing and sampling procedures new pollution control technology and cost benefit analysis based on market conditions are all factors that may increase our future expenditures to comply with environmental requirements the cost of complying with existing laws or regulations as currently interpreted or reinterpreted in the future or with future laws or regulations may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

our manufacturing and recycling operations produce significant amounts of byproducts some of which are handled as industrial waste or hazardous waste for example our mills generate electric arc furnace eaf dust which the united states environmental protection agency usepa and other regulatory authorities classify as hazardous waste eaf dust requires special handling recycling and disposal 

in addition the primary feed materials for the shredders operated by our metals recycling operations are automobile hulks and obsolete household appliances approximately 20 of the weight of an automobile hulk consists of unrecyclable material known as shredder fluff after the segregation of ferrous and saleable nonferrous metals shredder fluff remains we along with others in the recycling industry interpret federal regulations to require shredder fluff to meet certain criteria and pass a toxic leaching test to avoid classification as a hazardous waste we also endeavor to remove hazardous contaminants from the feed material prior to shredding as a result we believe the shredder fluff we generate is not normally considered or classified as hazardous waste however if laws or regulations the interpretation of the laws or regulations or testing methods change with regard to eaf dust or shredder fluff we may incur significant additional expenditures 

the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act cercla or superfund enables us epa and state agencies to recover from owners operators generators and transporters the cost of investigation and cleanup of sites which pose serious threats to the environment or public health in connection with cercla and analogous state laws we may be required to clean up contamination discovered at our sites including contamination that may have been caused by former owners or operators of the sites conduct additional cleanup at sites where we have already participated in remediation efforts or to take remediation action with regard to sites formerly used in connection with our operations 

in addition we may be required to pay for or to pay a portion of the costs of remediation at sites to which we sent hazardous wastes for disposal notwithstanding that the original disposal activity may have complied with all regulatory requirements then in effect pursuant to cercla a potentially responsible party can be held jointly and severally liable for all of the cleanup costs associated with a thirdparty disposal site in practice a liable party often splits the costs of cleanup with other potentially responsible parties we have received notices from us epa state agencies and third parties that we have been identified as potentially responsible for the cost of investigating and cleaning up a number of thirdparty disposal sites in most cases many other parties are also named as potentially responsible parties based upon information currently available to us we do not believe the potential cost in connection with the remediation of these sites will have a material effect on our business 

because cercla can be imposed retroactively on shipments that occurred many years ago and because us epa and state agencies are still discovering sites that pose a threat to public health or the environment we can provide no assurance that we will not become liable in the future for significant costs associated with investigation and remediation of additional cercla cleanup sites 

cercla including the superfund recycling equity act of 1999 limits the exposure of scrap metal recyclers for sales of certain recyclable material under certain circumstances however the recycling defense is subject to the conducting of reasonable care evaluations of current and potential consuming facilities 

increased regulation associated with climate change and greenhouse gas emissions could impose significant additional costs on both our steelmaking and metals recycling operations 

the united states government or various governmental agencies may introduce regulatory changes in response to the potential impacts of climate change international treaties or agreements may also result in increasing regulation of greenhouse gas emissions including the introduction of carbon emissions trading mechanisms any such regulation regarding climate change and greenhouse gas or ghg emissions could impose significant costs on our steelmaking and metals recycling operations and on the operations of our customers and suppliers including increased energy capital equipment environmental monitoring and reporting and other costs in order to comply with current or future laws or regulations concerning and limitations imposed on our operations by virtue of climate change and ghg emissions laws and regulations the potential costs of allowances offsets or credits that may be part of potential capandtrade programs or similar future regulatory measures are still uncertain any adopted future climate change and ghg regulations could negatively impact our ability and that of our customers and suppliers to compete with companies situated in areas not subject to such limitations furthermore recently promulgated more restrictive national ambient air quality standards make it substantially more time consuming costly and difficult to obtain new permits or to modify existing permits 

from a medium and longterm perspective we are likely to see an increase in costs relating to our assets that emit significant amounts of greenhouse gases as a result of these regulatory initiatives these regulatory initiatives will be either voluntary or mandatory and may impact our operations directly or through our suppliers or customers until the timing scope and extent of any future regulation becomes known we cannot predict the effect on our financial condition operating performance and ability to compete 

risks related to the business 

our senior secured credit facility contains and any future financing agreements may contain restrictive covenants that may limit our flexibility 

restrictions and covenants in our existing debt agreements including our senior secured credit facility and any future financing agreements may impair our ability to finance future operations or capital needs or to engage in other business activities specifically these agreements may limit or restrict our ability to 

• incur additional indebtedness • pay dividends or make distributions with respect to our capital stock in excess of certain amounts • repurchase or redeem capital stock • make some investments • create liens and enter into sale and leaseback transactions • make some capital expenditures • enter into transactions with affiliates or related persons • issue or sell stock of certain subsidiaries • sell or transfer assets and • participate in some joint ventures acquisitions or mergers 29 

a breach of any of the restrictions or covenants could cause a default under our senior secured credit facility our senior notes or our other debt a significant portion of our indebtedness then may become immediately due and payable if the default is not remedied 

under our senior secured credit facility we are required to maintain certain financial covenants tied to our leverage and profitability in addition we are subject to a quarterly borrowing base requirement limiting the maximum availability of our senior secured revolver our ability to meet such covenants or borrowing restrictions can be affected by events beyond our control if a default were to occur the lenders could elect to declare all amounts then outstanding to be immediately due and payable and terminate all commitments to extend further credit if we are unable to repay those amounts the lenders could proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure such indebtedness we have pledged substantially all of our receivables and inventories and all shares of capital stock or other equity interests of our subsidiaries and intercompany debt held by us as collateral for our senior secured credit facility 

we may face significant price and other forms of competition from other steel producers and scrap processors which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operation or prospects 

the global markets in which steel companies and scrap processors conduct business are highly competitive and became even more so due to the recent global economic downturn and consolidations in the steel and scrap industries increased competition could cause us to lose market share increase expenditures or reduce pricing any one of which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations or prospects the global steel industry has historically suffered from overcapacity and that excess capacity intensifies price competition in some of our products a decrease in the global demand for steel scrap due to market or other conditions generally causes a decrease in the price of scrap metals a decrease in price could result in some scrap generators exiting the marketplace which could further decrease the availability of scrap this shortage in availability of scrap could have a material adverse effect on both our steelmaking and our metals recycling operations and thus on our business financial condition results of operations or prospects 

we are subject to significant risks relating to changes in commodity prices and may not be able to effectively protect against these risks 

we are exposed to commodity price risk during periods where we hold title to scrap metal products that we may hold in inventory for processing or resale prices of commodities including scrap can be volatile due to numerous factors beyond our control in an increasing price environment for raw materials competitive conditions may limit our ability to pass on price increases to our consumers in a decreasing price environment for processed scrap we may not have the ability to fully recoup the cost of raw materials that we procure process and sell to our customers in addition new entrants into the market areas we serve could result in higher purchase prices for raw materials and lower margins from our scrap we have not hedged positions in certain commodities such as ferrous scrap where futures markets are not well established and where we may from time to time hedge our positions in certain nonferrous scrap transactions we could incur losses thus our sales and inventory position will be vulnerable to adverse changes in commodity prices which could materially adversely impact our operating and financial performance 

the profitability of our metals recycling operations depends in part on the availability of an adequate source of supply 

we procure our scrap inventory from numerous sources these suppliers generally are not bound by longterm contracts and have no obligation to sell recyclable metal to us in periods of low industry prices suppliers may elect to hold recyclable metal to wait for higher prices or intentionally slow their 

metal collection activities if a substantial number of suppliers cease selling recyclable metal to us we will be unable to recycle metal at desired levels and our results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected in addition a slowdown of industrial production in the united states reduces the supply of industrial grades of metal to the metal recycling industry resulting in our having less recyclable metal available to process and market 

we may face risks associated with the implementation of our growth strategy 

our growth strategy subjects us to various risks as part of our growth strategy we may expand existing facilities enter into new product or process initiatives build additional plants acquire other businesses and metals assets enter into joint ventures or form strategic alliances that we believe will complement our existing business these transactions will likely involve some or all of the following risks 

• the risk of entering markets in which we have little experience • the difficulty of competing for acquisitions and other growth opportunities with companies having materially greater financial resources than us • the inability to realize anticipated synergies or other benefits expected from an acquisition • the difficulty of integrating the new or acquired operations and personnel into our existing operations • the potential disruption of ongoing operations • the diversion of financial resources to new operations or acquired businesses • the diversion of management attention from other business concerns to new operations or acquired businesses • the loss of key employees and customers of acquired businesses • the potential exposure to unknown liabilities • the inability of management to maintain uniform standards controls procedures and policies • the difficulty of managing the growth of a larger company • the risk of becoming involved in labor commercial or regulatory disputes or litigation related to the new operations or acquired businesses • the risk of becoming more highly leveraged • the risk of contractual or operational liability to other venture participants or to third parties as a result of our participation • the inability to work efficiently with joint venture or strategic alliance partners and • the difficulties of terminating joint ventures or strategic alliances these initiatives or transactions might be required for us to remain competitive but we may not be able to complete any such transactions on favorable terms or obtain financing if necessary for such transactions on favorable terms future transactions may not improve our competitive position and business prospects as anticipated and if they do not our sales and earnings may be significantly reduced 

technology operating and startup risks as well as commodity market risks associated with our mesabi nugget ironmaking project may prevent us from realizing its anticipated benefits and could result in a loss of all or a part of our investment 

while we and certain of our current and former joint venture partners built and operated a successful small scale pilot plant on the mesabi iron range in minnesota for the production of a cost effective iron nugget using kobe steels proprietary itmk3® ironmaking process we have experienced numerous technology operational production quality control market and startup risks associated with the startup and operation of our worlds first full scale commercial nugget plant utilizing this technology there can be no assurance at this time however that our original expectations that this ironmaking project might be capable of consistently producing highquality iron nuggets for use as a scrap substitute feed stock in our steelmaking operations and in sufficient quantities and at a cost that will compare favorably with the cost of steel scrap and other more conventional scrap substitute products including pig iron will be achieved we encountered losses during the extended startup and actual operation of the project and have continued to encounter further losses cost overruns systems or process difficulties output quantity and quality limitations raw material consumption rate and cost issues as a result our capital costs have increased the expected cost benefits from the development of this iron nugget product have diminished and could be lost and we could lose all or a substantial portion of our investment in the project we have encountered and could continue to encounter additional commodity market risk if the cost to manufacture the nuggets continues to be greater than projected or if the relative market price of scrap and other scrap substitutes particularly pig iron for which this iron nugget product is intended as a lower cost substitute continues to be lower than projected which could render our nuggets noneconomical moreover we are undertaking certain ancillary ventures related to the ironmaking process such as our nearby mesabi mining facility for which we have been and are continuing to seek operating permits to allow us to mine taconite ore for use in the production of nuggets mining is a business in which we have no previous experience and which is also subject to possible permitting and environmental risks and uncertainties 

we are subject to litigation which could adversely affect our profitability 

we are involved in various routine litigation matters including administrative proceedings regulatory proceedings governmental investigations environmental matters and commercial and construction contract disputes we are involved along with eight other steel manufacturing companies in a class action antitrust complaint filed in federal court in chicago illinois which alleges a conspiracy to fix raise maintain and stabilize the price at which steel products were sold in the united states during a period between 2005 and 2007 by artificially restricting the supply of such steel products all but one of the complaints were brought on behalf of a purported class consisting of all direct purchasers of steel products the other complaint was brought on behalf of a purported class consisting of all indirect purchasers of steel products within the same time period a ninth complaint in december 2010 was brought on behalf of indirect purchasers of steel products in tennessee and has been consolidated with the original complaints all complaints seek treble damages and costs including reasonable attorney fees pre and postjudgment interest and injunctive relief in january 2009 steel dynamics and the other defendants filed a joint motion to dismiss all of the direct purchaser lawsuits but this motion was denied in june 2009 following a period of preliminary discovery relating to class certification matters plaintiffs filed their motion for class certification in may 2012 and on february 28 2013 defendants filed their joint memorandum in opposition to plaintiffs motion for class certification together with joint motions to exclude the expert opinions of both of plaintiffs two retained experts on october 15 2013 plaintiffs submitted their reply papers and the defendants have submitted their additional responses as well a hearing on class certification and daubert issues has been scheduled for march 57 2014 

although not presently necessary or appropriate to make a dollar estimate of exposure to loss if any in connection with the above matter we may in the future determine that a loss accrual is necessary although we may make loss accruals if and as warranted any amounts that we may accrue from time to time could vary significantly from the amounts we actually pay due to inherent uncertainties and the inherent shortcomings of the estimation process the uncertainties involved in litigation and other factors additionally an adverse result could have a material effect on our financial condition results of operations and liquidity 

unexpected equipment downtime or shutdowns could adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and prospects 

interruptions in our production capabilities could adversely affect our production costs products available for sale and earnings during the affected period in addition to equipment failures our facilities are also subject to the risk of catastrophic loss due to unanticipated events such as fires explosions or violent weather conditions our manufacturing processes are dependent upon critical pieces of steelmaking equipment such as our furnaces continuous casters and rolling equipment as well as electrical equipment such as transformers this equipment may on occasion be out of service as a result of unanticipated failures or other events we have experienced and may in the future experience plant shutdowns or periods of reduced production as a result of such equipment failures or other events these disruptions could have an adverse effect on our operations customer service levels financial results and prospects 

governmental agencies may refuse to grant or renew some of our licenses and permits 

we must receive licenses air water and other permits and approvals from state and local governments to conduct certain of our operations such as our mesabi nugget and mesabi mining operations or to develop or acquire new facilities governmental agencies sometimes resist the establishment of certain types of facilities in their communities including scrap metal collection and processing facilities both mesabi nugget and mesabi mining have had difficulties securing or renewing all of their necessary permits and there can be no assurance that future approvals licenses and permits will be granted or that we will be able to maintain and renew the approvals licenses and permits we currently hold failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition

 item 3 legal proceedings 

we are involved in various routine litigation matters including administrative proceedings regulatory proceedings governmental investigations environmental matters and commercial and construction contract disputes none of which are expected to have a material impact on our financial condition results of operations or liquidity 

we are involved along with eight other steel manufacturing companies in a class action antitrust complaint filed in federal court in chicago illinois in september 2008 which alleges a conspiracy to fix raise maintain and stabilize the price at which steel products were sold in the united states starting in 2005 by artificially restricting the supply of such steel products all but one of the complaints were brought on behalf of a purported class consisting of all direct purchasers of steel products during a period between 2005 and 2007 the other complaint was brought on behalf of a purported class consisting of all indirect purchasers of steel products within the same time period a ninth complaint in december 2010 was brought on behalf of indirect purchasers of steel products in tennessee and has been consolidated with the original complaints all complaints seek treble damages and costs including reasonable attorney fees pre and postjudgment interest and injunctive relief in january 2009 steel dynamics and the other defendants filed a joint motion to dismiss all of the direct purchaser lawsuits but this motion was denied in june 2009 following a period of preliminary discovery relating to class certification matters plaintiffs filed their motion for class certification in may 2012 and on february 28 2013 defendants filed their joint memorandum in opposition to plaintiffs motion for class certification together with joint motions to exclude the expert opinions of both of plaintiffs two retained experts on october 15 2013 plaintiffs submitted their reply papers and the defendants have submitted their additional responses as well a hearing on class certification and daubert issues has been scheduled for march 57 2014 

due to the uncertain nature of litigation we cannot presently determine the ultimate outcome of this litigation however we have determined based on the information available at this time that there is not presently a reasonable possibility as that term is defined in asc 4502020 that the outcome of these legal proceedings would have a material impact on our financial condition results of operations or liquidity although not presently necessary or appropriate to make a dollar estimate of exposure to loss if any in connection with the above matter we may in the future determine that a loss accrual is necessary although we may make loss accruals if and as warranted any amounts that we may accrue from time to time could vary significantly from the amounts we actually pay due to inherent uncertainties and the inherent shortcomings of the estimation process the uncertainties involved in litigation and other factors additionally an adverse result could have a material effect on our financial condition results of operations and liquidity

overview 

we are one of the largest steel producers and one of the largest metals recyclers in the united states based on a current estimated annual steelmaking capability of 64 million tons and actual recycling volumes we reported net sales of 74 billion 73 billion and 80 billion during 2013 2012 and 2011 respectively the primary sources of our revenues are from the manufacture and sale of steel products processing and sale of recycled ferrous and nonferrous metals and to a lesser degree fabrication and sale of steel joist and decking products our operations are managed and reported based on three operating segments steel operations metals recycling and ferrous resources operations and steel fabrication operations 

actual steel and metals recycling ferrous and nonferrous shipments during 2013 2012 and 2011 are presented in the tables below 



during 2013 net sales of 74 billion and operating income of 3865 million was relatively unchanged from 2012 net sales of 73 billion and operating income of 3912 million despite generally higher shipments as 2013 full year metal margins declined for our steel and metals recycling operations however 2013 consolidated pretax income increased 588 million or 29 reflecting interest cost savings of 309 million and a reduction in refinancing costs of 377 million which were associated with our 2012 and early 2013 financing activities net income attributable to steel dynamics inc was 1893 million or 083 per diluted share in 2013 compared with 1636 million or 073 per diluted share in 2012 

in spite of record annual shipments in our steel operations compressed metal margins which we define as the difference between average selling prices and the cost of ferrous scrap—our primary raw material resulted in a modest 2 increase in steel operations operating income to 5044 million compared to 2012 average 2013 steel prices per ton shipped declined 41 amidst continued pricing pressure while average ferrous scrap consumed for production only declined 25 per ton operating income of omnisource our metals recycling operations decreased 12 to 419 million as 2013 ferrous and nonferrous metals shipments were comparable to 2012 however both ferrous and nonferrous metal margins which we define as the difference between average selling prices and the cost of purchased scrap decreased slightly during the year the impact of losses from our minnesota iron operations on 2013 net income was approximately 42 million or 018 per diluted share in each 

of 2013 and 2012 our steel fabrication operations reported operating income of 70 million in 2013 an increase of 49 million or 231 compared to 2012 experiencing a 24 increase in selling volumes the result of improved domestic demand for fabricated steel as well as our fabrication operations gains in market share 

segment operating results 2013 vs 2012  dollars in thousands  



1 other consists of the results of subsidiary operations that are below the quantitative thresholds required for reportable segments as well as unallocated corporate accounts including profit sharing 



steel operations steel operations consist of our five electric arc furnace minimills producing steel from steel scrap utilizing continuous casting automated rolling mills and various downstream finishing facilities including the techs operations collectively our steel operations sell directly to end users and service centers these products are used in numerous industry sectors including the automotive construction commercial transportation agriculture and industrial machinery markets during 2013 2012 and 2011 our steel operations accounted for 61 62 and 61 respectively of our external net sales operating income for steel operations increased 87 million or 2 to 5044 million in 2013 versus 2012 this increased profitability is due primarily to increased shipping volumes of 5 particularly at our flat roll division and structural and rail division offset partially by a compression of metal margins 

steel operations shipping volumes for the respective periods were as follows 



sheet products our flat roll division sells a broad range of sheet steel products such as hot rolled cold rolled and coated steel products including a large variety of specialty products such as light gauge hot rolled galvanized galvalume® and painted products the techs operations comprised of three galvanizing lines also sells specialized galvanized sheet steels used in nonautomotive applications sheet products represented 63 of our steel segments shipped tons in 2013 as compared to 62 in 2012 and 64 in 2011 

long products our structural and rail division sells structural steel beams pilings a variety of standard strength carbon and intermediate alloy hardness rail for the railroad industry and is also designed to produce and sell premium rail grades our engineered bar products division primarily sells larger diameter special bar quality and merchant bar quality rounds and roundcornered squares and in late 2013 we began commissioning a new rolling mill which will produce precision smallerdiameter round engineered bars our roanoke bar division primarily sells merchant steel products including angles plain rounds flats and channels and billets steel of west virginia primarily sells merchant beams channels and specialty structural steel sections 

net sales for the steel segment increased in 2013 by 669 million or 1 compared to 2012 with the segment achieving record shipments of 61 million tons in 2013 selling volumes increased for both our sheet products 6 and long products 4 in 2013 compared to 2012 and overall product mix between sheet products and long products remained relatively consistent our sheet products operations reported increased shipments in 2013 compared to 2012 with our flat roll division increasing 7 achieving record levels in both shipments and production and experienced improved volumes of valueadded products shipments in 2013 at our structural and rail division increased 14 to a record 12 million tons primarily due to a 43 increase in standard rail shipments as compared to 2012 as the nonresidential construction market continued its slow recovery we saw a 10 improvement in sales of beam products at our structural and rail division in 2013 as compared to 2012 in addition to the increase in rail shipments residential construction continues to improve domestically which is positive for the nonresidential construction industry as it is a leading indicator for the sector 

our 2013 average steel operations segment selling price per ton shipped including intracompany shipments decreased 41 compared with 2012 sheet products 2013 average selling price per ton 

shipped decreased 34 compared with 2012 and long products average selling prices decreased 50 per ton compared with 2012 

steel operations average selling prices and volumes 

metallic raw materials used in our electric arc furnaces represent our single most significant manufacturing cost our metallic raw material cost per net ton consumed in our steel operations decreased 25 in 2013 compared with 2012 during 2013 2012 and 2011 respectively our metallic raw material costs represented 65 66 and 68 of our steel operations manufacturing costs excluding the operations of the techs which purchases rather than produces the steel it further processes 



metals recycling and ferrous resources operations this operating segment primarily includes our metals recycling operations omnisource our liquid pig iron production facility iron dynamics idi and our minnesota iron operations our metals recycling and ferrous resources operations segment accounted for 32 32 and 35 of our external net sales in 2013 2012 and 2011 respectively operating income for the metals recycling and ferrous resources operations segment decreased 160 million in 2013 to a loss of 525 million 

metals recycling and ferrous resources shipping volumes during the respective periods were as follows 



metals recycling our metals recycling operations omnisource represent our metals sourcing and processing operations and are the most significant source of revenues and earnings in this segment these operations sell ferrous scrap to steel mills and foundries and nonferrous scrap such as copper brass aluminum and stainless steel to among others ingot manufacturers copper refineries and mills smelters and specialty mills our metals recycling operations represented 91 94 and 95 of this segments net sales during 2013 2012 and 2011 and 419 million 477 million and 664 million of this segments operating income for these same periods respectively 

during 2013 metals recycling recorded sales of 33 billion on shipments of 55 million gross tons of ferrous metals and 105 billion pounds of nonferrous metals compared with sales of 34 billion on shipments of 56 million gross tons of ferrous and 105 billion pounds of nonferrous metals during 2012 sales prices of ferrous metals decreased 4 in 2013 versus 2012 while sales prices of nonferrous metals were relatively steady year over year during 2013 the metals recycling operations provided approximately 45 of the steel scrap purchased by our steel mills this represented 44 of the metals recycling operations ferrous shipments for 2013 as compared to 46 for 2012 and 43 for 2011 

metals recycling operating income decreased 58 million to 419 million in 2013 as compared to 2012 due to slightly lower ferrous selling volumes and slightly compressed metal margins slightly lower selling prices equated to lower metal margins in 2013 however these reductions were partially offset by reductions in our operating costs the ongoing overcapacity of recycled 

shredding locations particularly in the southeast united states continues to constrain metal margins and thus profitability in spite of increasing steel mill utilization 

ferrous resources our ferrous resource operations consist of our two ironmaking initiatives iron dynamics idi a liquid pig iron production facility and our minnesota iron operations consisting of an iron nugget production facility and operations to supply the nugget facility with its primary raw material iron concentrate idi primarily produces liquid pig iron which is used as a scrap substitute raw material input exclusively at our flat roll division our minnesota iron operations consists of mesabi nugget owned 81 by us our potential future iron mining operations mesabi mining and our iron tailings operations mining resources owned 80 by us the impact of losses from our minnesota iron operations on 2013 net income was approximately 42 million or 018 per diluted share in each of 2013 and 2012 the iron nugget production facility utilizes a pioneering production process which from time to time has experienced operational quality control and production cost challenges the facility commenced initial production of iron nuggets in 2010 we have continued to modify reengineer and further refine this production process and have changed or modified equipment configurations with resulting increases in plant availability increased production and improved quality during the fourth quarter of 2013 we focused on the reduction of production costs and the improvement of product yield certain meaningful adjunct trials that began in the latter half of the fourth quarter have continued into 2014 with some encouraging results however toward the end of the first quarter of 2014 we expect that we will be able to assess whether or to what extent further process improvements if any are justifiable in 2013 2012 and 2011 mesabi nugget produced 214000 178000 and 156000 metric tons of ironnuggets respectively for use by our own steel mills our mining resources operation which supplies the nugget production facility with its primary raw material iron concentrate started operations in 2012 and effectively ramped up operations in 2013 producing 407000 and 56000 metric tons of iron tailings during 2013 and 2012 respectively 



our steel fabrication operations represent the companys new millennium building systems plants located throughout the united states and northern mexico revenues from these plants are generated from the fabrication of trusses girders steel joists and steel decking used within the nonresidential construction industry steel fabrication operations accounted for 6 5 and 3 of our external net sales during 2013 2012 and 2011 respectively operating income for the segment improved to 70 million in 2013 compared to 21 million in 2012 with the increase year over year due principally to increased selling volumes 

net sales for the segment increased by 682 million or 18 in 2013 compared to 2012 as our selling volumes increased 24 to 367000 tons in 2013 while our average steel fabrication operations selling price per ton shipped decreased 59 or 5 in 2013 as compared to 2012 our volume growth can be attributed to continued improvement within the nonresidential construction market as a whole our organic gains in market share as well as our increasing utilization of our assets in the south and southwestern united states residential construction has improved domestically which is also positive for the nonresidential construction industry as it is a leading indicator for the sector fabricated steel consumption in the united states improved during 2013 with estimated domestic joist shipments increasing 14 when compared to 2012 

the purchase of various steel products is the largest single cost of goods sold item for our steel fabrication operations during 2013 the cost of steel products purchased represented 71 of the total cost of manufacturing for our steel fabrication operations compared to 72 in 2012 while the cost of steel decreased in 2013 as compared to 2012 by 54 per ton as the decrease in selling prices of 59 per ton outpaced the decrease in steel input costs of 54 per ton our metal spread was reduced this reduction in metal spread was however offset fully by reduced operating costs 

steel fabrication operations average selling prices and volumes 

consolidated results 2013 vs 2012 

selling general and administrative expense sga selling general and administrative expenses including profit sharing and amortization of intangible assets were 3323 million during 2013 as compared to 3205 million during 2012 an increase of 118 million or 4 during 2013 and 2012 selling general and administrative expenses excluding noncash impairment charges represented approximately 45 and 44 of net sales respectively the increase in sga expenses in 2013 compared to 2012 relates most notably to increased noncash equitybased compensation expenses of 53 million amortization of intangible assets decreased 38 million or 11 during 2013 compared to 2012 due to the accelerated amortization methods used for intangible assets related to customer and scrap generator relationships 

interest expense net of capitalized interest during 2013 gross interest expense decreased 277 million or 17 to 1323 million and capitalized interest increased 32 million to 46 million as compared to 2012 the interest capitalized during these periods relates to longerterm construction activities at our various operating segments which increased in 2013 with our increased expansion plans as compared to 2012 the decrease in gross interest expense is due to refinancing activities that took place in primarily the second half of 2012 and march 2013 we repaid 175 million of our debt in 2012 and 100 million in 2013 we also refinanced 14 billion of senior notes reducing our overall effective interest rate from almost 70 to less than 56 at december 31 2013 

other income expense net other income was 40 million during 2013 as compared to other expense of 285 million during 2012 with interest income of 46 million in 2013 versus 47 million in 2012 we recorded nonoperating charges of 26 million in 2013 related to our 2013 refinancing activities while we recorded 403 million of nonoperating charges in 2012 related to our 2012 refinancing activities 

income taxes during 2013 our income tax expense was 993 million as compared to 618 million during 2012 our effective income tax rate before exclusion of noncontrolling interests was 378 and 303 during 2013 and 2012 respectively the lower effective income tax rate in 2012 is due primarily to the impact of reductions in our unrecognized tax positions due to tax audit settlements in 2012 which reduced our effective tax rate by 96 the 2013 effective tax rate benefitted from the effects of additional stock option exercises during 2013 and 2012 research and development tax credits enacted in january 2013 

included in the balance of unrecognized tax benefits at december 31 2013 of 266 million are potential benefits of 131 million that if recognized would affect the effective tax rate we recognize interest and penalties related to our tax contingencies on a netoftax basis in income tax expense during the year ended december 31 2013 we recognized interest expense of 08 million net of tax in addition to the unrecognized tax benefits noted above we had 74 million accrued for the payment of interest and penalties at december 31 2013 

we file income tax returns in the us federal jurisdiction as well as income tax returns in various state jurisdictions the internal revenue service irs has completed its examinations of the years 2004 through 2009 and has effectively settled those years with us the irs is currently examining our federal income tax returns for the years 2010 and 2011 at this time we do not believe there will be any significant examination adjustments that would result in a material change to our financial position or results of operations it is reasonably possible that the amount of unrecognized tax benefits could change in the next twelve months as a result of these state and federal income tax audits based on the current audits in process the payment of taxes as a result of audit settlements could be in an amount from zero to 137 million by the end of 2014 with few exceptions we are no longer subject to federal state and local income tax examinations by tax authorities for years ended before 2010 

consolidated results 2012 vs 2011 

during 2012 we had net sales of 73 billion gross profit of 7199 million 10 and operating income of 3912 million 5 as compared to net sales of 80 billion gross profit of 9315 million 12 and operating income of 5848 million 7 during 2011 net income attributable to steel dynamics inc was 1636 million or 073 per diluted share in 2012 compared with 2781 million or 122 per diluted share in 2011 

during 2012 operating income declined 33 or 1937 million as compared to 2011 the majority of the decline related to steel operations as operating income for the segment declined 1625 million or 25 year over year the combination of global economic and political uncertainty continued to suppress consumer confidence and dampened global steel demand downward pressure on steel margins arose from a weak us economy resulting in higher raw materials costs on a relative basis to lower selling values caused in part by increased import activity while overall steel volumes remained steady as demand from automotive and manufacturing stayed strong throughout the year and steel conversion costs stayed fairly steady to down metal spread which we define as the difference between average selling prices and the cost of ferrous scrap—our primary raw material compressed average 2012 steel prices per ton shipped externally declined 66 while average ferrous scrap consumed for production only declined 32 per ton 

operating income of our metals recycling and ferrous resources segment decreased in 2012 to a loss of 365 million as compared to income of 266 million in 2011 at omnisource our metals recycling operations within our metals recycling and ferrous resources segment ferrous and nonferrous metals sales volume and pricing decreased as demand weakened compared to 2011 in conjunction with moderate decreases in domestic and international steel mill utilization rates and metal spreads compressed this resulted in margin compression in both ferrous and nonferrous metals that resulted in operating profit at omnisource decreasing 188 million or 28 to 477 million from that of 2011 losses from our minnesota iron operations reduced our net income in 2012 and 2011 by approximately 415 million and 340 million respectively the increased losses in 2012 were due to the continued startup efforts and decreased market selling prices in 2012 as pig iron market prices price index used to determine selling prices decreased in addition our idi operations operating income decreased 174 million or 57 compared to 2011 due to decreased selling prices as pig iron market prices price index used to determine selling prices decreased 

selling general and administrative expense sga selling general and administrative expenses including profit sharing and amortization of intangible assets were 3205 million during 2012 as compared to 3467 million during 2011 a decrease of 262 million or 8 during each of 2012 and 2011 selling general and administrative expenses represented approximately 4 of net sales the decrease in sga expenses in 2012 compared to 2011 relates primarily to decreased profit sharing and incentive compensation expenses in conjunction with our lower profitability during 2012 amortization of intangible assets decreased 44 million or 11 during 2012 compared to 2011 due to the accelerated amortization methods used for intangible assets related to customer and scrap generator relationships 

impairment charges in the third quarter of 2012 we determined that we would terminate two small joint venture entities which were not aligned with our longterm strategic focus the decision to terminate these joint ventures triggered an assessment for impairment based on estimated realizable values resulting in an impairment charge of 83 million being recorded as these joint ventures are not reported within any of our reportable segments reported segment results were not affected 

interest expense net of capitalized interest during 2012 gross interest expense decreased 187 million or 10 to 1600 million and capitalized interest decreased 336000 or 19 to 14 million as compared to 2011 gross interest expense decreased in 2012 as a result of our paying down 175 million in longterm debt primarily in the third quarter of 2012 in conjunction with a refinancing of our longterm debt which also served to reduce our overall cost of debt and extend our overall maturity schedule 

other income expense net other expense was 285 million during 2012 as compared to other income of 165 million during 2011 with interest income of 47 million in 2012 versus 45 million in 2011 the refinancing activity during 2012 resulted in the company recording expenses of 403 million related to tender and call premiums write off of unamortized debt issuance costs loss on early extinguishment of debt and tender expenses which are reflected in other expenses in 2012 

income taxes during 2012 our income tax expense was 618 million as compared to 1586 million during 2011 our effective income tax rate before noncontrolling interests was 303 and 374 during 2012 and 2011 respectively the lower effective income tax rate in 2012 is due primarily to the impact of reductions in our unrecognized tax positions due to tax audit settlements in 2012 which reduced our effective tax rate by 96 this benefit was partially offset by an increase of the negative impact on the effective tax rate of larger noncontrolling interest losses on the lower 2012 pretax income 

liquidity and capital resources 

our business is capital intensive and requires substantial expenditures for among other things the purchase and maintenance of equipment used in our steelmaking and finishing operations and metals recycling and ferrous resources operations and to remain in compliance with environmental laws our shortterm and longterm liquidity needs arise primarily from capital expenditures working capital requirements principal and interest payments related to our outstanding indebtedness and dividends we have met these liquidity requirements with cash provided by operations longterm borrowings and issuances of common stock our availability at december 31 2013 is as follows 



working capital cash flow from operations of 3122 million was driven mainly by net income plus noncash items such as depreciation and amortization deferred taxes and equitybased compensation during 2013 our operational working capital position representing amounts invested in trade receivables and inventories less current liabilities other than income taxes payable and debt increased 1216 million to 14 billion compared to december 31 2012 trade receivables of which over 97 were current or less than 60 days past due increased 782 million or 12 during 2013 to 7206 million trade receivables increased during 2013 due to increased sales levels late in the fourth quarter of 2013 as compared to the fourth quarter of 2012 as days sales outstanding has remained consistent total inventories increased in 2013 by 1122 million or 9 to 13 billion at december 31 2013 scrap inventory increased 610 million in total in 2013 as scrap volumes increased 21 at december 31 2013 compared to december 31 2012 in conjunction with increased production volumes and increased scrap purchases late in 2013 in advance of anticipated price increases in 2014 workinprocess and finished goods inventories increased 312 million with steel volumes increasing 8 in conjunction with increased selling volumes our trade payables increased 548 million or 15 and general accruals increased 140 million during 2013 the increase in trade payables is a reflection of the increased production activities and commodity raw material pricing and purchasing prior to december 31 2013 compared to that at december 31 2012 

capital investments during 2013 we invested 1868 million in property plant and equipment of which 1218 million was within our steel operations including 886 million on the expansion projects at our engineered bar products structural and rail and flat roll divisions and 607 million related to our metals recycling and ferrous resource operations we believe these capital investments will benefit our net sales and related cash flows as each project is completed and attains appropriate operational metrics our current estimated 2014 cash allocation plan includes the investment of between 125 million and 150 million in capital expenditures in our existing and announced operations 

capital resources and longterm debt during 2013 our total outstanding debt decreased 946 million to 21 billion as we reduced our outstanding senior notes by 1000 million through refinancing initiatives in 2013 discussed below our total longterm debt to capitalization ratio representing our longterm debt including current maturities divided by the sum of our longterm debt redeemable noncontrolling interest and total stockholders equity was 447 at december 31 2013 as compared to 471 at december 31 2012 

in march 2013 we issued 4000 million of 5 1  4  senior notes due 2023 2023 notes the proceeds from the issuance of the 2023 notes was used along with available cash to purchase pursuant to a tender offer and repay the 5000 million outstanding 6 3  4  senior notes due 2015 as a result of this refinancing activity our overall outstanding debt decreased 1000 million we further extended and laddered our debt maturities and we reduced our overall effective interest rate 

we have a senior secured credit facility facility which provides for a 11 billion revolver revolver which matures in september 2016 subject to certain conditions we have the opportunity to increase the revolver capacity by an additional 1250 million the facility is guaranteed by certain of our subsidiaries and is secured by substantially all of our accounts receivable and inventories and pledges of shares of our wholly owned subsidiaries capital stock the revolver is available to fund working capital capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes 

the outstanding balance on the revolver must be the lesser of 11 billion less other applicable commitments such as letters of credit and other secured debt as defined within the facility or the sum of 85 of our eligible accounts receivable and 65 of our eligible inventories less other applicable commitments at december 31 2013 we had 11 billion of availability on the revolver 138 million of outstanding letters of credit and other obligations which reduce availability and there were no outstanding borrowings 

the facility contains financial covenants and other covenants pertaining to our ability to make capital expenditures incur indebtedness permit liens on property enter into transactions with affiliates make restricted payments or investments enter into mergers acquisitions or consolidations conduct asset sales pay dividends or distributions and enter into other specified transactions and activities our ability to borrow funds within the terms of the revolver is dependent upon our continued compliance with the financial and other covenants 

the financial covenants under our facility state that we must maintain an interest coverage ratio of not less than 250100 our interest coverage ratio is calculated by dividing our lasttwelve trailing months ltm consolidated adjusted ebitda earnings before interest taxes depreciation amortization and certain other noncash transactions as allowed in our facility by our ltm gross interest expense less amortization of financing fees in addition a net debt as defined in the facility to consolidated ltm adjusted ebitda ratio leverage ratio of not more than 500100 must be maintained if the leverage ratio exceeds 350100 at any time our ability to make restricted payments as defined in the credit agreement which includes cash dividends to stockholders and share purchases among other things is limited at december 31 2013 our interest coverage ratio and net debt leverage ratio were 530100 and 260100 respectively we were therefore in compliance with these covenants at december 31 2013 and we anticipate we will continue to be in compliance during the next twelve months 

cash dividends we declared cash dividends of 974 million or 044 per common share 011 per common share each quarter during 2013 and 877 million or 040 per common share 010 per common share per quarter during 2012 we paid cash dividends of 948 million and 876 million during 2013 and 2012 respectively our board of directors along with executive management approves the payment of dividends on a quarterly basis the determination to pay cash dividends in the future will be at the discretion of our board of directors after taking into account various factors including our financial condition results of operations outstanding indebtedness current and anticipated cash needs and growth plans in addition the terms of our senior secured revolving credit agreement and the indentures relating to our senior notes limit the amount of cash dividends we can pay 

other our ability to meet our debt service obligations and reduce our total debt will depend upon our future performance which in turn will depend upon general economic financial and business conditions along with competition legislation and regulatory factors that are largely beyond our control in addition we cannot assure you that our operating results cash flow access to credit markets and capital resources will be sufficient for repayment of our indebtedness in the future we believe that based upon current levels of operations and anticipated growth cash flow from operations together with other available sources of funds including additional borrowings under our senior secured credit facility through its term which expires in september 2016 will be adequate for the next twelve months for making required payments of principal and interest on our indebtedness funding working capital requirements and anticipated capital expenditures 

during 2013 we received benefits from state and local governments in the form of real estate and personal property tax abatements and credits of approximately 54 million based on our current abatements and incentive credits and utilizing our existing longlived asset structure we estimate the remaining annual benefit to our future operations to be approximately 38 million 30 million 970000 700000 and 430000 during the years 2014 through 2018 respectively and 390000 in total thereafter 

contractual obligations and other longterm liabilities 

we have the following minimum commitments under contractual obligations including purchase obligations as defined by the us securities and exchange commission a purchase obligation is defined as an agreement to purchase goods or services that is enforceable and legally binding and that specifies all significant terms including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased fixed minimum or variable price provisions and the approximate timing of the transaction other longterm liabilities are defined as longterm liabilities that are reflected on our balance sheet under generally accepted accounting principles based on this definition the following table includes only those contracts which include fixed or minimum obligations it does not include normal purchases which are made in the ordinary course of business the following table provides aggregated information about outstanding contractual obligations and other longterm liabilities as of december 31 2013 in thousands 



1 the longterm debt payment information presented above assumes that our term loan senior notes and convertible senior notes remain outstanding until maturity refer to note 2 to the consolidated financial statements elsewhere in this report for additional information regarding these transactions and our longterm debt 2 the estimated interest payments shown above assume interest rates of 18 variable rate at december 31 2013 on the 2475 million term loan issued january 2012 maturing in september 2016 5125 on our 2875 million convertible senior notes due june 2014 6 1  8  on our 4000 million senior unsecured notes due august 2019 7 5  8  on our 3500 million senior unsecured notes due march 2020 6 3  8  on our 3500 million senior unsecured notes due august 2022 5 1  4  on our 4000 million senior unsecured notes due march 2023 035 commitment fee on our available senior secured revolver and an average of 48 on our other debt of 726 million 3 purchase obligations include commitments we have for the purchase of electricity natural gas and its transportation fuel air products and zinc these arrangements have take or pay or other similar commitment provisions we have utilized such take or pay requirements during the past three years under these contracts 4 construction commitments relate to firm contracts we have with various vendors for the completion of certain construction projects at our various divisions at december 31 2013 5 other commitments principally relate to certain pension and deferred compensation plan obligations 6 we expect to make cash outlays in the future related to our unrecognized tax benefits however due to the uncertainty of the timing we are unable to make reasonably reliable estimates regarding the period of cash settlement with the respective taxing authorities accordingly unrecognized tax benefits and related interest and penalties of 340 million as of december 31 

2013 have been excluded from the contractual obligations table above refer to note 3 to the consolidated financial statements elsewhere in this report for additional information 

other matters 

inflation 

we believe that inflation has not had a material effect on our results of operations 

environmental and other contingencies 

we have incurred and in the future will continue to incur capital expenditures and operating expenses for matters relating to environmental control remediation monitoring and compliance during 2013 we incurred costs related to the monitoring and compliance of environmental matters in the amount of approximately 376 million and capital expenditures related to environmental compliance of approximately 14 million over 78 of the costs incurred during 2013 for monitoring and compliance were related to the normal transportation of certain types of waste produced in the steelmaking process in accordance with legal requirements we incurred combined environmental remediation costs of approximately 629000 at all of our facilities during 2013 we have an accrual of 18 million net of 746000 of escrowed funds recorded for environmental remediation related to our metals recycling operations and 28 million related to minnesota operations we believe apart from our dependence on environmental construction and operating permits for our existing and any future manufacturing facilities that compliance with current environmental laws and regulations is not likely to have a materially adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or liquidity however environmental laws and regulations have changed rapidly in recent years and we may become subject to more stringent environmental laws and regulations in the future such as the impact of united states government or various governmental agencies introducing regulatory changes in response to the potential of climate change 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

managements discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states we review the accounting policies we use in reporting our financial results on a regular basis the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent liabilities we evaluate the appropriateness of these estimations and judgments on an ongoing basis we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources results may differ from these estimates due to actual outcomes being different from those on which we based our assumptions we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 

revenue recognition and allowance for doubtful accounts except for our steel fabrication operations segment we recognize revenues from sales and the allowance for estimated returns from these sales when the title of the product transfers provision is made for estimated product returns and customer claims based on historical experience if the historical data used in our estimates does not reflect future returns and claims trends additional provision may be necessary the allowance for doubtful accounts is based on the companys best estimate of probably credit losses along with historical experience which estimates may or may not prove accurate our steel fabrication operations segment recognizes revenues from construction contracts using a percentageofcompletion 

methodology based on steel tons used on completed units todate as a percentage of estimated total steel tons required by each contract 

we are exposed to credit risk in the event of nonpayment by our customers which in steel operations are principally intermediate steel processors and service centers that sell our products to numerous industry sectors including the automotive agriculture construction commercial transportation energy and industrial machinery markets our metals recycling operations sell ferrous scrap to steel mills and foundries and nonferrous scrap such as copper brass aluminum and stainless steel to among others ingot manufacturers copper refineries and mills smelters and specialty mills we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments based on known credit risks historical loss experience and current economic conditions affecting our customers we mitigate our exposure to credit risk by performing ongoing credit evaluations and taking further action when necessary such as requiring letters of credit or other security interests to support the receivable from our customer if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate resulting in the impairment of their ability to make payments additional allowance may be required 

inventories we record inventories at lower of cost or market cost is determined using a weighted average cost method for scrap and on a firstin firstout basis for other inventory we record amounts required if any to reduce the carrying value of inventory to its net realizable value as a charge to cost of goods sold if steel selling prices were to decline in future periods writedown of inventory could result specifically raw material inventory such as scrap purchased during periods of peak market pricing 

impairments of longlived tangible and finitelived intangible assets we review longlived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable impairment losses are recorded on longlived assets used in operations when indicators of impairment are present and the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than the assets carrying amounts the impairment loss is measured by comparing the fair value of the asset to its carrying amount we consider various factors and determine whether an impairment test is necessary including by way of examples a significant and prolonged deterioration in operating results and projected cash flows significant changes in the extent or manner in which an asset is used technological advances with respect to assets which would potentially render them obsolete our strategy and capital planning and the economic climate in markets to be served when determining future cash flows and if necessary fair value we must make judgments as to the expected utilization of assets and estimated future cash flows related to those assets we consider historical and anticipated future results general economic and market conditions the impact of planned business and operational strategies and all other available information at the time the estimates are made those estimates and judgments may or may not ultimately prove appropriate 

in the third quarter of 2012 we terminated two small joint venture entities which were not aligned with our longterm strategic focus the decision to terminate these joint ventures triggered an assessment for impairment based on estimated realizable values resulting in an impairment charge of 83 million being recorded as these joint ventures are not reported within any of our reportable segments reported segment results were not affected 

goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets 

our goodwill relates to various business combinations and is allocated to the following reporting units at december 31in thousands 



at least once annually or when indicators of impairment exist we perform an impairment test for goodwill goodwill is allocated to various reporting units which are generally one level below our operating segments we utilize a twostepped approach to measuring goodwill impairment the first step of the test determines if there is potential goodwill impairment in this step we compare the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying amount which includes goodwill the fair value of the reporting unit is determined by using an estimate of future cash flows utilizing a riskadjusted discount rate to calculate the net present value of future cash flows income approach and by using a market approach based upon an analysis of valuation metrics of comparable peer companies if the carrying amount exceeds the fair value we perform the second step of the test which measures the amount of impairment loss to be recorded if any in the second step we compare the carrying amount of the goodwill to the implied fair value of the goodwill based on the net fair value of the recognized and unrecognized assets and liabilities of the reporting unit if the implied fair value is less than the carrying value an impairment loss is recorded to the extent that the fair value of the goodwill is less than its carrying value 

key assumptions used to determine the estimated fair value of each reporting unit under the discounted cash flows method income approach include a expected cash flows for the fiveyear period following the testing date including market share sales volumes and prices costs to produce and estimated capital needs b an estimated terminal value using a terminal year growth rate determined based on the growth prospects of the reporting unit and c a riskadjusted discount rate based on managements best estimate of market participants aftertax weighted average cost of capital and market risk premiums key assumptions used to determine the estimated fair value of each reporting unit under the market approach include the expected revenues and cash flows in the next year we consider historical and anticipated future results general economic and market conditions the impact of planned business and operational strategies and all available information at the time the fair values of its reporting units are estimated those estimates and judgments may or may not ultimately prove appropriate 

goodwill and other intangible assets acquired in more recent transactions are naturally more susceptible to impairment primarily due to the fact that they are recorded at fair value based on operating plans and economic conditions present at the time of acquisition consequently if operating results andor economic conditions deteriorate after an acquisition it could result in the impairment of the acquired assets a deterioration of economic conditions may not only negatively impact the estimated operating cash flows used in our cash flow models but may also negatively impact other assumptions used in our analyses including but not limited to the estimated cost of capital andor discount rates additionally we are required to ensure that assumptions used to determine fair value in our analyses are consistent with the assumptions a hypothetical marketplace participant would use as a result the cost of capital andor discount rates used in our analyses may increase or decrease based on market conditions and trends regardless of whether our actual cost of capital has changed therefore 

we may recognize an impairment of an intangible asset or assets in spite of realizing actual cash flows that are approximately equal to or greater than our previously forecasted amounts 

our other indefinitelived intangible assets relate to trademarks acquired through various business combinations and is allocated to the following reporting units at december 31 2013 and 2012 in thousands 



at least annually or when indicators of impairment exist we perform an impairment test for indefinitelived intangible assets through the comparison of the fair value of the specific intangible asset with its carrying amount the fair value of the intangible asset is determined by using an estimate of future cash flows attributable to the asset and a riskadjusted discount rate to compute a net present value of future cash flows if the fair value is less than the carrying value an impairment loss is recorded in an amount equal to the excess in carrying value 

our fourth quarter 2013 annual goodwill and indefinitelived intangible asset impairment analyses did not result in any impairment charges management does not believe that it is reasonably likely that our reporting units will fail step one of a goodwill impairment test in the near term the most significant portion of our goodwill relates to the omnisource reporting unit the fair value of omnisource exceeded its carrying value by approximately 26 however our analysis contemplates growth in overall scrap consumption and thus our sales volumes and metal margins based on economic and industry forecasts and some planned organic growth and cost containment activities while management believes these assumptions are reasonable and their use appropriate actual results may not meet forecasted results a 20 decrease in forecasted cash flows would not result in a failure of step 1 for the omnisource reporting unit the riskadjusted discount rate used in the analysis is also a critical assumption one in which a minor change can have a significant impact on the estimated fair value a more than 250 basis point increase in the 120 riskadjusted discount rate used in the omnisource analysis would not result in a failure of step 1 for the reporting unit we will continue to monitor operating results within all reporting units throughout the upcoming year in an effort to determine if events and circumstances warrant further interim impairment testing otherwise all reporting units will again be subject to the required annual impairment test during the fourth quarter of 2014 changes in judgments and estimates underlying our analysis of goodwill for possible impairment including expected future operating cash flows and discount rate could decrease the estimated fair value of our reporting units in the future and could result in an impairment of goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets 

income taxes we are required to estimate our income taxes as a part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements this requires us to estimate our actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatments of items for tax and accounting purposes these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities which are included within our consolidated balance sheet we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely we must establish a valuation allowance we establish reserves to reduce some or all of the tax benefit of any of our tax positions at the time we determine that the positions become uncertain we adjust these reserves including any impact on the related interest and penalties in light of changing facts and circumstances such as the progress of a tax audit a number of years may elapse before a particular matter for which we have established a reserve is audited by a taxing authority and finally resolved the number of years with open tax audits varies depending on the tax jurisdiction the tax benefit that has been previously reserved because of a failure to meet the more likely than not recognition threshold would be recognized in our income tax expense in the first interim period when the uncertainty disappears settlement of any particular issue would usually require the use of cash 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

market risk 

in the normal course of business we are exposed to interest rate changes our objectives in managing exposure to interest rate changes are to limit the impact of these rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower overall borrowing costs to achieve these objectives we primarily use interest rate swaps to manage net exposure to interest rate changes related to our portfolio of borrowings 

the following table represents the principal cash repayments and related weightedaverage interest rates by maturity date for our longterm debt as of december 31 2013 in thousands 



commodity risk 

in the normal course of business we are exposed to the market risk and price fluctuations related to the sale of our products and to the purchase of raw materials used in our operations such as metallic raw materials electricity natural gas air products fuel and zinc our risk strategy associated with product sales has generally been to obtain competitive prices for our products and to allow operating results to reflect market price movements dictated by supply and demand 

our risk strategy associated with the purchase of raw materials utilized within our operations has generally been to make some commitments with suppliers relating to future expected requirements for some commodities such as electricity natural gas and its transportation services air products fuel and zinc certain of these commitments contain provisions which require us to take or pay for specified quantities without regard to actual usage for periods of up to 46 months for physical commodity requirements for up to 7 years for commodity transportation requirements and for up to 14 years for air products our commitments for these arrangements with take or pay or other similar commitment provisions for the years ending december 31 are as follows in thousands 



we utilized such take or pay requirements during the past three years under these contracts we believe that production requirements will be such that consumption of the products or services purchased under these commitments will occur in the normal production process we also purchase electricity consumed at our flat roll division pursuant to a contract which extends through december 2014 the contract designates 160 hours annually as interruptible service and establishes an agreed fixedrate energy charge per millkwh consumed for each year through the expiration of the agreement 

in our metals recycling operations we have certain fixed price contracts with various customers and suppliers for future delivery of nonferrous metals our risk strategy has been to enter into base metal financial contracts with the goal to protect the profit margin within certain parameters that was contemplated when we entered into the transaction with the customer or vendor at december 31 2013 we had a cumulative unrealized loss associated with these financial contracts of 35 million substantially all of which have a settlement date in 2014 we believe the customer contracts associated with the financial contracts will be fully consummated

 item 1 business 

our company 

we are one of the largest steel producers and one of the largest metals recyclers in the united states based on a current estimated annual steelmaking capability of 64 million tons and actual recycling volumes actual metals recycling shipments during 2012 2011 and 2010 respectively were 56 million gross tons 59 million gross tons and 52 million gross tons of ferrous materials and 11 billion pounds 11 billion pounds and 961 million pounds of nonferrous metallics our steel shipments during 2012 2011 and 2010 were 58 million tons 58 million tons and 53 million tons respectively we reported net sales of 73 billion 80 billion and 63 billion during 2012 2011 and 2010 respectively at december 31 2012 we employed approximately 6670 individuals 90 of whom were nonunion 

steel dynamics inc was incorporated in indiana in august 1993 our principal executive offices are located at 7575 w jefferson boulevard fort wayne indiana 46804 and our telephone number is 2609693500 

the primary sources of our revenues are from the manufacture and sale of steel products processing and sale of recycled ferrous and nonferrous metals and to a lesser degree fabrication and sale of steel joist and decking products our operations are managed and reported based on three operating segments steel operations metals recycling and ferrous resources operations and steel fabrication operations 

steel operations steel operations consist of our five electricarc furnace minimills producing steel from steel scrap utilizing continuous casting automated rolling mills and various downstream finishing facilities our steel operations accounted for 62 61 and 61 of our consolidated net sales in 2012 2011 and 2010 respectively collectively our steel operations sell directly to end users and service centers these products are used in numerous industry sectors including the automotive agriculture energy construction commercial transportation and industrial machinery markets 

sheet products our flat roll division sells a broad range of sheet steel products such as hot rolled cold rolled and coated steel products including a large variety of specialty products such as light gauge hot rolled galvanized galvalume® and painted products the techs operations comprised of three galvanizing lines also sells specialized galvanized sheet steels used in nonautomotive applications our sheet operations represented 57 60 and 63 of this segments net sales in 2012 2011 and 2010 respectively 

long products our structural and rail division sells structural steel beams and pilings and a variety of standard strength and industrial quality grade rail for the railroad industry our engineered bar products division primarily sells special bar quality and merchant bar quality rounds and roundcornered squares our roanoke bar division sells billets and merchant steel products including angles plain rounds flats and channels steel of west virginia primarily sells merchant beams channels and specialty structural steel sections 

metals recycling and ferrous resources operations this operating segment primarily includes our metals recycling operations liquid pig iron production facility and minnesota iron operations our metals recycling and ferrous resources operations accounted for 32 35 and 35 of our consolidated net sales in 2012 2011 and 2010 respectively 

metals recycling our metals recycling operations represent our metals sourcing and processing operations and are the most significant source of income in this segment our metals recycling operations sell ferrous metals to steel mills and foundries and nonferrous metals such as copper brass aluminum and stainless steel to ingot manufacturers copper refineries and mills smelters and specialty mills our metals recycling operations represented 94 95 and 96 of this segments net sales during 2012 2011 and 2010 respectively our metals recycling operations also sell ferrous metals to our own steel mills as a raw material these shipments to our steel mills represented 46 43 and 42 of our metals recycling ferrous shipped tons in 2012 2011 and 2010 respectively 

ferrous resources our ferrous resource operations consist of our two ironmaking initiatives iron dynamics idi a liquid pig iron production facility and our minnesota iron operations consisting of an iron nugget production facility and planned operations to supply the nugget facility with its primary raw material iron concentrate idi primarily produces liquid pig iron which is used as a scrap substitute raw material input exclusively at our flat roll division our minnesota iron operations consists of mesabi nugget owned 81 by us our planned future iron mining operations which is currently in the permitting process mesabi mining and our iron tailings operations mining resources owned 80 by us the construction of the mesabi nugget facility 

was completed in 2009 and initial production of iron nuggets commenced january 2010 since that time we have refined this pioneering production process and changed equipment configurations to increase production and plant availability the facilitys designed annual production capacity is 500000 metric tons in 2012 2011 and 2010 mesabi nugget produced and shipped 169000 160000 and 67000 metric tons of ironnuggets respectively for use by our own steel mills our iron tailings operation mining resources started operations in the fourth quarter of 2012 and expects to be at full capacity during the first half of 2013 this operation provides iron ore tailings to be concentrated for use by mesabi nugget as a lowcost iron concentrate to the nugget production process 

steel fabrication operations our steel fabrication operations include six new millennium building systems plants which fabricate steel joists trusses girders and decking used within the nonresidential construction industry steel fabrication operations accounted for 5 3 and 3 of our consolidated net sales in 2012 2011 and 2010 respectively 

competitive strengths  business strategies 

we believe our financial strategy coupled with our competitive advantages of maintaining a low highly variable cost structure producing a diversified valueadded product offering controlling a secure supply of recycled ferrous metals fostering an entitywide entrepreneurial culture and having an experienced senior management team positions us well to continue to strengthen our leadership position during the economic recovery 

one of the lowest cost steel producers in the united states stateoftheart facilities  continue to maintain low production costs 

we are focused on continuing to maintain and enhance one of the lowest operating cost structures in the north american steel industry our low operating costs are primarily a result of our efficient plant designs and operations our high productivity rate such as our productivity rate of approximately 3 man hours per hot band ton produced at our flat roll divisions mill low ongoing maintenance cost requirements and strategic locations near our customers and sources of our primary raw material steel scrap 

we will continue to strive to optimize the use of our equipment enhance our productivity and explore new technologies to further improve our unit costs of production at each of our facilities we believe that as one of the lowest cost producers in each of our primary operating segments we are able to better manage through cyclical and noncyclical downturns and to consistently maximize our profitability we continuously seek to maximize the variability of our cost structure and to reduce per unit and fixed costs our incentive compensation plans at all employee levels are based on both divisional and consolidated company performance incentive compensation is designed to reward high productivity and efficient use of physical resources and capital employed 

secure supply of ferrous raw materials  develop metals recycling and ferrous resources business platform 

we maintain a secure supply of ferrous raw material resources through the benefit of our metals recycling operations as well as through our current ironmaking facilities ferrous materials represent our singlelargest component of our steel operations total manufacturing costs excluding the techs representing 66 and 68 of such costs in 2012 and 2011 respectively during 2012 and 2011 our metals recycling operations provided our steel operations with 51 and 52 respectively of its ferrous scrap requirements based on volume during both 2012 and 2011 we consumed 60 million tons of metallic materials in our steel making furnaces of which iron units other than scrap represented approximately 8 and 7 respectively our ironmaking operations internally supplied 90 and 87 

of these iron units in 2012 and 2011 respectively through the transfer of liquid pig iron hot briquetted iron and iron nuggets which are higherquality energysaving ferrous raw materials 

we expect domestic and global demand for steel products to continue to increase and we believe there may be supply constraints of various commodities including ferrous materials during periods of economic downturn significant reductions in available prime industrial scrap are a direct result of lower domestic manufacturing rates additionally as consumers utilize assets for longer periods of time and replace items less frequently the flow of other sources of scrap such as auto bodies appliances and other goods is also constrained the world demand for domestic ferrous resources has increased in nearly every year in the past decade impacting scrap availability as exports increase to developing countries 

we believe our metals recycling and ferrous resources operations not only provide us with a quality cost effective and secure raw material platform but we also believe it provides us with significant revenue generating and profitability opportunities that allow for funding of future growth whether in ferrous resources or in other ventures we intend to continue to participate in the development of new technologies to increase the effectiveness of our metals recycling recovery capabilities and to consider new strategic relationships in order to increase the amount of unprocessed metals we have the ability to source and eventually sell 

diversified product mix  expand product offerings 

our current products in our steel segment include hot rolled cold rolled galvanized galvalume® and painted sheet steel various structural steel beams and rails special bar quality steel and various merchant steel products including beams angles flats and channels in addition we offer steel finishing and fabrication services in the metals recycling operations of our metals recycling and ferrous resources segment our products include an array of both ferrous and nonferrous scrap processing scrap management transportation and brokerage products and services finally our steel fabrication segment produces steel joists and steel decking materials this diversified mix of products enables us to access a broad range of enduser markets serve a broad customer base and helps mitigate our market exposure to any one product or enduser market in addition our valueadded product offerings help to balance our exposure to commodity grade products 

we will continue to seek additional opportunities to further expand our range of products whether through the expansion of existing facilities such as the expansion at our engineered bar products division into highquality smalldiameter sbq bars or the expansion at our structural and rail division into carbon steel and headhardened rails greenfield projects or acquisitions or ventures that may become available in both the domestic steel and recycling industries maximization of our minnesota iron operations as well as the expansions and upgrades of existing facilities are further important steps in pursuing our strategy of secure raw material sourcing and product line expansion 

strategic geographic locations  enter new geographic markets 

the locations of our steelmaking facilities near sources of scrap materials and near our customer base allow us to realize freight savings for inbound scrap as well as for outbound steel products destined for our customers recycled steel scrap and iron units represent the most significant component of our cost of steel manufacturing our metals recycling facilities are located in the upper midwest and southeastern united states and thus further expand our geographic service area we believe these regions account for a majority of the total steel scrap produced in the united states our coated sheet steel products are also more cost effectively available through our locations in pittsburgh pennsylvania and jeffersonville indiana due to river access in october 2010 we purchased certain joist assets from another manufacturer including three plants located in arkansas nevada and northern mexico which along with our locations in the midwest and southeast provides us with a national footprint allowing us to serve the entire joist and deck domestic market and national accounts 

we may seek to enter new markets in strategic geographic locations that offer attractive growth opportunities 

experienced management team and unique corporate culture  foster entrepreneurial culture 

our senior management team is highly experienced and has a proven track record in the steel and metals recycling industries managements objectives are closely aligned with our stockholders through meaningful stock ownership positions and performancebased compensation programs that are correlated to the companys profitability our corporate culture is also unique for all of our operating segments we emphasize decentralized decisionmaking and have established incentive compensation programs specifically designed to reward employee teams for their efforts toward enhancing productivity improving profitability and controlling costs 

we intend to continue to foster our entrepreneurial corporate culture and emphasize decentralized decision making and responsibility while rewarding teamwork innovation and operating efficiency we will also continue to focus on maintaining the effectiveness of our incentivebased bonus plans that are designed to enhance overall productivity and align the interests of our management and employees with our stockholders 

industry segments 

we have three reporting segments steel operations metals recycling and ferrous resources operations and steel fabrication operations please refer to item 8  consolidated financial statements and supplementary data for additional information 

steel operations 

our steel operations segment consists of steelmaking and coating operations the following chart summarizes the locations and the current capacities of our facilities 





1 rolling capacity expected to increase to 950000 tons by end of 2013 from the expansion project currently in process 

2 rolling capacity expected to increase to 355000 tons in the first half of 2013 due to equipment enhancements currently in process 

note capacities represent manufacturing capabilities based on mill configuration and related employee support these capacities do not represent expected volumes in a given year in addition estimates of mill capacity particularly rolling capacity are highly dependent on the specific product mix manufactured each of our mills can and do roll many different types and sizes of products therefore our capacity estimates assume a typical product mix 

sheet products 

our sheet steel products are produced by both our flat roll division which consists of our flat roll mill galvanizing and painting facilities in butler indiana our galvanizing and painting facilities in jeffersonville indiana and the techs our pittsburgh pennsylvaniabased galvanizing company which operates three galvanizing facilities galvtech metaltech and nextech 

our flat roll mill manufactures flat rolled hot rolled cold rolled and coated steel products we produced 28 million tons and 29 million tons at this facility in 2012 and 2011 respectively our products are characterized by high quality surface characteristics precise tolerances and light gauge in addition this mill has achieved iso 90012008—ansiisoasq q90012008 certification we believe that these certifications have enabled us to serve a broad range of customers who may require certifications for themselves or to satisfy the endusers of our steel products 

our flat roll mill has two twinshell electric arc furnaces which enable us to melt scrap in one vessel while tapping the other vessel and refilling it with steel scrap and iron units to make it ready for the next heat this results in more heats and greater productivity we have three ladle metallurgy stations two continuous thinslab casters and two tunnel furnaces our hot rolling mill which progressively reduces the slab in thickness consists of a sevenstand rolling mill capable of rolling sheet steel down to 10 mm with excellent surface quality which enables us to access markets previously available only to more expensive cold finished material 

located within our flat roll mill we have a hot rolled galvanizing line capable of coating steel in gauges from 044 to 160 inches and in widths ranging from 40 to 61 inches also within our flat roll mill we have a cold rolled galvanizing line capable of coating steel in gauges from 012 to 070 inches and in widths ranging from 40 to 61 inches our onsite paint line receives material directly from our other processing lines and is capable of painting hot rolled galvanized coil cold rolled coil and cold rolled galvanized coil in gauges of 012 to 070 inches and in widths ranging from 40 to 61 inches we believe this enables us to realize substantial savings in the production of painted coil and pass along savings and efficiencies to our customers when compared to remote offsite coating facilities 

in jeffersonville indiana we have a cold rolled galvanizing facility located within the clark maritime centre on the ohio river this facility is capable of coating cold rolled steel in gauges from 012 to 040 inches and in widths between 40 and 61 inches this gauge range is lighter than that available from our butler facility and creates further expansion of our value added product offerings our flat roll mill provides our jeffersonville facility with cold rolled material 

the techs facilities produced 657000 tons and 713000 tons in 2012 and 2011 respectively the techs facilities have galvanizing lines with varying capabilities nextech is capable of coating cold rolled steel in gauges from 007 to 020 inches and in widths between 24 and 43 inches galvtech is capable of coating cold rolled steel in gauges from 012 to 040 inches and in widths between 30 and 60 inches metaltech is capable of coating cold rolled steel in gauges from 015 to 160 inches and in widths between 24 and 52 inches in addition to third party steel producers our flat roll division provides the techs with required steel material the techs has achieved the iso 90012008—ansiisoasq q90012008 certification 

the following table summarizes the types of sheet products we sold during the respective years 



hot rolled products our flat roll mill produces hot rolled products that include a variety of high quality low and medium carbon and highstrength lowalloy hot rolled bands in widths from 40 to 62 inches and in thicknesses from 375 inches down to 042 inches we also produce an array of lighter gauge hot rolled products including high strength low alloy and medium carbon steels these products are suitable for automobile suspension arms frames wheels and other unexposed parts in auto and truck bodies truck trailer and recreational vehicle parts and components mechanical and structural steel tubing gas and fluid transmission piping building and construction products rail cars ships barges and other marine equipment agricultural equipment and farm implements lawn garden and recreation equipment industrial machinery and shipping containers and highway guard rails we believe that our basic hot rolled material has shape characteristics that exceed those of other thinslab flat roll steel minimills and compares favorably with those of the integrated steel mills 

we sell a portion of our hot rolled coils produced at our flat roll mill directly to endusers or more often to intermediate steel processors and service centers where they may be pickled cold rolled annealed tempered galvanized or painted by those customers the rest of the hot rolled coils are directed to our cold mill where we add value to this product through our own pickling cold rolling annealing tempering galvanizing and painting processes a portion of our cold rolled production is shipped to our jeffersonville indiana galvanizing facility 

cold rolled products cold rolled steel is hot rolled steel that has been further processed through a pickler and then passed through a rolling mill until the desired gauge or thickness and other physical properties have been achieved cold rolling reduces gauge and hardens the steel and when further processed through an annealing furnace and a temper mill improves uniformity ductility and formability cold rolling can also impart various surface finishes and textures cold rolled steel is used in exposed steel applications that demand higher surface quality or finish such as exposed automobile and appliance panels cold rolled material is often coated or painted as a result of higher processing costs cold rolled prices are typically higher than hot rolled prices 

coated products hot rolled or cold rolled steel can be coated with zinc to render it corrosionresistant and to improve its paintability galvanized galvannealed galvalume® electrogalvanized and aluminized products are types of coated steels these are also the highest valueadded sheet products because they require the greatest degree of processing and tend to have the strictest quality requirements coated steel is used in high volume applications such as automobiles household appliances roofing and siding heating and air conditioning equipment air ducts switch boxes chimney flues awnings garbage cans and food containers our paint lines in butler and jeffersonville incorporate stateoftheart coil coating equipment with quick color change capability and online color matching which allows us to produce prepainted steel products that are used in many of these same end products 

we also produce hot rolled pickled and oiled hot rolled galvanized hot rolled galvannealed cold rolled galvanized cold rolled galvannealed and fully processed cold rolled sheet as a result of our lighter gauge hot rolling capabilities our hot rolled galvanized and galvannealed steel products are capable of replacing products that have traditionally only been available as more expensive cold rolled galvanized or cold rolled galvannealed steel this material is typically used in transportation products building products such as raised garage door panels heating and cooling products appliances furniture and lighting equipment 

customers steel processors and service centers typically act as intermediaries between primary steel producers and the many enduser manufacturers that require further processing of hot rolled coils the additional processing performed by the intermediate steel processors and service centers include pickling galvanizing cutting to length slitting to size leveling blanking shape correcting edge rolling shearing and stamping we believe that our intermediate steel processor and service center customers will remain an integral part of our customer base the location of our jeffersonville facility on the ohio river also creates opportunities for market expansion into other geographic regions the techs produces galvanized flat rolled products that are similar to those produced by our flat roll division and sold to a similar customer base each of the techs facilities specializes in the galvanizing of specific types of flat rolled steels in generally nonautomotive applications servicing a variety of customers in the heating ventilation and air conditioning hvac construction agriculture and consumer goods markets we exported 2 of our sheet products during both 2012 and 2011 

during 2012 we sold our flat rolled products to approximately 300 customers heidtman steel products inc which is principally owned by one of our directors accounted for approximately 3 of our consolidated net sales in both 2012 and 2011 respectively

metals recycling and ferrous resources operations 

metals recycling 

our metals recycling operations include both ferrous and nonferrous scrap metal processing transportation marketing brokerage and consulting services in over 70 locations primarily in the midwest and southeast portion of the united states in addition omnisource designs installs and manages customized scrap management programs for industrial manufacturing companies at nearly 400 locations throughout north america our steel mills utilize a portion of the steel scrap processed through omnisource as raw material in our steelmaking operations and the remainder is sold to other consumers such as other steel manufacturers and foundries in 2012 2011 and 2010 omnisource supplied our steel mills with approximately 51 52 and 47 respectively of the tons of their ferrous raw material requirements representing approximately 46 43 and 42 respectively of omnisources 2012 2011 and 2010 ferrous shipped tons 

our metals recycling operations processed andor brokered approximately 56 million gross tons and 59 million gross tons of ferrous material during 2012 and 2011 respectively omnisource also processed and brokered approximately 11 billion pounds of nonferrous material during 2012 and 2011 omnisources revenues by major scrap category were 64 ferrous and 36 nonferrous including stainless in 2012 and 2011 during 2012 and 2011 approximately 10 and 11 respectively of omnisources revenues were from export sales primarily from nonferrous materials 

we sell various grades of ferrous scrap metals to steel mills and foundries and we sell various grades of nonferrous metals such as copper brass aluminum and stainless steel we generally sell these nonferrous materials to aluminum sheet and ingot manufacturers brass and bronze ingot makers copper refineries and mills smelters specialty mills alloy manufacturers and other consumers ferrous scrap metal is the primary raw material for electric arc furnaces such as those operated by our steel mills we purchase ferrous and nonferrous scrap metals processed and unprocessed in a variety of forms for our metals recycling facilities 

ferrous scrap comes from two primary sources i manufacturers and industrial plants metal fabrication plants machine shops and factories which generate steel scrap referred to as prompt or industrial scrap and ii scrap dealers retail individuals auto wreckers demolition firms and others who generate steel and iron scrap referred to as obsolete scrap market demand and the composition quality size weight and location of the materials are the primary factors that determine prices we purchase nonferrous scrap from three primary sources i manufacturers and other nonferrous scrap sources which generate or sell scrap aluminum copper stainless steel and other nonferrous metals ii producers of electricity telecommunication service providers aerospace defense and recycling companies that generate nonferrous scrap consisting primarily of copper wire aluminum beverage cans and various other metals and alloys and iii retail individuals who deliver directly to our facilities material which they collect from a variety of sources during 2012 the company continued to expand its number of retail yards in strategic locations to increase costeffective scrap sourcing additional retail yard expansion is planned for 2013 we also collect ferrous and nonferrous scrap from sources other than those that are delivered directly to our processing facilities by placing retrieval containers near these sources the containers are subsequently transported to our processing facilities 

our metals recycling facilities consist of offices warehouse buildings and openair collection and processing facilities of various sizes and acreages equipped with specialized equipment for processing both ferrous and nonferrous metal where we receive sort process and store the metals we equip our facilities with scales shears baling presses briquetting machines conveyors and magnetic separators which enable us to efficiently process large volumes of scrap metals to facilitate processing shipping and receiving we equip our ferrous metal processing centers with presses shredders or hydraulic shears to prepare and compress scrap metal for easier handling cranes are utilized to handle scrap metals for processing and to load material for shipment many of our facilities have rail access as ferrous scrap is primarily shipped by open gondola railcar additionally several of the metals recycling divisions have achieved certifications including iso 90012008 and iso 140012004 certification we continue to make improvements such as our successful installation and commissioning at three locations of the gamma tech analyzer which allows for a more precise measure of copper content in scrap metal these additions have benefited our steel mills by providing a known lowcopper scrap source while providing omnisource a competitive product advantage to other customers during 2012 we began to construct enhanced downstream separation technology at two of our locations which when operational in 2013 will further enhance the recovery of nonferrous materials from residual shredded material and decrease landfill costs 

products our metals recycling operations primarily involve the purchase processing and resale of ferrous and nonferrous scrap metals into reusable forms and grades 

we process an array of ferrous products used in foundry and steel mill applications for use in our own steel mills or for resale to other customers through a variety of methods including sorting shearing cutting torching baling shredding briquetting and breaking our major ferrous products include heavy melting steel busheling bundled scrap shredded scrap and other scrap metal products such as steel turnings and cast iron these products vary in properties or attributes related to cleanness size of individual pieces and residual alloys these factors are determined by the specific needs and requirements of the consumer and affect the individual products relative value we process nonferrous products including aluminum brass copper stainless steel and other nonferrous metals for use in 

foundry mill refining and smelting applications our superior aluminum alloys operations produce specification aluminum alloys in the form of ingots sows and molten metal in addition we provide transportation logistics truck rail and river barge management services marketing brokerage and consulting services related to the scrap industry 

customers we sell processed ferrous scrap to endusers such as steel producing minimills integrated steelmakers foundries secondary smelters and metal brokers who aggregate materials for other large users most of our ferrousscrap customers purchase processed scrap through negotiated spot sales contracts which establish a quantity purchase for the month the price we charge for ferrous scrap depends upon market demand and transportation costs as well as the quality and grade of the scrap in many cases our selling price also includes the cost of transportation to the enduser 

we sell processed nonferrous scrap to endusers such as specialty steelmakers foundries aluminum sheet and ingot manufacturers copper refineries and smelters brass and bronze ingot manufacturers wire and cable producers utilities and telephone networks 

markets according to the institute of scrap recycling industries isri approximately 74 million metric tons and 66 million metric tons of recycled iron and steel including stainless and alloys were processed in the united states during 2011 and 2010 respectively in addition approximately nine million and eight million metric tons of nonferrous scrap including aluminum copper lead and zinc were processed during both 2011 and 2010 respectively scrap is a global commodity influenced by conditions in a number of industrialized and emergingmarkets throughout asia europe and north america isri estimates that approximately 23 million metric tons and 19 million metric tons of ferrous scrap were exported from the united states in 2011 and 2010 respectively nonferrous exports from the united states were estimated by isri to be 34 million metric tons and 30 million metric tons in 2011 and 2010 respectively 

scrap metal supplies are generated from a variety of sources industrial scrap or home scrap is generated from steel processing and manufacturing facilities utilizing steel in their production process obsolete scrap including post consumer waste demolition of steel structures and automobiles represent a significant source of scrap generation we do not purchase a material amount of scrap metal from a single source or from a limited number of major sources 

competitors the markets for scrap metals are highly competitive both in the purchase of raw scrap and the sale of processed scrap with regard to the purchase of raw scrap we compete with numerous independent recyclers as well as smaller scrap companies engaged only in collecting industrial scrap in many cases we also purchase unprocessed scrap metal from smaller scrap dealers and other processors successful procurement of materials is determined primarily by the price offered by the purchaser for the raw scrap and the proximity of our processing facility to the source of the raw scrap both ferrous and nonferrous scrap sells as a commodity in both national and international markets which are affected by relative economic conditions currency fluctuations and the availability and cost of transportation competition for sales of processed scrap is based primarily on the price quality and location of the scrap metals as well as the level of service provided in terms of reliability and timing of delivery 

we also face potential competition for sales of processed scrap from other producers of steel products such as integrated steel mills and steel minimills some of which are vertically integrated in the scrap metals recycling business as a number of steel manufacturers as we do currently operate their own scrap yards in addition other steel mills may compete with us in attempting to secure scrap supply through direct purchasing from our scrap suppliers scrap metal processors also face competition from substitutes for prepared ferrous scrap such as prereduced iron pellets hot briquetted iron pig iron iron carbide and other forms of processed iron the availability and relative prices of substitutes 

for ferrous scrap could result in a decreased demand for processed ferrous scrap and could result in lower prices andor lower demand for our scrap products 

the industry is highly fragmented with many smaller familyowned companies although omnisource also competes with a number of national and global companies each of which has multiple locations in areas in which omnisource also operates these larger entities include the david j joseph company a subsidiary of nucor corporation sims metal management psc metals aleris international cmc a division of commercial metals company and schnitzer steel in addition omnisource competes with many regional scrap companies no single scrap metals recycler has a significant market share in the domestic market 

ferrous resources 

iron dynamics 

iron dynamics developed a process of producing liquid pig iron and hot briquetted iron hbi that serves as a substitute for a portion of the metallic raw material mix that goes into our electric arc furnaces to produce steel direct reduced iron dri is a metallic product made from millscale and iron ore fines that has been reduced in a rotary hearth furnace using natural gas and coal the reduction method employed by iron dynamics uses coal as the reducing agent the dri is either compacted by briquetters to form hbi or is processed further to produce liquid pig iron hbi can be immediately used in our melting furnaces or stockpiled for later use liquid pig iron is tapped from iron dynamics submerged arc furnace and immediately transferred in ladles to the flat roll mills melt shop where it is combined with scrap steel in the mills electric arc furnaces 

the plants primary focus is to maximize liquid pig iron production due to the inherent economic benefits achieved when the material is used in the steelmaking process such as reduced energy cost reduced materials cost and quicker melting cycles during 2012 and 2011 respectively iron dynamics produced 226000 and 230000 metric tons of which 208000 metric tons or 92 and 198000 metric tons or 86 was liquid pig iron we have used and plan to use all of the facilitys output in our flat roll steelmaking operations 

minnesota iron operations—mesabi nugget mesabi mining and mining resources 

our minnesota iron operations consists of mesabi nugget owned 81 by us our planned future iron mining operations which is currently in the permitting process mesabi mining and our iron tailings operations mining resources owned 80 by us mesabi nugget is the worlds first commercial ironmaking facility to use the itmk3® process an ironnugget production technology pioneered by kobe steel ltd which kobe steel is licensing to the venture the construction of the mesabi nugget facility was completed in 2009 and initial production of iron nuggets commenced january 2010 since that time we have continued to refine this pioneering production process and changed equipment configurations to increase production improve quality and increase plant availability a planned sixweek outage in the fall of 2012 was used to complete the groundwork necessary for the implementation of further improvements expected to be made in the first half of 2013 these modifications are expected to improve both volume and product quality the facilitys designed annual production capacity is 500000 metric tons in 2012 2011 and 2010 mesabi nugget produced and shipped 169000 160000 and 67000 metric tons of ironnuggets respectively for use by our own steel mills our iron tailings operation mining resources started operations in the fourth quarter of 2012 and expects to be at full capacity during the first half of 2013 this operation which involves the extraction of iron ore tailings from previously developed stockpiles or waterfiled tailings basins provides iron ore tailings to be concentrated for use by mesabi nugget as lowcost iron concentrate in the nugget production process 

sources availability and cost of steel and other operations raw materials 

scrap metals our principal raw material of our steel operations segment is scrap metal derived from among other sources home scrap generated internally at steel mills themselves industrial scrap generated as a byproduct of manufacturing and obsolete scrap recycled from endoflife automobiles appliances railroad cars and railroad track materials agricultural machinery and demolition scrap from obsolete structures containers and machines 

scrap typically comprises more than 80 of the metallic melt mix in electric arc furnace steelmaking in contrast to integrated mill steelmaking where the proportion of scrap has traditionally been approximately 25 to 35 depending upon the scrap substitute material that may be available from time to time and the relative cost of such material the percentage of scrap used in our steelmaking operations could be reduced in our metallic melt mix 

many variables can impact scrap prices all of which reflect the pushes and pulls of the supply demand equation these factors include the level of us new steel production for highquality lowresidual scrap is a byproduct of new steel manufacturing activity the level of exports of scrap from the united states the amount of obsolete scrap production and the effect of speculation on the amount of scrap offered on the market from time to time generally as domestic steel demand increases so does scrap demand and resulting scrap prices the reverse is also normally but not always true with scrap prices following steel prices downward when supply exceeds demand 

the following table provides pricing per gross ton from american metal market and iron age pig iron estimates for ferrous materials used in steel production 

the price of steel scrap as a commodity has tended to be volatile rising and falling with supply and demand and not always in lock step with or in proportion to the market price of new steel when scrap costs greatly accelerate this threatens one of the principal elements of a minimills traditional lower cost structure—the cost of its metallic raw material therefore having a lower cost alternative source of iron for a portion of a minimills melt mix if realizable would partially buffer the effects of high scrap prices and scrap price volatility with the growing proportion of electric furnace steelmaking both worldwide and domestically we believe that the benefit of developing a costeffective alternate iron source to augment scrap our primary raw material makes good economic sense in the long run 

iron units in addition to scrap direct reduced iron hot briquetted iron pig iron and ironnuggets are used in electric furnace minimill steel production during 2012 and 2011 we 

consumed 60 million tons of metallic materials in our steel making furnaces of which iron units other than scrap represented approximately 8 and 7 of the tons respectively of these iron substitute units consumed our iron dynamics and mesabi nugget operations together supplied 90 and 87 of these iron units in 2012 and 2011 respectively 

iron concentrate and coal at our mesabi nugget operations iron concentrate and coal represent the most significant raw material inputs necessary to iron nugget production we historically have been able to obtain all our iron concentrate needs from reliable external sources these external sources generally price the iron concentrate quarterly with the price driven largely by a small number of suppliers and the global market for iron iron concentrate costs were therefore outside our control and could change independent of other ferrous scrap costs development of our own more stable lowcost iron sources like mining resources and mesabi mining is therefore a very meaningful step in securing a more stable supply of lower cost iron units 

coal pricing is typically set annually and although supply is generally sufficient as there are ample reliable sources domestically unexpected mine outages can interrupt availability and potentially increase our costs given the annual pricing and the potential supply interruptions the cost of coal may not correlate with the ever changing environment of iron unit scrap and steel pricing 

steel fabrication operations 

our steel fabrication operations primarily serve the nonresidential construction industry in october 2010 we purchased certain joist assets from another manufacturer including three plants located in hope arkansas fallon nevada and juarez mexico these new facilities when combined with our existing facilities operating in indiana florida and virginia give us a national footprint that allow us to service the entire us construction market as well as national accounts such as large retail chains 

we fabricate trusses girders steel joists and steel decking primarily for the nonresidential building components market total production of all products was 295000 tons and 218000 tons during 2012 and 2011 respectively our flat roll division and roanoke bar division supply a substantial portion of the steel utilized in these manufacturing operations 

products our fabrication operations produce steel building components including steel joists girders and trusses our individual joist products include bowstring arched scissor doublepitched and singlepitched joists our indiana florida and virginia plants also produce a full range of steel roof form and composite floor decking 

customers our primary fabrication customers are nonresidential steel fabricators other customers include metal building companies general construction contractors developers brokers and governmental entities our customers are located throughout the united states with a concentration in the eastern half of the country through our new locations at arkansas nevada and juarez mexico we are facilitating the expansion of our fabrication operations to us construction markets in the southwest and the west and to national accounts 

markets our fabrication operations primarily serve the nonresidential construction industry the recent downturn and slow recovery in the nonresidential construction markets has resulted in demand for joist and deck products to decrease from previous levels seen in 2008 and prior the steel joist and deck market in the united states was approximately 10 million tons in 2009 and 2010 rebounded slightly to 12 million tons in 2011 and then further to 13 million tons in 2012 per the steel manufacturers association we believe the ramp up of our recently acquired locations will continue to proceed as the market strengthens we believe the longterm prospects for this business are sound and market indices increases in the latter half of 2012 provide some positive signs of recovery 

competitors our main competitors in the joist business are vulcraft a division of nucor corporation canam group quincy joist co joist structural and valley joist in the steel decking business new millenniums main competitors are vulcraft wheeling corrugating co quincy joist co consolidated systems inc and canam group 

energy resources 

electricity electricity is a significant input required in the electric arc furnaces in our steelmaking operations excluding the techs representing 5 of steel production costs of goods sold in 2012 and 2011 we have entered into a fixed price interruptible electricity supply agreement that extends through december 31 2014 for our flat roll division in butler indiana the contract allows our supplier to interrupt service in the event of an emergency or in response to various market conditions our engineered bar products division has a combination of fixed pricing and market pricing for the various components of the electrical services demand charge energy charge riders etc our structural and rail division roanoke bar division and steel of west virginia purchase electricity at current market prices 

natural gas we purchase a portion of our steel operations natural gas requirements at market prices and a portion by entering into hedging transactions on the futures markets for ultimate physical delivery in order to help minimize price volatility these contracts typically have duration of up to 24 months but on occasion may extend further natural gas represented 13 and 15 of steel operations excluding the techs costs of goods sold in 2012 and 2011 respectively

environmental matters 

our steel operations metals recycling and ferrous resources operations and steel fabrication operations are subject to substantial and evolving local state and federal environmental health and safety laws and regulations concerning among other things emissions to the air discharges to surface and ground water and to sewer systems and the generation handling storage transportation 

treatment and disposal of toxic and hazardous substances our manufacturing operations are dependent upon both state and federal permits regulating discharges into the air or into the water in order to operate our facilities we believe that in all current respects our steel operations metals recycling and ferrous resources operations and steel fabrication operations are in material compliance with all provisions of federal and state laws concerning the environment and we do not currently believe that future compliance with such provisions will have a material adverse effect on our results of operations cash flows or financial condition 

since the level of enforcement of environmental laws and regulations or the nature of those laws that may be enacted from time to time are sometimes subject to changing social or political pressures our environmental capital expenditures and costs for environmental compliance may increase in the future in addition due to the possibility of unanticipated regulatory or other developments the amount and timing of future environmental expenditures may vary substantially from those currently anticipated the cost of current and future environmental compliance may also place us steel producers at a competitive disadvantage with respect to foreign steel producers which may not be required to undertake equivalent costs in their operations 

pursuant to the resource conservation and recovery act or rcra which governs the treatment handling and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes the united states environmental protection agency or us epa and authorized state environmental agencies conduct inspections of rcra regulated facilities to identify areas where there may have been releases of solid or hazardous constituents into the environment and require the facilities to take corrective action to remediate any such releases rcra also allows citizens to bring certain suits against regulated facilities for potential damages and clean up our steelmaking facilities are subject to rcra our manufacturing operations produce various byproducts some of which for example electric arc furnace or eaf dust are categorized as industrial or hazardous waste requiring special handling for disposal or for the recovery of metallics we collect such coproducts in approved baghouses and other facilities but we are also examining alternative reclamation technologies to recycle some of these products while we cannot predict the future actions of the regulators or other interested parties the potential exists for required corrective action at these facilities the costs of which could be substantial 

under the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act or cercla the us epa and in some instances private parties have the authority to impose joint and several liability for the remediation of contaminated properties upon generators of waste current and former site owners and operators transporters and other potentially responsible parties regardless of fault or the legality of the original disposal activity many states including indiana have statutes and regulatory authorities similar to cercla and to the us epa we have a number of waste handling agreements with various contractors to properly dispose of our electric arc furnace dust and certain other waste products of steelmaking however we cannot assure that even if there has been no fault by us we may not still be cited as a waste generator by reason of an environmental clean up at a site to which our waste products were transported 

in addition to rcra and cercla there are a number of other environmental health and safety laws and regulations that apply to our facilities and may affect our operations by way of example and not of limitation certain portions of the federal clean air act clean water act toxic substances control act oil pollution act safe drinking water act and emergency planning and community righttoknow act as well as state and local laws and regulations implemented by the regulatory agencies apply to our facilities operations many of these laws allow both the governments and citizens to bring certain suits against regulated facilities for alleged environmental violations finally any steelmaking and metals recycling company could be subject to certain toxic tort suits brought by citizens or other third parties alleging causes of action such as nuisance negligence trespass infliction of emotional distress or other claims alleging personal injury or property damage 

employees 

our work force consisted of approximately 6670 full time employees at december 31 2012 of which approximately 10 were represented by collective bargaining agreements the largest group of unionized employees is at steel of west virginia the remaining unionized employees are located in five different omnisource metals recycling locations each of which has its own agreement we believe that our relationship with our employees is good

 item 1a risk factors 

  many factors could have an effect on our financial condition cash flows and results of operations we are subject to various risks resulting from changing economic environmental political industry business and financial conditions the factors described below represent our principal risks  

risks related to our industry 

our industry is affected by domestic and global economic factors including the risk of a recurrent recession 

our financial results are substantially dependent not only upon overall economic conditions in the united states in europe and in asia but also as they may affect one or more of the industries upon which we depend for the sale of our products the sluggish pace of the recovery from the deep global recession that began in the united states in 2008 is continuing to have an adverse effect on demand for our products and therefore the results of our operations and a further prolongation of that recession could further decrease the demand for our products and further adversely affect our business in addition uncertainty over the potential economic consequences of the continuing budgetary impasse in the united states could have a further adverse impact on demand for our products moreover the european debt crisis has created additional uncertainty that could further exacerbate the recovery metals industries have historically been vulnerable to significant declines in consumption and product pricing during periods of economic downturn likewise the pace of domestic nonresidential construction activity has historically slowed during economic downturns and has been at historically low levels in recent years 

our business is also dependent upon certain industries such as commercial and government construction energy metals service centers automotive agriculture transportation petrochemical and original equipment manufacturing and these industries are also cyclical in nature therefore these industries may experience their own fluctuations in demand for our products based on such things as economic conditions energy prices consumer demand and infrastructure funding decisions by governments many of these factors are beyond our control as a result of the volatility in the industries we serve we may have difficulty increasing or maintaining our level of sales or profitability if the industries we serve were to suffer a downturn then our business may be further adversely affected 

our level of production and our sales and earnings are subject to significant fluctuations as a result of the cyclical nature of the steel industry and some of the industries we serve 

the steel manufacturing business is cyclical in nature and the price of the steel we make may fluctuate significantly due to many factors beyond our control furthermore many of our products are commodities subject to their own cyclical fluctuations in supply and demand in both metal consuming and metal generating industries including the construction industry the timing and magnitude of these price fluctuations are difficult to predict the sale of our manufactured steel products is directly affected by demand for our products in other cyclical industries such as the automotive oil and gas gas transmission residential and commercialindustrial construction commercial equipment rail transportation appliance agricultural and durable goods industries while the domestic automotive industry which is a major consumer of new steel and a major generator of steel scrap has shown recent signs of improvement it has not yet fully recovered from the recent unprecedented downturn in demand economic difficulties stagnant economies supplydemand imbalances and currency fluctuations in the united states or globally could further decrease the demand for our products or increase the amount of imports of steel into the united states which could decrease our sales margins and profitability 

the scrap metal recycling industry has historically been and is expected to remain highly cyclical a prolonged period of low scrap prices could result in the weakening of inbound scrap flows and thereby reduce our ability to obtain process and sell recycled materials and this could have a material adverse effect on our metals recycling operations results 

scrap metal prices are volatile and operating results within the metals recycling industry in general have historically been cyclical and are expected to remain highly cyclical in nature similarly but not necessarily paralleling the price fluctuations in the steel business the purchase prices for automobile bodies and various other grades of obsolete and industrial scrap as well as the selling prices for processed and recycled scrap metals we utilize in our own manufacturing process or we resell to others through our metals recycling operations are also highly volatile as a metals recycler we may attempt to respond to changing recycled metal selling prices by adjusting the scrap metal purchase prices we pay to others but our ability to do this may be limited by competitive or other factors during periods of low scrap prices when inbound scrap flow may slow considerably as scrap generators hold onto their scrap in hopes of getting higher prices later conversely periodic increased foreign demand for scrap can result in an outflow of available domestic scrap as well as resulting higher scrap prices domestically that cannot always be passed on to domestic scrap consumers thereby further reducing available domestic scrap flows and scrap margins all of which could adversely affect our sales and profitability 

imports of steel into the united states have in the past adversely affected and may again adversely affect us steel prices which could impact our sales margins and profitability 

global steelmaking capacity currently exceeds global consumption of steel products such excess capacity sometimes results in steel manufacturers in certain countries exporting steel at prices that are lower than prevailing domestic prices and sometimes at or below their cost of production excessive imports of steel into the united states as a result of excess world supply have in past years exerted and may again in the future exert downward pressure on us steel prices and may reduce or may negatively affect our ability to increase our sales margins and profitability us steel producers compete with many foreign producers including those in china competition from foreign producers is typically strong and is periodically exacerbated by weakening of the economies of certain foreign steelmaking countries greater steel exports to the united states tend to occur at depressed prices when steel producing countries experience periods of economic difficulty decreased demand for steel products or excess capacity 

in addition we believe the downward pressure on and periodically depressed levels of us steel prices in some recent years have been further exacerbated by imports of steel involving dumping and subsidy abuses by foreign steel producers some foreign steel producers are owned controlled or subsidized by foreign governments as a result decisions by these producers with respect to their production sales and pricing are sometimes influenced to a greater degree by political and economic policy considerations than by prevailing market conditions realities of the marketplace or consideration of profit or loss however while some tariffs and quotas are periodically put into effect for certain steel products imported from a number of countries that have been found to have been unfairly pricing steel imports to the us there is no assurance that tariffs and quotas will always be levied even if otherwise justified and even when imposed many of these are only shortlived when such tariffs or duties expire or if others are further relaxed or repealed or if relatively higher us steel prices make it attractive for foreign steelmakers to export their steel products to the united states despite the presence of duties or tariffs the resurgence of substantial imports of foreign steel could create downward pressure on us steel prices 

chinas current steelmaking overcapacity in relation to its steel consumption could have a material adverse effect on domestic and global steel pricing and could result in increased steel imports into the united states 

a significant factor in the worldwide volatility of steel pricing in recent years was the explosive growth in chinese steel consumption in relation to its domestic production which until the third quarter of 2008 had vastly outpaced that countrys capacity to produce steel in sufficient quantity to serve its internal demand the shortage of chinese domestic steel supply during this time period resulted not only in heightened chinese demand for imported steel and other raw materials with a consequent upward spiral in worldwide steel pricing for finished steel products but also led to a rapid and significant expansion of steel production capacity in china as well as many of the commodities supplies and services utilized in steelmaking however the addition of new chinese steel production capacity coupled with the subsequent drop in chinese steel consumption that began in 2008 and the continued utilization of a large amount of outdated inefficient and government subsidized production capacity has resulted in a situation in which chinas steel producing capacity currently exceeds that countrys decreasing demand for many kinds of steel products that we produce and has made china an increasingly larger net exporter of steel therefore a combination of a slowdown in chinas economic growth rate and steel consumption coupled with its own expansion of steelmaking capacity could result in a continuing stagnation or further weakening of both domestic and global steel demand and steel pricing also should chinese steelmaking capacity remain the same or further increase or should its demand either further slow or weaken china might not only remain a net exporter of steel but many asian and european steel producers whose steel output previously fed chinas steel import needs could find their way into the us market through increased steel imports causing a further erosion of margins or negatively impacting our ability to increase our prices 

the worldwide economic downturn that began in 2008 and the difficult conditions in the global industrial capital and credit markets that resulted have adversely affected and may continue to adversely affect our business and our industry as well as the industries of many of our customers and suppliers upon whom we are dependent 

many of the markets in which our customers participate such as the automotive consumer products original equipment agriculture transportation manufacturing commercial residential and government construction and metals service center industries are also cyclical in nature and experience significant fluctuations in demand for our steel products based on economic conditions consumer demand raw material and energy costs and decisions by our government to fund or not fund infrastructure projects such as highways bridges schools energy plants railroads and transportation facilities many of these factors are beyond our control these markets are highly competitive to a 

large extent driven by enduse markets and may experience overcapacity all of which may affect demand for and pricing of our products 

a continued or further decline in consumer and business confidence and spending together with severe reductions in the availability and cost of credit as well as volatility in the capital and credit markets could adversely affect the business and economic environment in which we operate and the profitability of our business we are also exposed to risks associated with the creditworthiness of our suppliers and customers if the availability of credit to fund or support the continuation and expansion of our customers business operations is curtailed or if the cost of that credit is increased the resulting inability of our customers or of their customers to access either credit or absorb the increased cost of that credit could adversely affect our business by reducing our sales or by increasing our exposure to losses from uncollectible customer accounts these conditions and a renewed disruption of the credit markets could also result in financial instability of some of our suppliers and customers the consequences of such adverse effects could include the interruption of production at the facilities of our customers the reduction delay or cancellation of customer orders delays or interruptions of the supply of raw materials we purchase and bankruptcy of customers suppliers or other creditors any of these events may adversely affect our profitability cash flow and financial condition 

volatility and major fluctuations in scrap metal and pig iron prices and our potential inability to pass higher costs on to our customers may constrain operating levels and reduce profit margins 

steel producers require large amounts of raw materials including scrap metal and scrap substitute products such as pig iron pelletized iron and other supplies such as graphite electrodes and ferroalloys our principal raw material is scrap metal derived primarily from junked automobiles industrial scrap railroad cars railroad track materials agricultural machinery and demolition scrap from obsolete structures containers and machines the prices for scrap are subject to market forces largely beyond our control including demand by us and international steel producers freight costs and speculation the prices for scrap have varied significantly may vary significantly in the future and do not necessarily fluctuate in tandem with the price of steel moreover some of our integrated steel producer competitors are not as dependent as we are on scrap as a part of their raw material melt mix which during periods of high scrap costs relative to the cost of blast furnace iron used by the integrated producers give them a raw material cost advantage over minimills while our vertical integration into the metals recycling business through our omnisource subsidiary and into the ironmaking business through our iron dynamics facility and our minnesota iron operations should enable us to be a costeffective supplier to our steelmaking operations for some of our metallics requirements we will still need to rely on other metallics and raw material suppliers as well as upon general industry supply conditions for the balance of our needs 

purchase prices for auto bodies scrap metal and scrap substitute products such as pig iron that we consume and selling prices for scrap and recycled metals that we sell to third parties are volatile and beyond our control while omnisource attempts to respond to changing recycled metal selling prices through adjustments to its metal purchase prices its ability to do so is limited by competitive and other market factors changing prices could potentially impact the volume of scrap metal available to us and the volume and realized margins of processed metals we sell 

the availability and prices of raw materials may also be negatively affected by new laws and regulations allocation by suppliers interruptions in production accidents or natural disasters changes in exchange rates worldwide price fluctuations and the availability and cost of transportation 

if prices for ferrous metallics increase by a greater margin than corresponding price increases for the sale of our steel products we may not be able to recoup such cost increases from increases in the selling prices of steel products conversely depressed prices for ferrous scrap may constrain the supply of steel scrap which may adversely affect our metals recycling operations and also the availability of 

certain grades of scrap for our steelmaking operations additionally our inability to pass on all or any substantial part of any cost increases during periods of rapidly rising scrap prices through scrap or other surcharges or to provide for our customers needs because of the potential unavailability of key raw materials or other inputs may result in production curtailments or may otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations or prospects 

the cost and availability of electricity and natural gas are also subject to volatile market conditions 

steel producers like us consume large amounts of energy inasmuch as minimills melt steel scrap in electric arc furnaces and use natural gas to heat steel billets for rolling into finished products we rely on third parties for the supply of energy resources we consume in our steelmaking activities the prices for and availability of electricity natural gas oil and other energy resources are also subject to volatile market conditions often affected by weather conditions as well as political and economic factors beyond our control as large consumers of electricity and gas we must have dependable delivery in order to operate accordingly we are at risk in the event of an energy disruption prolonged blackouts or brownouts or disruptions caused by natural disasters or by political considerations would substantially disrupt our production moreover much of our finished steel products are typically delivered by truck unforeseen fluctuations in the price of fuel attributable to fluctuations in crude oil prices would also have a negative impact on our costs or on the costs of many of our customers in addition changes in certain environmental regulations in the us including those that may impose output limitations or higher costs associated with climate change or greenhouse gas emissions legislation could substantially increase the cost of manufacturing and raw materials such as energy to us and other us steel producers 

fluctuations in the value of the united states dollar relative to other currencies may adversely affect our business 

fluctuations in the value of the dollar can be expected to affect our business a strong us dollar makes imported metal products less expensive potentially resulting in more imports of steel products into the us by our foreign competitors while a weak us dollar may have the opposite impact on imports 

compliance with and changes in environmental and remediation requirements could result in substantially increased capital requirements and operating costs 

existing laws or regulations as currently interpreted or as may be interpreted in the future as well as future laws or regulations may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

we are subject to comprehensive local state federal and international statutory and regulatory environmental requirements relating to among other things 

• the acceptance storage treatment handling and disposal of solid and hazardous waste • the discharge of materials into the air • the management and treatment of wastewater and storm water • the remediation of soil and groundwater contamination • global climate change legislation or regulation • the need for and the ability to timely obtain air water or other operating permits • the remediation and reclamation of land used for iron mining • natural resource damages and 26 

• the protection of our employees health and safety compliance with environmental laws and regulations which affect our steelmaking metals recycling and ironmaking operations is a significant factor in our business we are required to obtain and comply with environmental permits and licenses and failure to obtain or renew or the violation of any permit or license if not remedied could result in substantial fines and penalties suspension of operations or the closure of a subject facility similarly delays increased costs or the imposition of onerous conditions to the securing or renewal of operating permits such as those required by our mesabi mining mesabi nugget or mining resources ironmaking operations could have a material adverse effect on these operations 

private parties might also bring claims against us for alleged property damage or personal injury resulting from the environmental impacts of our operations moreover legal requirements change frequently are subject to interpretation and have tended to become more stringent over time uncertainty regarding adequate pollution control levels testing and sampling procedures and new pollution control technology are factors that may increase our future compliance expenditures we are unable to predict the ultimate cost of future compliance with these requirements or their effect on our operations and we also cannot predict whether such costs can be passed on to customers through product price increases although we believe that we are in substantial compliance with all applicable laws and regulations legal requirements frequently change and are subject to interpretation new laws regulations and changing interpretations by regulatory authorities together with uncertainty regarding adequate pollution control levels testing and sampling procedures new pollution control technology and cost benefit analysis based on market conditions are all factors that may increase our future expenditures to comply with environmental requirements the cost of complying with existing laws or regulations as currently interpreted or reinterpreted in the future or with future laws or regulations may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

our manufacturing and recycling operations produce significant amounts of byproducts some of which are handled as industrial waste or hazardous waste for example our mills generate electric arc furnace eaf dust which the united states environmental protection agency usepa and other regulatory authorities classify as hazardous waste eaf dust requires special handling recycling and disposal 

in addition the primary feed materials for the shredders operated by our metals recycling operations are automobile hulks and obsolete household appliances approximately 20 of the weight of an automobile hulk consists of unrecyclable material known as shredder fluff after the segregation of ferrous and saleable nonferrous metals shredder fluff remains we along with others in the recycling industry interpret federal regulations to require shredder fluff to meet certain criteria and pass a toxic leaching test to avoid classification as a hazardous waste we also endeavor to remove hazardous contaminants from the feed material prior to shredding as a result we believe the shredder fluff we generate is not normally considered or properly classified as hazardous waste however if laws or regulations the interpretation of the laws or regulations or testing methods change with regard to eaf dust or shredder fluff we may incur significant additional expenditures 

the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act cercla or superfund enables usepa and state agencies to recover from owners operators generators and transporters the cost of investigation and cleanup of sites which pose serious threats to the environment or public health in connection with cercla and analogous state laws we may be required to clean up contamination discovered at our sites including contamination that may have been caused by former owners or operators of the sites conduct additional cleanup at sites where we have already participated in remediation efforts or to take remediation action with regard to sites formerly used in connection with our operations 

in addition we may be required to pay for or to pay a portion of the costs of remediation at sites to which we sent hazardous wastes for disposal notwithstanding that the original disposal activity may have complied with all regulatory requirements then in effect pursuant to cercla a potentially responsible party can be held jointly and severally liable for all of the cleanup costs associated with a thirdparty disposal site in practice a liable party often splits the costs of cleanup with other potentially responsible parties we have received notices from usepa state agencies and third parties that we have been identified as potentially responsible for the cost of investigating and cleaning up a number of thirdparty disposal sites in most cases many other parties are also named as potentially responsible parties based upon information currently available to us we do not believe the potential cost in connection with the remediation of these sites will have a material effect on our business 

because cercla can be imposed retroactively on shipments that occurred many years ago and because usepa and state agencies are still discovering sites that pose a threat to public health or the environment we can provide no assurance that we will not become liable in the future for significant costs associated with investigation and remediation of additional cercla cleanup sites 

cercla including the superfund recycling equity act of 1999 limits the exposure of scrap metal recyclers for sales of certain recyclable material under certain circumstances however the recycling defense is subject to the conducting of reasonable care evaluations of current and potential consuming facilities 

increased regulation associated with climate change and greenhouse gas emissions could impose significant additional costs on both our steelmaking and metals recycling operations 

the united states government or various governmental agencies may introduce regulatory changes in response to the potential impacts of climate change international treaties or agreements may also result in increasing regulation of greenhouse gas emissions including the introduction of carbon emissions trading mechanisms any such regulation regarding climate change and greenhouse gas or ghg emissions could impose significant costs on our steelmaking and metals recycling operations and on the operations of our customers and suppliers including increased energy capital equipment environmental monitoring and reporting and other costs in order to comply with current or future laws or regulations concerning and limitations imposed on our operations by virtue of climate change and ghg emissions laws and regulations the potential costs of allowances offsets or credits that may be part of potential capandtrade programs or similar future regulatory measures are still uncertain any adopted future climate change and ghg regulations could negatively impact our ability and that of our customers and suppliers to compete with companies situated in areas not subject to such limitations furthermore recently promulgated more restrictive national ambient air quality standards make it substantially more time consuming costly and difficult to obtain new permits or to modify existing permits 

from a medium and longterm perspective we are likely to see an increase in costs relating to our assets that emit significant amounts of greenhouse gases as a result of these regulatory initiatives these regulatory initiatives will be either voluntary or mandatory and may impact our operations directly or through our suppliers or customers until the timing scope and extent of any future regulation becomes known we cannot predict the effect on our financial condition operating performance and ability to compete 

risks related to the business 

our senior secured credit facility contains and any future financing agreements may contain restrictive covenants that may limit our flexibility 

restrictions and covenants in our existing debt agreements including our senior secured credit facility and any future financing agreements may impair our ability to finance future operations or capital needs or to engage in other business activities specifically these agreements maylimit or restrict our ability to 

• incur additional indebtedness • pay dividends or make distributions with respect to our capital stock in excess of certain amounts • repurchase or redeem capital stock • make some investments • create liens and enter into sale and leaseback transactions • make some capital expenditures • enter into transactions with affiliates or related persons • issue or sell stock of certain subsidiaries • sell or transfer assets and • participate in some joint ventures acquisitions or mergers a breach of any of the restrictions or covenants could cause a default under our senior secured credit facility our senior notes or our other debt a significant portion of our indebtedness then may become immediately due and payable if the default is not remedied 

under our senior secured credit facility we are required to maintain certain financial covenants tied to our leverage liquidity and profitability in addition we are subject to a quarterly borrowing base requirement limiting the maximum availability of our senior secured revolver our ability to meet such covenants or borrowing restrictions can be affected by events beyond our control if a default were to occur the lenders could elect to declare all amounts then outstanding to be immediately due and payable and terminate all commitments to extend further credit if we are unable to repay those amounts the lenders could proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure such indebtedness we have pledged substantially all of our receivables and inventories and all shares of capital stock or other equity interests of our subsidiaries and intercompany debt held by us as collateral for our senior secured credit facility 

we may face significant price and other forms of competition from other steel producers and scrap processors which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operation or prospects 

the global markets in which steel companies and scrap processors conduct business are highly competitive and are becoming even more so due to the current global economic downturn and to consolidations in recent years in the steel industry and in the scrap industry increased competition could cause us to lose market share increase expenditures or reduce pricing any one of which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations or prospects the global steel industry has historically suffered from substantial overcapacity and excess capacity in some of our products will intensify price competition for such products the global demand for steel scrap has also recently decreased due to market conditions causing a decrease in the price of scrap metals a decrease in price could result in some scrap generators exiting the marketplace which could further decrease the availability of scrap this shortage in availability of scrap could have a material adverse effect on both our steelmaking and our metals recycling operations and thus on our business financial condition results of operations or prospects 

we are subject to significant risks relating to changes in commodity prices and may not be able to effectively protect against these risks 

we are exposed to commodity price risk during periods where we hold title to scrap metal products that we may hold in inventory for processing or resale prices of commodities including recycled metals can be volatile due to numerous factors beyond our control in an increasing price environment for raw materials competitive conditions may limit our ability to pass on price increases to our consumers in a decreasing price environment for processed recycled metal we may not have the ability to fully recoup the cost of raw materials that we procure process and sell to our customers in addition new entrants into the market areas we serve could result in higher purchase prices for raw materials and lower margins from our recycled metal we are unable to hedge positions in certain commodities such as recycled ferrous metal where no established futures market exists or where we may from time to time hedge our positions in certain nonferrous metal transactions we could incur losses thus our sales and inventory position will be vulnerable to adverse changes in commodity prices which could materially adversely impact our operating and financial performance 

the profitability of our metals recycling operations depends in part on the availability of an adequate source of supply 

we procure our recyclable metal inventory from numerous sources these suppliers generally are not bound by longterm contracts and have no obligation to sell recyclable metal to us in periods of low industry prices suppliers may elect to hold recyclable metal to wait for higher prices or intentionally slow their metal collection activities if a substantial number of suppliers cease selling recyclable metal to us we will be unable to recycle metal at desired levels and our results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected in addition a slowdown of industrial production in the united states as has recently occurred reduces the supply of industrial grades of metal to the metal recycling industry resulting in our having less recyclable metal available to process and market 

we may face risks associated with the implementation of our growth strategy 

our growth strategy subjects us to various risks as part of our growth strategy we may expand existing facilities build additional plants acquire other businesses and metals assets enter into joint 

ventures or form strategic alliances that we believe will complement our existing business these transactions will likely involve some or all of the following risks 

• the difficulty of competing for acquisitions and other growth opportunities with companies having materially greater financial resources than us • the inability to realize anticipated synergies or other benefits expected from an acquisition • the difficulty of integrating the new or acquired operations and personnel into our existing businesses • the potential disruption of ongoing businesses • the diversion of financial resources to new or acquired businesses • the diversion of management attention from other business concerns to new or acquired businesses • the loss of key employees and customers of acquired businesses • the potential exposure to unknown liabilities • the inability of management to maintain uniform standards controls procedures and policies • the difficulty of managing the growth of a larger company • the risk of entering markets in which we have little experience • the risk of becoming involved in labor commercial or regulatory disputes or litigation related to the new or acquired business • the risk of becoming more highly leveraged • the risk of contractual or operational liability to other venture participants or to third parties as a result of our participation • the inability to work efficiently with joint venture or strategic alliance partners and • the difficulties of terminating joint ventures or strategic alliances these transactions might be required for us to remain competitive but we may not be able to complete any such transactions on favorable terms or obtain financing if necessary for such transactions on favorable terms future transactions may not improve our competitive position and business prospects as anticipated and if they do not our sales and earnings may be significantly reduced 

technology operating and startup risks as well as commodity market risks associated with our mesabi nugget ironmaking project may prevent us from realizing its anticipated benefits and could result in a loss of all or a part of our investment 

while we and certain of our current and former joint venture partners built and operated a successful small scale pilot plant on the mesabi iron range in minnesota for the production of a cost effective iron nugget using kobe steels proprietary itmk3® ironmaking process there are technology operational market and startup risks associated with the startup of our worlds first full scale commercial nugget plant utilizing this technology although we believe this full scale plant will be capable of consistently producing highquality iron nuggets for use as a scrap substitute feed stock in our steelmaking operations and in sufficient quantities and at a cost that will compare favorably with the cost of steel scrap and other more conventional scrap substitute products including pig iron there can be no assurance that these expectations will be achieved we have encountered and may from time to time encounter cost overruns systems or process difficulties or quality control problems or output 

restrictions as a result our capital costs could increase the expected cost benefits from the development of this iron nugget product could be diminished or lost and we could lose all or a substantial portion of our investment in the project we could also encounter commodity market risk if during a sustained period the cost to manufacture the nuggets is greater than projected or if the relative market price of scrap and other scrap substitutes for which this iron nugget product is intended as a lower cost substitute is lower than projected which could render our nuggets noneconomical moreover we are undertaking certain ancillary ventures related to the ironmaking process such as our nearby mesabi mining facility for which we have been and are continuing to seek operating permits to allow us to mine taconite ore for use in the production of nuggets mining is a business in which we have no previous experience and which is also subject to possible permitting and environmental risks and uncertainties 

we are subject to litigation which could adversely affect our profitability 

we are involved in various routine litigation matters including administrative proceedings regulatory proceedings governmental investigations environmental matters and commercial and construction contract disputes we are also involved along with eight other steel manufacturing companies in a class action antitrust complaint filed in federal court in chicago illinois that alleges a conspiracy to fix raise maintain and stabilize the price at which steel products were sold in the united states starting in 2005 by artificially restricting the supply of such steel products all but one of the complaints purport to be brought on behalf of a class consisting of all direct purchasers of steel products the other complaint purports to be brought on behalf of a class consisting of all indirect purchasers of steel products within the same time period in addition on december 28 2010 we and the other codefendants were served with a substantially similar complaint in the circuit court of cocke county tennessee purporting to be on behalf of indirect purchasers of steel products in tennessee the case has been removed to federal court all complaints seek treble damages and costs including reasonable attorney fees pre and postjudgment interest and injunctive relief in january 2009 steel dynamics and the other defendants filed a joint motion to dismiss all of the direct purchaser lawsuits in june 2009 however the court denied the motion following a period of discovery relating to the issue of class certification plaintiffs in may 2012 filed their motion for class certification and the parties are currently engaged in the briefing process relating to that issue due to the uncertain nature of litigation we cannot presently determine the ultimate outcome of this litigation 

although not presently necessary or appropriate to make a dollar estimate of exposure to loss if any in connection with the above matter we may in the future determine that a loss accrual is necessary although we may make loss accruals if and as warranted any amounts that we may accrue from time to time could vary significantly from the amounts we actually pay due to inherent uncertainties and the inherent shortcomings of the estimation process the uncertainties involved in litigation and other factors additionally an adverse result could have a material effect on our financial condition results of operations and liquidity 

unexpected equipment downtime or shutdowns could adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations or prospects 

interruptions in our production capabilities could adversely affect our production costs products available for sale and earnings during the affected period in addition to equipment failures our facilities are also subject to the risk of catastrophic loss due to unanticipated events such as fires explosions or violent weather conditions our manufacturing processes are dependent upon critical pieces of steelmaking equipment such as our furnaces continuous casters and rolling equipment as well as electrical equipment such as transformers this equipment may on occasion be out of service as a result of unanticipated failures or other events we have experienced and may in the future experience material plant shutdowns or periods of reduced production as a result of such equipment 

failures or other events these disruptions could have an adverse effect on our operations customer service levels and financial results 

governmental agencies may refuse to grant or renew some of our licenses and permits 

we must receive licenses permits and approvals from state and local governments to conduct certain of our operations such as our mesabi mining operations or to develop or acquire new facilities governmental agencies sometimes resist the establishment of certain types of facilities in their communities including scrap metal collection and processing facilities there can be no assurance that future approvals licenses and permits will be granted or that we will be able to maintain and renew the approvals licenses and permits we currently hold and failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition

operating statement classifications 

net sales net sales from our operations are a factor of volumes shipped product mix and related pricing we charge premium prices for certain grades of steel product dimensions certain smaller volumes and for valueadded processing or coating of the steel products except for our steel fabrication operations segment we recognize revenue from sales and the allowance for estimated returns from these sales at the time the title of the product is transferred to the customer provision is made for estimated product returns and customer claims based on estimates and actual historical experience net sales from steel fabrication operations are recognized from construction contracts utilizing a percentageofcompletion method which is based on the percentage of steel consumed to date as compared to the estimated total steel required for each contract 

costs of goods sold our costs of goods sold represent all direct and indirect costs associated with the manufacture of our products the principal elements of these costs are scrap and scrap substitutes which represent the most significant single component of our consolidated costs of goods sold steel direct and indirect labor and related benefits alloys zinc transportation and freight repairs and maintenance utilities most notably electricity and natural gas and depreciation 

selling general and administrative expenses selling general and administrative expenses consist of all costs associated with our sales finance and accounting and administrative departments these 

costs include among other items labor and related benefits professional services insurance premiums property taxes profit sharing and amortization of intangible and other assets 

interest expense net of capitalized interest interest expense consists of interest associated with our senior credit facilities and other debt net of interest costs that are required to be capitalized during the construction period of certain capital investment projects 

other income expense net other income consists of interest income earned on our temporary cash deposits and any other nonoperating income activity including gains on certain shortterm investments and income from nonconsolidated investments accounted for under the equity method other expense consists of any nonoperating costs 

overview 

we are one of the largest steel producers and one of the largest metals recyclers in the united states based on a current estimated annual steelmaking capability of 64 million tons and actual metals recycling shipping volumes during 2012 and 2011 of 56 million gross tons and 59 million gross tons of ferrous materials respectively and 11 billion pounds of nonferrous metals our steel production during 2012 and 2011 excluding the techs was 52 million tons the primary sources of our revenues are from the manufacture and sale of steel products processing and sale of recycled ferrous and nonferrous metals and to a lesser degree fabrication and sale of steel joist and decking products our operations are managed and reported based on three operating segments steel operations metals recycling and ferrous resources operations and steel fabrication operations 

during 2012 we had net sales of 73 billion gross profit of 7199 million 10 and operating income of 3912 million 5 as compared to net sales of 80 billion gross profit of 9315 million 12 and operating income of 5848 million 7 during 2011 and net sales of 63 billion gross profit of 6757 million 11 and operating income of 3648 million 6 during 2010 net income attributable to steel dynamics inc was 1636 million or 073 per diluted share in 2012 compared with 2781 million or 122 per diluted share in 2011 and 1407 million or 064 per diluted share in 2010 

during 2012 operating income declined 33 or 1937 million as compared to 2011 the majority of the decline related to steel operations as operating income for the segment declined 1625 million or 25 year over year the combination of global economic and political uncertainty continued to suppress consumer confidence and dampened global steel demand downward pressure on steel margins arose from a weak us economy resulting in higher raw materials costs on a relative basis to lower selling values caused in part by increased import activity while overall steel volumes remained steady as demand from automotive and manufacturing stayed strong throughout the year and steel conversion costs stayed fairly steady to down metal spread which we define as the difference between average selling prices and the cost of ferrous scrapour primary raw material compressed average 2012 steel prices per ton shipped externally declined 66 while average ferrous scrap consumed for production only declined 32 per ton operating income of our metals recycling and ferrous resources segment decreased in 2012 to a loss of 365 million as compared to income of 266 million in 2011 at omnisource our metals recycling operations within our metals recycling and ferrous resources segment ferrous and nonferrous metals sales volume and pricing decreased as demand weakened compared to 2011 in conjunction with moderate decreases in domestic and international steel mill utilization rates and metal spreads compressed this resulted in margin compression in both ferrous and nonferrous metals that resulted in operating profit at omnisource decreasing 188 million or 28 to 477 million from that of 2011

steel operations 

steel operations steel operations consist of our five electricarc furnace minimills producing steel from steel scrap utilizing continuous casting automated rolling mills and various downstream finishing facilities including the techs operations collectively our steel operations sell directly to end users and service centers these products are used in numerous industry sectors including the automotive construction commercial transportation agriculture and industrial machinery markets during 2012 2011 and 2010 our steel operations accounted for 62 61 and 61 respectively of our external net sales operating income for steel operations decreased 1625 million or 25 to 4956 million in 2012 versus 2011 this decrease is due primarily to reduced gross margins as decreases in average segment selling prices of 64 per ton shipped were only partially offset by 32 per ton decreases in scrap raw material costs 

steel operations shipping volumes for the respective periods were as follows 



sheet products our flat roll division sells a broad range of sheet steel products such as hot rolled cold rolled and coated steel products including a large variety of specialty products such as light gauge hot rolled galvanized galvalume® and painted products the techs operations comprised of three galvanizing lines also sells specialized galvanized sheet steels used in nonautomotive applications sheet products represented 62 of our steel segments shipped tons in 2012 as compared to 64 in 2011 and 68 in 2010 

long products our structural and rail division sells structural steel beams and pilings and is also designed to produce and sell a variety of standard and premiumgrade rail for the railroad industry our engineered bar products division primarily sells special bar quality and merchant bar quality rounds and roundcornered squares our roanoke bar division sells billets and merchant steel products including angles plain rounds flats and channels steel of west virginia primarily sells merchant beams channels and specialty structural steel sections 

net sales for the steel segment decreased in 2012 by 3692 million or 7 compared to 2011 while selling volumes for our steel products were basically flat overall in 2012 compared to 2011 there was a shift in mix to long products from sheet products sheet product shipments decreased 3 in 2012 compared to 2011 while long products increased 4 shipments in 2012 at our structural and rail division increased 17 including a 23 increase in standard rail shipments compared to 2011 to 144000 tons in 2012 as compared to 117000 tons in 2011 although the nonresidential construction market continued to remain slow we saw some improvement in sales and order entry at our structural and rail division in 2012 as compared to 2011 residential construction has also clearly improved domestically which is positive for the nonresidential construction industry as it is a leading indicator for the sector we continue to realize market share gains in rail and plan to further expand standard rail shipments in 2013 sales volume at our engineered bar division decreased 16 in 2012 versus those in 2011 while the automotive and manufacturing sectors remained strong transportation and heavy equipment softened as overexuberant build rates early in 2012 resulted in oversupply even though end markets remain mixed we believe there is additional momentum that could be seen in 2013 related to both the automotive and manufacturing 

our 2012 average steel operations segment selling price per ton shipped including intracompany shipments decreased 64 compared with 2011 sheet products 2012 average selling price per ton shipped decreased 81 compared with 2011 as the robust market in the first half of 2011 was not repeated in 2012 and long products average selling prices decreased 42 per ton compared with 2011 

steel operations average selling prices and volumes 

metallic raw materials used in our electric arc furnaces represent our single most significant manufacturing cost our metallic raw material cost per net ton consumed in our steel operations decreased 32 in 2012 compared with 2011 during 2012 2011 and 2010 respectively our metallic raw material costs represented 66 68 and 62 of our steel operations manufacturing costs excluding the operations of the techs which purchases rather than produces the steel it further processes 

metals recycling and ferrous resources operations 

metals recycling and ferrous resources operations this operating segment primarily includes our metals recycling operations omnisource our liquid pig iron production facility iron dynamics idi and our minnesota iron operations our metals recycling and ferrous resources operations segment accounted for 32 35 and 35 of our external net sales in 2012 2011 and 2010 respectively operating income for the metals recycling and ferrous resources operations segment decreased 631 million in 2012 to a loss of 365 million 

metals recycling and ferrous resources shipping volumes during the respective periods were as follows 



metals recycling our metals recycling operations omnisource represent our metals sourcing and processing operations and are the most significant source of revenues and earnings in this segment these operations sell ferrous metals to steel mills and foundries and nonferrous metals such as copper brass aluminum and stainless steel to among others ingot manufacturers copper refineries and mills smelters and specialty mills our metals recycling operations represented 94 95 and 96 of this segments net sales during 2012 2011 and 2010 and 477 million 664 million and 657 million of this segments operating income for these same periods respectively 

during 2012 metals recycling recorded sales of 34 billion on shipments of 56 million gross tons of ferrous metals and 105 billion pounds of nonferrous metals compared with sales of 39 billion on shipments of 59 million gross tons of ferrous and 107 billion pounds of nonferrous metals during 2011 sales prices of ferrous and nonferrous metals both decreased 11 in 2012 versus 2011 the decreased volume and pricing of our ferrous metals is directly impacted by the weakening of both domestic and global steel mill utilization during the year during 2012 the metals recycling operations provided approximately 51 of the steel scrap purchased by our steel mills this represented 46 of the metals recycling operations ferrous shipments for 2012 while similar amounts were 43 for 2011 and 42 for 2010 

metals recycling operating income decreased 188 million to 477 million in 2012 as compared to 2011 decreased exports of ferrous scrap along with moderating domestic steel mill utilization rates resulted in selling prices declining more so than did the cost of acquired scrap and thus scrap metal margins compressed during 2012 versus those in 2011 negatively impacting gross 

margin and operating income nonferrous selling volumes and metal spreads decreased slightly in 2012 versus those in 2011 

ferrous resources our ferrous resource operations consist of our two ironmaking initiatives iron dynamics idi a liquid pig iron production facility and our minnesota iron operations consisting of an iron nugget production facility and planned operations to supply the nugget facility with its primary raw material iron concentrate idi primarily produces liquid pig iron which is used as a scrap substitute raw material input exclusively at our flat roll division our minnesota iron operations consists of mesabi nugget owned 81 by us our planned future iron mining operations which is currently in the permitting process mesabi mining and our iron tailings operations mining resources owned 80 by us the construction of the mesabi nugget facility was completed in 2009 and initial production of iron nuggets commenced january 2010 since that time we have continued to refine this pioneering production process and changed equipment configurations to increase production improve quality and increase plant availability a planned sixweek outage in the fall of 2012 was used to complete the groundwork necessary for the implementation of further improvements expected to be made in the first half of 2013 these modifications are expected to improve both volume and product quality the facilitys designed annual production capacity is 500000 metric tons in 2012 2011 and 2010 mesabi nugget produced and shipped 169000 160000 and 67000 metric tons of ironnuggets respectively for use by our own steel mills our iron tailings operation mining resources started operations in the fourth quarter of 2012 and expects to be at full capacity during the first half of 2013 this operation provides iron ore tailings to be concentrated for use by mesabi nugget as lowcost iron concentrate in the nugget production process this is critical to our minnesota operations as we will now be able to benefit from iron concentrate costing of less than 50 per metric ton compared to market pricing which is currently in excess of 140 per metric ton we expect to see this benefit beginning in the second quarter of 2013 

losses from our minnesota iron operations reduced our net income in 2012 and 2011 by approximately 415 million and 340 million respectively compared to approximately 273 million in 2010 when the location commissioned initial startup the increased losses in 2012 were due to the continued startup efforts and decreased market selling prices in 2012 as pig iron market prices price index used to determine selling prices decreased in addition our idi operations operating income decreased 174 million or 57 compared to 2011 due to decreased selling prices as pig iron market prices price index used to determine selling prices decreased 

steel fabrication operations 

our steel fabrication operations represent the companys new millennium building systems plants located throughout the united states and northern mexico revenues from these plants are generated from the fabrication of trusses girders steel joists and steel decking used within the nonresidential construction industry steel fabrication operations accounted for 5 3 and 3 of our external net sales during 2012 2011 and 2010 respectively the operating income for the segment was 21 million in 2012 compared to a loss of 66 million in 2011 and a loss of 123 million in 2010 excluding a 128 million impairment charge 

net sales for the segment increased by 950 million or 34 in 2012 compared to 2011 as our selling volumes increased 35 to 295000 tons in 2012 and our average steel fabrication operations selling price per ton shipped decreased 11 or 1 in 2012 as compared to 2011 our volume growth can be attributed to some modest growth within the nonresidential construction market as a whole our organic gains in market share as well as our expansion into the south and southwest during 2011 residential construction has also clearly improved domestically which is positive for the nonresidential construction industry as it is a leading indicator for the sector the architectural billings index has remained above the 500 threshold for the last five consecutive months in 2012—a positive indicator for future building activity we are well positioned to grow with our expanded national footprint as we anticipate continuing to develop our market presence and penetration in the western portion of the united states and further leverage improvements in the productivity and efficiency we realized in 2012 

the purchase of various steel products is the largest single cost of goods sold item for our steel fabrication operations during 2012 2011 and 2010 the cost of steel products purchased represented 70 of the total cost of manufacturing for our steel fabrication operations while the cost of steel decreased in 2012 as compared to 2011 by 28 per ton as the decrease in input costs outpaced the decrease in selling prices and sales volume increased the segments gross profit increased 166 million or 58 in 2012 versus 2011

consolidated results 2012 vs 2011 

selling general and administrative expense sga selling general and administrative expenses including profit sharing and amortization of intangible assets were 3205 million during 2012 as compared to 3467 million during 2011 a decrease of 262 million or 8 during each of 2012 and 2011 selling general and administrative expenses represented approximately 4 of net sales the decrease in sga expenses in 2012 compared to 2011 relates primarily to decreased profit sharing and incentive compensation expenses which together were 340 million more in 2011 than in 2012 in conjunction with our higher profitability during 2011 amortization of intangible assets decreased 44 million or 11 during 2012 compared to 2011 due to the accelerated amortization methods used for intangible assets related to customer and scrap generator relationships 

impairment charges in the third quarter of 2012 we determined that we would terminate two small joint venture entities which were not aligned with our longterm strategic focus the decision to terminate these joint ventures triggered an assessment for impairment based on estimated realizable 

values resulting in an impairment charge of 83 million being recorded as these joint ventures are not reported within any of our reportable segments reported segment results are not affected 

interest expense net of capitalized interest during 2012 gross interest expense decreased 187 million or 10 to 1600 million and capitalized interest decreased 336000 or 19 to 14 million as compared to 2011 gross interest expense decreased in 2012 as a result of our paying down 175 million in longterm debt primarily in the third quarter of 2012 in conjunction with a refinancing of our longterm debt during 2012 which also served to reduce our overall cost of debt and extend our overall maturity schedule 

other income expense net other expense net was 285 million during 2012 as compared to income of 165 million during 2011 with interest income of 47 million in 2012 versus 45 million in 2011 the refinancing activity during 2012 resulted in the company recording expenses of 403 million related to tender and call premiums write off of unamortized debt issuance costs loss on early extinguishment of debt and tender expenses which are reflected in other expenses in 2012 

income taxes during 2012 our income tax expense was 618 million as compared to 1586 million during 2011 our effective income tax rate before noncontrolling interests was 303 and 374 during 2012 and 2011 respectively the lower effective income tax rate in 2012 is due primarily to the impact of reductions in our unrecognized tax positions due to tax audit settlements in 2012 which reduced our effective tax rate by 96 this benefit was partially offset by an increase of the negative impact on the effective tax rate of larger noncontrolling interest losses on the lower 2012 pretax income 

included in the 222 million balance of unrecognized tax benefits at december 31 2012 are potential benefits of 95 million that if recognized would affect the effective tax rate in addition to the unrecognized tax benefits we had 62 million accrued for the payment of interest and penalties at december 31 2012 we recognize interest and penalties related to our tax contingencies on a netoftax basis in income tax expense during 2012 we recognized benefits from the reduction of interest expense of 59 million net of tax and benefits from the reduction of penalties of 413000 

we file income tax returns in the us federal jurisdiction as well as income tax returns in various state jurisdictions the internal revenue service irs has completed its examinations of the years 2004 through 2009 and has effectively settled those years with the company the irs is currently examining our federal income tax returns for the years 2010 and 2011 at this time we do not believe there will be any significant examination adjustments that would result in a material change to our financial position or results of operations it is reasonably possible that the amount of unrecognized tax benefits could change in the next twelve months as a result of these state and federal income tax audits based on the current audits in process the payment of taxes as a result of audit settlements could be in an amount from zero to 126 million by the end of 2013 with few exceptions we are no longer subject to federal state and local income tax examinations by tax authorities for years ended before 2009 

consolidated results 2011 vs 2010 

during 2011 we had net sales of 80 billion gross profit of 9315 million 12 and operating income of 5848 million 7 as compared to net sales of 63 billion gross profit of 6757 million 11 and operating income of 3648 million 6 during 2010 net income attributable to steel dynamics inc was 2781 million or 122 per diluted share in 2011 compared with 1407 million or 064 per diluted share in 2010 

during 2011 as the domestic economy continued to show signs of improvement we experienced further increased sales volumes and pricing resulting in increased gross profit across all reporting segments in comparison to 2010 steel operations experienced overall improved customer order volume 

and pricing with the most impactful demand improvements in 2011 as in 2010 in our sheet and special barquality steel products as the automotive transportation industrial and agricultural and construction equipment markets continued to strengthen steel operations shipping volumes improved 9 and overall steel pricing increased 16 on a per ton basis resulting in 2011 operating profit from steel operations increasing over that of 2010 by 50 to 6581 million operating income of our metals recycling ferrous resources segment increased in 2011 to 266 million as compared to 197 million in 2010 at omnisource ferrous and nonferrous metals sales volume and pricing increased as demand continued to improve in 2011 in conjunction with increases in domestic and international steel mill utilization rates and other production increases however there was margin percentage compression in both ferrous and nonferrous metals that offset much of the sales volume and pricing gains resulting in operating profit at omnisource increasing slightly in 2011 compared to 2010 

selling general and administrative expense sga selling general and administrative expenses including profit sharing and amortization of intangible assets were 3467 million during 2011 as compared to 2981 million during 2010 an increase of 486 million or 16 during 2011 and 2010 selling general and administrative expenses represented approximately 4 and 5 of net sales respectively the percentage decrease is primarily a result of increased net sales in 2011 compared with the prior year as measured against certain fixed cost components in selling general and administrative expenses the increase in sga expenses in 2011 compared to 2010 relates primarily to increased profit sharing expenses and incentive compensation which together were 368 million more in 2011 than in 2010 in conjunction with companys increased profitability during 2011 amortization of intangible assets decreased 56 million or 12 during 2011 compared to 2010 due to the accelerated amortization methods used for intangible assets related to customer and scrap generator relationships 

interest expense net of capitalized interest during 2011 gross interest expense increased 15 million or 1 to 1787 million and capitalized interest decreased 52 million or 75 to 17 million as compared to 2010 the interest capitalization that occurred during these periods resulted from the interest required to be capitalized with respect to construction activities at our various operating segments which were not as significant in 2011 

other income expense net other income net was 165 million during 2011 as compared to 189 million during 2010 with interest income of 45 million in 2011 versus 41 million in 2010 

income taxes during 2011 our income tax expense was 1586 million as compared to 839 million during 2010 our effective income tax rate before noncontrolling interests was 374 and 393 during 2011 and 2010 respectively the lower effective income tax rate in 2011 is due primarily to additional permanent deductible items in 2011 and a reduction of the negative impact of noncontrolling interest losses due to the higher 2011 income 

liquidity and capital resources 

our business is capital intensive and requires substantial expenditures for among other things the purchase and maintenance of equipment used in our steelmaking and finishing operations and metals recycling and ferrous resources operations and to remain in compliance with environmental laws our shortterm and longterm liquidity needs arise primarily from capital expenditures working capital requirements principal and interest payments related to our outstanding indebtedness and dividends 

we have met these liquidity requirements with cash provided by operations issuances of common stock and longterm borrowings our availability at december 31 2012 is as follows 



working capital cash flow from operations of 4457 million was driven mainly by net income plus noncash items such as depreciation and amortization deferred taxes and equitybased compensation during 2012 our operational working capital position representing amounts invested in trade receivables and inventories less current liabilities other than income taxes payable and debt increased 48 million to 13 billion compared to december 31 2011 trade receivables of which over 98 were current or less than 60 days past due decreased 804 million or 11 during 2012 to 6424 million our largest customer is an affiliated company heidtman steel which represented 6 of our outstanding trade receivables at december 31 2012 and 5 at december 31 2011 trade receivables decreased during 2012 due to decreased sales from lower sales levels late in the fourth quarter of 2012 as compared to the fourth quarter of 2011 and days sales outstanding has decreased slightly total inventories increased in 2012 by 29 million or less than 1 to 12 billion at december 31 2012 scrap inventory decreased 85 million in total in 2012 as decreases in ferrous scrap volume and cost were largely offset by increases in nonferrous volume and cost most notably copper workinprocess and finished goods inventories decreased 91 million with steel volumes relatively unchanged our trade payables decreased 607 million or 14 and general accruals decreased 216 million during 2012 the decrease in trade payables is a reflection of the decreased production activities and commodity raw material pricing and purchasing prior to december 31 2012 compared to that at december 31 2011 the decrease in general accruals is due primarily to the decreases in accrued profit sharing and incentive compensation due to the decreased profitability during 2012 when compared to 2011 

capital investments during 2012 we invested 2235 million in property plant and equipment of which 558 million was within our steel operations and 1598 million related to our metals recycling and ferrous resource operations which included 606 million related to the construction of mining resources which started up operations late in 2012 we believe these capital investments will benefit our net sales and related cash flows as each project reaches completion and attains appropriate operational metrics our current estimated 2013 cash allocation plan includes the investment of between 2000 and 2250 million in capital expenditures in our existing and announced operations 

capital resources and longterm debt during 2012 our total outstanding debt decreased 1779 million to 22 billion our total longterm debt to capitalization ratio representing our longterm debt including current maturities divided by the sum of our longterm debt redeemable noncontrolling interest and total stockholders equity was 471 at december 31 2012 as compared to 501 at december 31 2011 

on january 11 2012 we expanded our senior secured credit facility by adding a 2750 million term loan that matures on september 30 2016 term loan we used the net proceeds of the term loan together with available cash to fund the january 2012 purchase pursuant to a tender offer of 2797 million plus accrued interest of our 7 3  8  senior notes due 2012 on august 16 2012 we issued 4000 million of 6 1  8  senior notes due 2019 2019 senior notes and 3500 million of 6 3  8  senior notes due 2022 2022 senior notes a portion of the net proceeds from the issuance of the 2019 and 2022 senior notes were used to fund the august 16 2012 purchase of another 622 million plus accrued interest of our 7 3  8  senior notes due 2012 pursuant to a tender offer a further portion of these proceeds were used to fund the august 16 2012 purchase pursuant to a tender offer 

of 4105 million plus accrued interest of our 7 3  4  senior notes due 2016 and the august 31 2012 redemption of the then remaining 895 million plus accrued interest outstanding 7 3  4  senior notes due 2016 the remaining proceeds from the issuance of the 2019 and 2022 senior notes along with available cash were used for the september 28 2012 extinguishment of the then remaining 3581 million plus accrued interest through the november 1 2012 maturity date outstanding 7 3  8  senior notes due 2012 

at the conclusion of this refinancing activity all 7000 million of the 7 3  8  senior notes due 2012 were paid off as was all 5000 million of the 7 3  4  senior notes due 2016 and new debt was issued in the form of the 2750 million term loan due 2016 the 4000 million 6 1  8  senior notes due 2019 and the 3500 million 6 3  8  senior notes due 2022 as a result of the refinancing activity overall outstanding longterm debt was reduced by 1750 million our longterm debt maturity profile was extended and the overall cost of debt was reduced 

the refinancing activity during 2012 resulted in us recording expenses of 403 million related to tender and call premiums write off of unamortized debt issuance costs loss on early extinguishment of debt and tender expenses which are reflected in other expenses in the consolidated statement of income for the year ended december 31 2012 

we have a senior secured credit facility facility that matures in september 2016 which provides for a 11 billion revolver revolver subject to certain conditions we have the opportunity to increase the revolver capacity by an additional 1250 million as noted above the facility was expanded in january 2012 by adding a 2750 million term loan the facility is guaranteed by certain of our subsidiaries and is secured by substantially all of our accounts receivable and inventories and pledges of shares of our wholly owned subsidiaries capital stock the revolver is available to fund working capital capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes 

the outstanding balance on the revolver must be the lesser of 11 billion less other applicable commitments such as letters of credit and other secured debt as defined within the facility or the sum of 85 of our eligible accounts receivable and 65 of our eligible inventories less other applicable commitments at december 31 2012 we had 11 billion of availability on the revolver 140 million of outstanding letters of credit and other obligations which reduce availability and there were no borrowings outstanding 

the facility contains financial covenants and other covenants that limit or restrict our ability to make capital expenditures incur indebtedness permit liens on property enter into transactions with affiliates make restricted payments or investments enter into mergers acquisitions or consolidations conduct asset sales pay dividends or distributions and enter into other specified transactions and activities our ability to borrow funds within the terms of the revolver is dependent upon our continued compliance with the financial and other covenants 

the financial covenants under our facility state that we must maintain an interest coverage ratio of not less than 250100 our interest coverage ratio is calculated by dividing our lasttwelve trailing months ltm consolidated adjusted ebitda earnings before interest taxes depreciation amortization and certain other noncash transactions as allowed in our facility by our ltm gross interest expense less amortization of financing fees in addition a net debt as defined in the facility to consolidated ltm adjusted ebitda ratio leverage ratio of not more than 500100 must be maintained if the net debt to ebitda ratio exceeds 350100 at any time our ability to make restricted payments as defined in the credit agreement which includes cash dividends to stockholders and share purchases among other things is limited at december 31 2012 our interest coverage ratio and net debt leverage ratio were 405100 and 293100 respectively we were therefore in compliance with these covenants at december 31 2012 and we anticipate we will remain in compliance during 2013 

cash dividends we declared cash dividends of 877 million or 040 per common share 010 per common share each quarter during 2012 and 875 million or 040 per common share 010 per common share per quarter during 2011 we paid cash dividends of 876 million and 819 million during 2012 and 2011 respectively our board of directors along with executive management approves the payment of dividends on a quarterly basis the determination to pay cash dividends in the future will be at the discretion of our board of directors after taking into account various factors including our financial condition results of operations outstanding indebtedness current and anticipated cash needs and growth plans in addition the terms of our senior secured revolving credit agreement and the indentures relating to our senior notes restrict the amount of cash dividends we can pay 

other our ability to meet our debt service obligations and reduce our total debt will depend upon our future performance which in turn will depend upon general economic financial and business conditions along with competition legislation and regulatory factors that are largely beyond our control in addition we cannot assure you that our operating results cash flow access to credit markets and capital resources will be sufficient for repayment of our indebtedness in the future we believe that based upon current levels of operations and anticipated growth cash flow from operations together with other available sources of funds including additional borrowings under our senior secured credit facility through its term which expires in september 2016 will be adequate for the next twelve months for making required payments of principal and interest on our indebtedness funding working capital requirements and anticipated capital expenditures 

during 2012 we received benefits from state and local governments in the form of real estate and personal property tax abatements and credits of approximately 49 million based on our current abatements and incentive credits and utilizing our existing longlived asset structure we estimate the remaining annual benefit to our future operations to be approximately 43 million 28 million 24 million 12 million and 840000 during the years 2013 through 2017 respectively and 908000 in total thereafter 

contractual obligations and other longterm liabilities 

we have the following minimum commitments under contractual obligations including purchase obligations as defined by the us securities and exchange commission a purchase obligation is defined as an agreement to purchase goods or services that is enforceable and legally binding and that specifies all significant terms including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased fixed minimum or variable price provisions and the approximate timing of the transaction other longterm liabilities are defined as longterm liabilities that are reflected on our balance sheet under generally accepted accounting principles based on this definition the following table includes only those contracts which include fixed or minimum obligations it does not include normal purchases which are made in the 

ordinary course of business the following table provides aggregated information about outstanding contractual obligations and other longterm liabilities as of december 31 2012 in thousands 



1 the longterm debt payment information presented above assumes that our term loan senior notes and convertible senior notes remain outstanding until maturity refer to note 2 to the consolidated financial statements elsewhere in this report for additional information regarding these transactions and our longterm debt 2 the estimated interest payments shown above assume interest rates of 21 variable rate at december 31 2012 on the 2750 million term loan issued january 2012 maturing in september 2016 5125 on our 2875 million convertible senior notes due june 2014 6 3  4  on our 5000 million senior unsecured notes due april 2015 6 1  8  on our 4000 million senior unsecured notes due august 2019 7 5  8  on our 3500 million senior unsecured notes due march 2020 6 3  8  on our 3500 million senior unsecured notes due august 2022 040 commitment fee on our available senior secured revolver and an average of 49 on our other debt of 535 million 3 purchase obligations include commitments we have for the purchase of electricity fuel iron concentrate natural gas and its transportation and zinc these arrangements have take or pay or other similar commitment provisions we have utilized such take or pay requirements during the past three years under these contracts 4 construction commitments relate to firm contracts we have with various vendors for the completion of certain construction projects at our various divisions at december 31 2012 5 other commitments principally relate to certain pension and deferred compensation plan obligations 6 we expect to make cash outlays in the future related to our unrecognized tax benefits however due to the uncertainty of the timing we are unable to make reasonably reliable estimates regarding the period of cash settlement with the respective taxing authorities accordingly unrecognized tax benefits and related interest and penalties of 284 million as of december 31 2012 have been excluded from the contractual obligations table above refer to note 3 to the consolidated financial statements elsewhere in this report for additional information 

other matters 

inflation 

we believe that inflation has not had a material effect on our results of operations 

environmental and other contingencies 

we have incurred and in the future will continue to incur capital expenditures and operating expenses for matters relating to environmental control remediation monitoring and compliance during 2012 we incurred costs related to the monitoring and compliance of environmental matters in the amount of approximately 377 million and capital expenditures related to environmental compliance of approximately 538000 over 78 of the costs incurred during 2012 for monitoring and compliance were related to the normal transportation of certain types of waste produced in the steelmaking process in accordance with legal requirements we incurred combined environmental remediation costs of approximately 138000 at all of our facilities during 2012 we have an accrual of 18 million net of 745000 of escrowed funds recorded for environmental remediation related to our metals recycling operations and 29 million related to minnesota operations we believe apart from our dependence on environmental construction and operating permits for our existing and proposed manufacturing facilities that compliance with current environmental laws and regulations is not likely to have a materially adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or liquidity however environmental laws and regulations have changed rapidly in recent years and we may become subject to more stringent environmental laws and regulations in the future such as the impact of united states government or various governmental agencies introducing regulatory changes in response to the potential of climate change 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

managements discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states we review the accounting policies we use in reporting our financial results on a regular basis the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent liabilities we evaluate the appropriateness of these estimations and judgments on an ongoing basis we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources results may differ from these estimates due to actual outcomes being different from those on which we based our assumptions we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 

revenue recognition and allowance for doubtful accounts except for our steel fabrication operations segment we recognize revenues from sales and the allowance for estimated returns from these sales when the title of the product transfers provision is made for estimated product returns and customer claims based on historical experience if the historical data used in our estimates does not reflect future returns and claims trends additional provision may be necessary our steel fabrication operations segment recognizes revenues from construction contracts using a percentage of completion methodology based on steel tons used on completed units to date as a percentage of estimated total steel tons required by each contract steel fabrication operations accounted for 5 3 and 3 of our net sales in 2012 2011 and 2010 respectively 

we are exposed to credit risk in the event of nonpayment by our customers which in steel operations are principally intermediate steel processors and service centers that sell our products to 

numerous industry sectors including the automotive agriculture construction commercial transportation and industrial machinery markets our metals recycling operations sell ferrous metals to steel mills and foundries and nonferrous metals such as copper brass aluminum and stainless steel to among others ingot manufacturers copper refineries and mills smelters and specialty mills we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments based on known credit risks historical loss experience and current economic conditions affecting our customers we mitigate our exposure to credit risk by performing ongoing credit evaluations and taking further action when necessary such as requiring letters of credit or other security interests to support the receivable from our customer if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate resulting in the impairment of their ability to make payments additional allowance may be required 

inventories we record inventories at lower of cost or market cost is determined using a weighted average cost method for scrap and on a firstin firstout basis for other inventory we record amounts required if any to reduce the carrying value of inventory to its net realizable value as a charge to cost of goods sold if steel selling prices were to decline in future periods writedown of inventory could result specifically raw material inventory such as scrap purchased during periods of peak market pricing 

impairments of longlived tangible and finitelived intangible assets we review longlived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable impairment losses are recorded on longlived assets used in operations when indicators of impairment are present and the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than the assets carrying amounts the impairment loss is measured by comparing the fair value of the asset to its carrying amount we consider various factors and determine whether an impairment test is necessary including by way of examples a significant and prolonged deterioration in operating results and projected cash flows significant changes in the extent or manner in which an asset is used technological advances with respect to assets which would potentially render them obsolete our strategy and capital planning and the economic climate in markets to be served when determining future cash flows and if necessary fair value we must make judgments as to the expected utilization of assets and estimated future cash flows related to those assets we consider historical and anticipated future results general economic and market conditions the impact of planned business and operational strategies and all available information at the time the estimates are made those estimates and judgments may or may not ultimately prove appropriate 

in the third quarter of 2012 we determined that we would terminate two small joint venture entities which were not aligned with our longterm strategic focus the decision to terminate these joint ventures triggered an assessment for impairment based on estimated realizable values resulting in an impairment charge of 83 million being recorded as these joint ventures are not reported within any of our reportable segments reported segment results are not affected 

after the purchase of additional fabrication assets in the fourth quarter of 2010 and determining the future use of existing fabrication facilities the company determined that the carrying value of certain fixed assets at its idled south carolina fabrication facility exceeded their fair value as determined utilizing market and cost approaches the resulting impairment charge of 128 million was recorded within the steel fabrications reporting segment in 2010 

goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets 

our goodwill relates to various business combinations and is allocated to the following reporting units at december 31in thousands 



at least once annually or when indicators of impairment exist we perform an impairment test for goodwill goodwill is allocated to various reporting units which are generally one level below our operating segments we utilize a twostepped approach to measuring goodwill impairment the first step of the test determines if there is potential goodwill impairment in this step we compare the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying amount which includes goodwill the fair value of the reporting unit is determined by using an estimate of future cash flows utilizing a riskadjusted discount rate to calculate the net present value of future cash flows income approach and by using a market approach based upon an analysis of valuation metrics of comparable peer companies if the carrying amount exceeds the fair value we perform the second step of the test which measures the amount of impairment loss to be recorded if any in the second step we compare the carrying amount of the goodwill to the implied fair value of the goodwill based on the net fair value of the recognized and unrecognized assets and liabilities of the reporting unit if the implied fair value is less than the carrying value an impairment loss is recorded to the extent that the fair value of the goodwill is less than its carrying value 

key assumptions used to determine the estimated fair value of each reporting unit under the discounted cash flows method income approach include a expected cash flows for the fiveyear period following the testing date including market share sales volumes and prices costs to produce and estimated capital needs b an estimated terminal value using a terminal year growth rate determined based on the growth prospects of the reporting unit and c a discount rate based on managements best estimate of the aftertax weighted average cost of capital key assumptions used to determine the estimated fair value of each reporting unit under the market approach include the expected revenues and cash flows in the next year we consider historical and anticipated future results general economic and market conditions the impact of planned business and operational strategies and all available information at the time the fair values of its reporting units are estimated those estimates and judgments may or may not ultimately prove appropriate 

goodwill and other intangible assets acquired in recent transactions are naturally more susceptible to impairment primarily due to the fact that they are recorded at fair value based on recent operating plans and economic conditions present at the time of acquisition consequently if operating results andor economic conditions deteriorate shortly after an acquisition it could result in the impairment of the acquired assets a deterioration of economic conditions may not only negatively impact the estimated operating cash flows used in our cash flow models but may also negatively impact other assumptions used in our analyses including but not limited to the estimated cost of capital andor discount rates additionally we are required to ensure that assumptions used to determine fair value in our analyses are consistent with the assumptions a hypothetical marketplace participant would use as a result the cost of capital andor discount rates used in our analyses may increase or decrease based on market conditions and trends regardless of whether our actual cost of capital has changed therefore we may recognize an impairment of an intangible asset or assets in spite of realizing actual cash flows that are approximately equal to or greater than our previously forecasted amounts 

our other indefinitelived intangible assets relate to trademarks acquired through various business combinations and is allocated to the following reporting units at december 31 2012 and 2011 in thousands 



at least annually or when indicators of impairment exist we perform an impairment test for indefinitelived intangible assets through the comparison of the fair value of the specific intangible asset with its carrying amount the fair value of the intangible asset is determined by using an estimate of future cash flows attributable to the asset and a riskadjusted discount rate to compute a net present value of future cash flows if the fair value is less than the carrying value an impairment loss is recorded in an amount equal to the excess in carrying value 

our fourth quarter 2012 annual goodwill and indefinitelived intangible asset impairment analyses did not result in any impairment charges management does not believe that it is reasonably likely that our reporting units will fail step one of a goodwill impairment test in the near term the omnisource reporting units fair value exceeded its carrying value by approximately 13 however our analysis contemplates performance improvements similar to historical levels and certain organic growth initiatives the discount rate used in the analysis is a critical assumption one in which a minor change can have a significant impact on the estimated fair value a more than 100 basis point increase in the discount rate used in the omnisource analysis would not result in an impairment charge for the reporting unit we will continue to monitor operating results within all reporting units throughout the upcoming year in an effort to determine if events and circumstances warrant further interim impairment testing otherwise all reporting units will again be subject to the required annual impairment test during the fourth quarter of 2013 changes in judgments and estimates underlying our analysis of goodwill for possible impairment including expected future operating cash flows and discount rate could decrease the estimated fair value of our reporting units in the future and could result in an impairment of goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets 

income taxes we are required to estimate our income taxes as a part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements this requires us to estimate our actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatments of items for tax and accounting purposes these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities which are included within our consolidated balance sheet we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely we must establish a valuation allowance we establish reserves to reduce some or all of the tax benefit of any of our tax positions at the time we determine that the positions become uncertain we adjust these reserves including any impact on the related interest and penalties in light of changing facts and circumstances such as the progress of a tax audit a number of years may elapse before a particular matter for which we have established a reserve is audited by a taxing authority and finally resolved the number of years with open tax audits varies depending on the tax jurisdiction the tax benefit that has been previously reserved because of a failure to meet the more likely than not recognition threshold would be recognized in our income tax expense in the first interim period when the uncertainty disappears settlement of any particular issue would usually require the use of cash 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

market risk 

in the normal course of business we are exposed to interest rate changes our objectives in managing exposure to interest rate changes are to limit the impact of these rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower overall borrowing costs to achieve these objectives we primarily use interest rate swaps to manage net exposure to interest rate changes related to our portfolio of borrowings 

the following table represents the principal cash repayments and related weightedaverage interest rates by maturity date for our longterm debt as of december 31 2012 in thousands 



commodity risk 

in the normal course of business we are exposed to the market risk and price fluctuations related to the sale of our products and to the purchase of raw materials used in our operations such as metallic raw materials electricity natural gas iron concentrate fuel and zinc our risk strategy associated with product sales has generally been to obtain competitive prices for our products and to allow operating results to reflect market price movements dictated by supply and demand 

our risk strategy associated with the purchase of raw materials utilized within our operations has generally been to make some commitments with suppliers relating to future expected requirements for some commodities such as electricity natural gas and its transportation fuel and zinc certain of these commitments contain provisions which require us to take or pay for specified quantities without regard to actual usage for periods of up to 42 months for physical commodity requirements and for up to 8 years for commodity transportation requirements our commitments for these arrangements with take or pay or other similar commitment provisions for the years ending december 31 are as follows in thousands 



we utilized such take or pay requirements during the past three years under these contracts we believe that production requirements will be such that consumption of the products or services purchased under these commitments will occur in the normal production process we also purchase electricity consumed at our flat roll division pursuant to a contract which extends through december 2014 the contract designates 160 hours annually as interruptible service and establishes an agreed fixedrate energy charge per millkwh consumed for each year through the expiration of the agreement 

in our metals recycling operations we have certain fixed price contracts with various customers and suppliers for future delivery of nonferrous metals our risk strategy has been to enter into base metal financial contracts with the goal to protect the profit margin within certain parameters that was contemplated when we entered into the transaction with the customer or vendor at december 31 2012 we had a cumulative unrealized gain associated with these financial contracts of 22 million substantially all of which have a settlement date in 2013 we believe the customer contracts associated with the financial contracts will be fully consummated

 item 1 business 

our company 

we are one of the largest steel producers and one of the largest metals recyclers in the united states based on a current estimated annual steelmaking capability of 64 million tons and actual recycling volumes actual metals recycling shipments during 2011 2010 and 2009 respectively were 59 million gross tons 52 million gross tons and 36 million gross tons of ferrous materials and 11 billion pounds 961 million pounds and 780 million pounds of nonferrous metallics our steel shipments during 2011 2010 and 2009 were 58 million tons 53 million tons and 40 million tons respectively we reported net sales of 80 billion 63 billion and 40 billion during 2011 2010 and 2009 respectively at december 31 2011 we employed approximately 6530 individuals 89 of whom were nonunion 

steel dynamics inc was incorporated in indiana in august 1993 our principal executive offices are located at 7575 w jefferson boulevard fort wayne indiana 46804 and our telephone number is 2609693500 

the primary sources of our revenues are from the manufacture and sale of steel products processing and sale of recycled ferrous and nonferrous metals and to a lesser degree fabrication and sale of steel joist and decking products our operations are managed and reported based on three operating segments steel operations metals recycling and ferrous resources operations and steel fabrication operations 

steel operations steel operations consist of our five electricarc furnace minimills producing steel from steel scrap utilizing continuous casting automated rolling mills and various downstream finishing facilities our steel operations accounted for 61 61 and 63 of our consolidated net sales in 2011 2010 and 2009 respectively collectively our steel operations sell directly to end users and service centers these products are used in numerous industry sectors including the automotive agriculture energy construction commercial transportation and industrial machinery markets 

  sheet products our flat roll division sells a broad range of sheet steel products such as hot rolled cold rolled and coated steel products including a large variety of specialty products such as light gauge hot rolled galvanized galvalume® and painted products the techs operations comprised of three galvanizing lines also sells specialized galvanized sheet steels used in nonautomotive applications our sheet operations represented 60 63 and 65 of this segments net sales in 2011 2010 and 2009 respectively 

  long products our structural and rail division sells structural steel beams and pilings and a variety of standard strength and industrial quality grade rail for the railroad industry our engineered bar products division primarily sells special bar quality and merchant bar quality rounds and roundcornered squares our roanoke bar division sells billets and merchant steel products including angles plain rounds flats and channels steel of west virginia primarily sells merchant beams channels and specialty structural steel sections 

metals recycling and ferrous resources operations this operating segment includes our metals recycling operations liquid pig iron production facility and minnesota iron operations our metals recycling and ferrous resources operations accounted for 35 35 and 31 of our consolidated net sales in 2011 2010 and 2009 respectively 

  metals recycling our metals recycling operations represent our metals sourcing and processing operations and are the most significant source of income in this segment beginning in 2007 we have significantly grown our metals recycling business through the acquisitions of omnisource corporation in october 2007 and recycle south llc in june 2008 our metals recycling operations sell ferrous metals to steel mills and foundries and nonferrous metals such as copper brass aluminum and stainless steel to ingot manufacturers copper refineries and mills smelters and specialty mills our metals recycling operations represented 95 of this segments net sales in 2011 and 96 in both 2009 and 2010 our metals recycling operations also sell ferrous metals to our own steel mills as a raw material these shipments to our steel mills represented 43 42 and 39 of our metals recycling ferrous shipped tons in 2011 2010 and 2009 respectively 

  ferrous resources our ferrous resource operations consist of our two ironmaking initiatives iron dynamics idi a liquid pig iron production facility and our minnesota iron operations an iron nugget production facility and planned operations to supply the nugget facility with its primary raw material iron concentrate idi primarily produces liquid pig iron which is used as a scrap substitute raw material input exclusively at our flat roll division our minnesota iron operations 

consists of mesabi nugget owned 81 by us our planned future iron mining operations which is currently in the permitting process mesabi mining and our planned iron tailings operations mining resources owned 80 by us the construction of the mesabi nugget facility was completed in 2009 and initial production of iron nuggets commenced january 2010 throughout 2010 and 2011 we have refined this pioneering production process and changed equipment configurations to increase production and plant availability the facilitys anticipated annual production capacity is 500000 metric tons in 2011 and 2010 mesabi nugget produced 156000 and 75000 metric tons of ironnuggets respectively for use by our own steel mills we are currently constructing the iron tailings operation which is expected to start up in the third quarter of 2012 this operation which involves the extraction of iron ore tailings from previously developed stockpiles or waterfiled tailings basins is planned to provide iron ore tailings to be concentrated for use by mesabi nugget as a lowcost iron concentrate to the nugget production process 

steel fabrication operations our steel fabrication operations include six new millennium building systems plants which fabricate steel joists trusses girders and decking used within the nonresidential construction industry steel fabrication operations accounted for 3 3 and 4 of our consolidated net sales in 2011 2010 and 2009 respectively 

current environment 

the improving domestic and global economic conditions we began to experience in 2010 continued to improve during 2011 we experienced increased order volumes and pricing in all of our operations specifically we benefited from improvements in end user demand in the automotive truck and trailer energy heavy equipment agriculture transportation and other original equipment manufacturing industries resulting in increases in steel mill utilization we continue to face challenges in our structural steel and fabricated joist and decking products as the nonresidential construction industry continues to experience historically low levels of demand with only modest improvement in 2011 however we believe that we are well positioned in these operations to take advantage of these markets as they improve 

the increased domestic steel mill utilization rates also provided greater demand for our metals recycling operations allowing them to achieve record volumes in 2011 however margins were somewhat compressed as competition for feedstock materials remained strong in light of continued high export levels and limited supply from a weaker domestic manufacturing base 

our financial strategy includes a commitment to continue to improve our financial leverage metrics and provide for long termsustainable growth while maintaining appropriate liquidity levels our commitment to these goals drives a focus on controlling costs and maximizing per unit margins managing capital investments and prudent growth in september 2011 we entered into new fiveyear senior secured revolving credit facility which provides up to 11 billion of available borrowing with the original option to increase that level by an additional 4000 million however after issuing a 2750 million term loan in january 2012 the expansion amount is now 1250 million as a result of increased cash flow from operations during 2011 and our expanded revolver borrowing capability our liquidity increased 4635 million to almost 16 billion at the end of 2011 in january 2012 we executed a partial tender offer for our 7000 million 7 3  8  senior notes due november 2012 in order to mitigate a portion of the refinancing risk later in the year nearly 40 of the holders offered their notes in the tender representing approximately 2797 million we refinanced the tender through net proceeds received from the expansion of our senior secured credit facility in the form of a more cost effective term loan of 2750 million the term loan has minimal amortization requirements with a final maturity in the third quarter of 2016 

competitive strengths  business strategies 

we believe our financial strategy coupled with our competitive advantages of maintaining a low highly variable cost structure producing a diversified valueadded product offering controlling a secure supply of recycled ferrous metals fostering an entitywide entrepreneurial culture and having an experienced senior management team positions us well to continue to strengthen our leadership position during the economic recovery 

one of the lowest cost steel producers in the united states stateoftheart facilities  continue to maintain low production costs 

we are focused on continuing to maintain and enhance one of the lowest operating cost structures in the north american steel industry our low operating costs are primarily a result of our efficient plant designs and operations our high productivity rate such as our productivity rate of approximately 3 man hours per hot band ton produced at our flat roll divisions mill low ongoing maintenance cost requirements and strategic locations near our customers and sources of our primary raw material steel scrap 

we will continue to strive to optimize the use of our equipment enhance our productivity and explore new technologies to further improve our unit costs of production at each of our facilities we believe that as one of the lowest cost producers in each of our primary operating segments we are able to better manage through cyclical and noncyclical downturns and to consistently maximize our profitability we continuously seek to maximize the variability of our cost structure and to reduce per unit and fixed costs our incentive compensation plans at all employee levels are based on both divisional and consolidated company performance incentive compensation is designed to reward high productivity and efficient use of physical resources and capital employed 

secure supply of ferrous raw materials  develop metals recycling and ferrous resources business platform 

we maintain a secure supply of ferrous raw material resources through the benefit of our metals recycling operations as well as through our current ironmaking facilities ferrous materials represent our singlelargest component of our steel operations total manufacturing costs excluding the techs representing 68 and 62 of such costs in 2011 and 2010 respectively during 2011 and 2010 our metals recycling operations provided our steel operations with 52 and 47 respectively of its ferrous scrap requirements based on volume during 2011 and 2010 we consumed 60 million tons and 52 million tons respectively of metallic materials in our steel making furnaces of which iron units other than scrap represented approximately 7 and 8 respectively our ironmaking operations internally supplied 87 and 79 of these iron units in 2011 and 2010 respectively through the transfer of liquid pig iron hot briquetted iron and iron nuggets which are higherquality energysaving ferrous raw materials 

we expect global and domestic demand for steel products to continue to increase and we believe there may be supply constraints of various commodities including ferrous materials during periods of economic downturn significant reductions in available prime industrial scrap were a direct result of lower domestic manufacturing rates additionally as consumers utilize assets for longer periods of time and replace items less frequently the flow of other sources of scrap such as auto bodies appliances and other goods is also constrained the world demand for domestic ferrous resources has increased in nearly every year in the past decade impacting scrap availability as exports increase to developing countries 

we believe our metals recycling and ferrous resources operations not only provide us with a quality cost effective and secure raw material platform but we also believe it provides us with significant revenue generating and profitability opportunities that allow for funding of future growth whether in resources or in other ventures we intend to continue to participate in the development of 

new technologies to increase the effectiveness of our metals recycling recovery capabilities and to consider new strategic relationships in order to increase the amount of unprocessed metals we have the ability to source and eventually sell 

diversified product mix  expand product offerings 

our current products in our steel segment include hot rolled cold rolled galvanized galvalume® and painted sheet steel various structural steel beams and rails special bar quality steel and various merchant steel products including beams angles flats and channels in addition we offer steel finishing and fabrication services in the metals recycling operations of our metals recycling ferrous resources segment our products include an array of both ferrous and nonferrous scrap processing scrap management transportation and brokerage products and services finally our steel fabrication segment produces steel joists and steel decking materials this diversified mix of products enables us to access a broad range of enduser markets serve a broad customer base and helps mitigate our market exposure to any one product or enduser market in addition our valueadded product offerings help to balance our exposure to commodity grade products 

we will continue to seek additional opportunities to further expand our range of products whether through the expansion of existing facilities greenfield projects or acquisitions or ventures that may become available in both the domestic steel and recycling industries maximization of our minnesota iron operations as well as the expansions and upgrades of existing facilities are further important steps in pursuing our strategy of secure raw material sourcing and product line expansion 

strategic geographic locations  enter new geographic markets 

the locations of our steelmaking facilities near sources of scrap materials and near our customer base allow us to realize freight savings for inbound scrap as well as for outbound steel products destined for our customers recycled steel scrap and iron units represent the most significant component of our cost of steel manufacturing our metals recycling facilities are located in the upper midwest and southeastern united states and thus further expand our geographic service area we believe these regions account for a majority of the total steel scrap produced in the united states our coated sheet steel products are also more cost effectively available through our locations in pittsburgh pennsylvania and jeffersonville indiana due to river access in october 2010 we purchased certain joist assets from another manufacturer including three plants located in arkansas nevada and northern mexico which along with our locations in the southeast provides us with a national footprint allowing us to serve the entire joist and deck domestic market and national accounts 

we may seek to enter new markets in strategic geographic locations that offer attractive growth opportunities 

experienced management team and unique corporate culture  foster entrepreneurial culture 

our senior management team is highly experienced and has a proven track record in the steel and metals recycling industries managements objectives are closely aligned with our stockholders through meaningful stock ownership positions and performancebased compensation programs that are correlated to the companys profitability our corporate culture is also unique for all of our operating segments we emphasize decentralized decisionmaking and have established incentive compensation programs specifically designed to reward employee teams for their efforts toward enhancing productivity improving profitability and controlling costs 

we intend to continue to foster our entrepreneurial corporate culture and emphasize decentralized decision making and responsibility while rewarding teamwork innovation and operating efficiency we will also continue to focus on maintaining the effectiveness of our incentivebased bonus plans that are designed to enhance overall productivity and align the interests of our management and employees with our stockholders 

2012 outlook 

looking ahead to 2012 we are optimistic regarding a continued slow but steady growth in the us economy which could result in increased volumes compared to 2011 for all of our operations we believe steel consumption will continue to grow in the automotive transportation energy industrial agricultural and heavy equipment sectors we believe residential and nonresidential construction activity has likely reached its bottom and may continue to show some modest growth the fruition of these combined factors should result in an improved operating environment for all our segments in the coming year 

our focus will continue to be on disciplined cost control gross margin optimization and prudent growth opportunities while continuing to manage risk in an uncertain economic environment our current estimated 2012 cash allocation plan includes the investment of between 2250 and 2500 million in capital expenditures in our existing and announced operations 

industry segments 

we have three reporting segments steel operations metals recycling and ferrous resources operations and steel fabrication operations please refer to item 8  consolidated financial statements and supplementary data for additional information 



our steel operations segment consists of steelmaking and coating operations the following chart summarizes the locations and the current capacities of our facilities 





1 excess billet tonnage available for sale 

note capacities represent manufacturing capabilities based on mill configuration and related employee support these capacities do not represent expected volumes in a given year in addition estimates of mill capacity particularly rolling capacity are highly dependent on the specific product mix manufactured each of our mills can and do roll many different types and sizes of products therefore our capacity estimates assume a typical product mix 

sheet products 

our sheet steel products are produced by both our flat roll division which consists of our flat roll mill galvanizing and painting facilities in butler indiana our galvanizing and painting facilities in jeffersonville indiana and the techs our pittsburgh pennsylvaniabased galvanizing company which operates three galvanizing facilities galvtech metaltech and nextech 

our flat roll mill manufactures flat rolled hot rolled cold rolled and coated steel products we produced 29 million tons and 27 million tons at this facility in 2011 and 2010 respectively our products are characterized by high quality surface characteristics precise tolerances and light gauge in addition this mill has achieved iso 90012008—ansiisoasq q90012008 certification we believe that these certifications have enabled us to serve a broad range of customers who may require certifications for themselves or to satisfy the endusers of our steel products 

our flat roll mill has two twinshell electric arc furnaces which enable us to melt scrap in one vessel while tapping the other vessel and refilling it with steel scrap and iron units to make it ready for the next heat this results in more heats and greater productivity we have three ladle metallurgy stations two continuous thinslab casters which produce twoinch slabs and two tunnel furnaces our hot rolling mill which progressively reduces the slab in thickness consists of a sevenstand rolling mill capable of rolling sheet steel down to 10 mm with excellent surface quality which enables us to access markets previously available only to more expensive cold finished material 

located within our flat roll mill we have a hot rolled galvanizing line capable of coating steel in gauges from 044 to 160 inches and in widths ranging from 40 to 61 inches also within our flat roll mill we have a cold rolled galvanizing line capable of coating steel in gauges from 012 to 070 inches and in widths ranging from 40 to 61 inches our onsite paint line receives material directly from our other processing lines and is capable of painting hot rolled galvanized coil cold rolled coil and cold rolled galvanized coil in gauges of 012 to 070 inches and in widths ranging from 40 to 61 inches we believe this enables us to realize substantial savings in the production of painted coil and pass along savings and efficiencies to our customers when compared to remote offsite coating facilities 

in jeffersonville indiana we have a cold rolled galvanizing facility located within the clark maritime centre on the ohio river this facility is capable of coating cold rolled steel in gauges from 012 to 040 inches and in widths between 40 and 61 inches this gauge range is lighter than that available from our butler facility and creates further expansion of our value added product offerings our flat roll mill provides our jeffersonville facility with cold rolled material

we sell a portion of our hot rolled coils produced at our flat roll mill directly to endusers or more often to intermediate steel processors and service centers where they may be pickled cold rolled annealed tempered galvanized or painted by those customers the rest of the hot rolled coils are directed to our cold mill where we add value to this product through our own pickling cold rolling annealing tempering galvanizing and painting processes a portion of our cold rolled production is shipped to our jeffersonville indiana galvanizing facility 

cold rolled products cold rolled steel is hot rolled steel that has been further processed through a pickler and then passed through a rolling mill until the desired gauge or thickness and other physical properties have been achieved cold rolling reduces gauge and hardens the steel and when further processed through an annealing furnace and a temper mill improves uniformity ductility and formability cold rolling can also impart various surface finishes and textures cold rolled steel is used in exposed steel applications that demand higher surface quality or finish such as exposed automobile and appliance panels cold rolled material is often coated or painted as a result of higher processing costs cold rolled prices are typically higher than hot rolled prices 

coated products hot rolled or cold rolled steel can be coated with zinc to render it corrosionresistant and to improve its paintability galvanized galvannealed galvalume® electrogalvanized and 

aluminized products are types of coated steels these are also the highest valueadded sheet products because they require the greatest degree of processing and tend to have the strictest quality requirements coated steel is used in high volume applications such as automobiles household appliances roofing and siding heating and air conditioning equipment air ducts switch boxes chimney flues awnings garbage cans and food containers our paint lines in butler and jeffersonville incorporate stateoftheart coil coating equipment with quick color change capability and online color matching which allows us to produce prepainted steel products that are used in many of these same end products 

we also produce hot rolled pickled and oiled hot rolled galvanized hot rolled galvannealed cold rolled galvanized cold rolled galvannealed and fully processed cold rolled sheet as a result of our lighter gauge hot rolling capabilities our hot rolled galvanized and galvannealed steel products are capable of replacing products that have traditionally only been available as more expensive cold rolled galvanized or cold rolled galvannealed steel this material is typically used in transportation products building products such as raised garage door panels heating and cooling products appliances furniture and lighting equipment 

customers steel processors and service centers typically act as intermediaries between primary steel producers and the many enduser manufacturers that require further processing of hot rolled coils the additional processing performed by the intermediate steel processors and service centers include pickling galvanizing cutting to length slitting to size leveling blanking shape correcting edge rolling shearing and stamping we believe that our intermediate steel processor and service center customers will remain an integral part of our customer base the location of our jeffersonville facility on the ohio river also creates opportunities for market expansion into other geographic regions the techs produces galvanized flat rolled products that are similar to those produced by our flat roll division and sold to a similar customer base each of the techs facilities specializes in the galvanizing of specific types of flat rolled steels in generally nonautomotive applications servicing a variety of customers in the heating ventilation and air conditioning hvac construction agriculture and consumer goods markets we exported 2 of our sheet products during both 2011 and 2010

metals recycling 

our metals recycling operations include both ferrous and nonferrous scrap metal processing transportation marketing brokerage and consulting services in over 70 locations primarily in the midwest and southeast portion of the united states in addition omnisource designs installs and manages customized scrap management programs for industrial manufacturing companies at more than 300 locations throughout north america our steel mills utilize a portion of the steel scrap processed through omnisource as raw material in our steelmaking operations and the remainder is sold to other consumers such as other steel manufacturers and foundries in 2011 2010 and 2009 omnisource supplied our steel mills with approximately 52 47 and 47 respectively of the tons of their ferrous raw material requirements representing approximately 43 42 and 39 respectively of omnisources 2011 2010 and 2009 ferrous shipped tons 

our metals recycling operations processed andor brokered approximately 59 million gross tons and 52 million gross tons of ferrous material during 2011 and 2010 respectively omnisource also processed and brokered approximately 11 billion and 961 million pounds pounds of nonferrous material during 2011 and 2010 respectively omnisources revenues by major scrap category in 2010 were 64 ferrous and 36 nonferrous including stainless in 2011 as compared to approximately 62 ferrous and 38 nonferrous in 2010 during both 2011 and 2010 approximately 11 of omnisources revenues were from export sales primarily from nonferrous materials 

we sell various grades of ferrous scrap metals to steel mills and foundries and we sell various grades of nonferrous metals such as copper brass aluminum and stainless steel we generally sell these nonferrous materials to aluminum sheet and ingot manufacturers brass and bronze ingot makers copper refineries and mills smelters specialty mills alloy manufacturers and other consumers ferrous scrap metal is the primary raw material for electric arc furnaces such as those operated by our steel 

mills we purchase ferrous and nonferrous scrap metals processed and unprocessed in a variety of forms for our metals recycling facilities 

ferrous scrap comes from two primary sources i manufacturers and industrial plants metal fabrication plants machine shops and factories which generate steel scrap referred to as prompt or industrial scrap and ii scrap dealers retail individuals auto wreckers demolition firms and others who generate steel and iron scrap referred to as obsolete scrap market demand and the composition quality size weight and location of the materials are the primary factors that determine prices we purchase nonferrous scrap from three primary sources i manufacturers and other nonferrous scrap sources which generate or sell scrap aluminum copper stainless steel and other nonferrous metals ii producers of electricity telecommunication service providers aerospace defense and recycling companies that generate nonferrous scrap consisting primarily of copper wire aluminum beverage cans and various other metals and alloys and iii retail individuals who deliver directly to our facilities material which they collect from a variety of sources during 2011 the company expanded its number of retail yards in strategic locations to increase costeffective scrap sourcing additional retail yard expansion is planned for 2012 we also collect ferrous and nonferrous scrap from sources other than those that are delivered directly to our processing facilities by placing retrieval containers near these sources the containers are subsequently transported to our processing facilities 

our metals recycling facilities consist of offices warehouse buildings and openair collection and processing facilities of various sizes and acreages equipped with specialized equipment for processing both ferrous and nonferrous metal where we receive sort process and store the metals we equip our facilities with scales shears baling presses briquetting machines conveyors and magnetic separators which enable us to efficiently process large volumes of scrap metals to facilitate processing shipping and receiving we equip our ferrous metal processing centers with presses shredders or hydraulic shears to prepare and compress scrap metal for easier handling cranes are utilized to handle scrap metals for processing and to load material for shipment many of our facilities have rail access as ferrous scrap is primarily shipped by open gondola railcar additionally several of the metals recycling divisions have achieved certifications including iso 90012008 and iso 140012004 certification we continue to make improvements such as our successful installation and commissioning at three locations of the gamma tech analyzer which allows for a more precise measure of copper content in scrap metal these additions have benefited our steel mills by providing a known lowcopper scrap source while providing omnisource a competitive product advantage to other customers during 2012 we also plan to add enhanced downstream separation technology at two of our locations to further enhance the recovery of nonferrous materials from residual shredded material and decrease landfill costs 

products our metals recycling operations primarily involve the purchase processing and resale of ferrous and nonferrous scrap metals into reusable forms and grades 

we process an array of ferrous products used in foundry and steel mill applications for use in our own steel mills or for resale to other customers through a variety of methods including sorting shearing cutting torching baling shredding briquetting and breaking our major ferrous products include heavy melting steel busheling bundled scrap shredded scrap and other scrap metal products such as steel turnings and cast iron these products vary in properties or attributes related to cleanness size of individual pieces and residual alloys these factors are determined by the specific needs and requirements of the consumer and affect the individual products relative value we process nonferrous products including aluminum brass copper stainless steel and other nonferrous metals for use in foundry mill refining and smelting applications our superior aluminum alloys operations produce specification aluminum alloys in the form of ingots sows and molten metal in addition we provide transportation logistics truck rail and river barge management services marketing brokerage and consulting services related to the scrap industry 

customers we sell processed ferrous scrap to endusers such as steel producing minimills integrated steelmakers foundries secondary smelters and metal brokers who aggregate materials for other large users most of our ferrousscrap customers purchase processed scrap through negotiated spot sales contracts which establish a quantity purchase for the month the price we charge for ferrous scrap depends upon market demand and transportation costs as well as the quality and grade of the scrap in many cases our selling price also includes the cost of transportation to the enduser 

we sell processed nonferrous scrap to endusers such as specialty steelmakers foundries aluminum sheet and ingot manufacturers copper refineries and smelters brass and bronze ingot manufacturers wire and cable producers utilities and telephone networks 

markets according to the institute of scrap recycling industries isri approximately 74 million metric tons and 70 million metric tons of recycled iron and steel including stainless and alloys were processed in the united states during 2010 and 2009 respectively in addition approximately 8 million metric tons of nonferrous scrap including aluminum copper lead and zinc were processed during both 2010 and 2009 scrap is a global commodity influenced by conditions in a number of industrialized and emergingmarkets throughout asia europe and north america isri estimates that approximately 20 million metric tons and 21 million metric tons of ferrous scrap were exported from the united states in 2010 and 2009 respectively nonferrous exports from the united states were estimated by isri to be 30 million metric tons and 27 million metric tons in 2010 and 2009 respectively 

scrap metal supplies are generated from a variety of sources industrial scrap or home scrap is generated from steel processing and manufacturing facilities utilizing steel in their production process obsolete scrap including post consumer waste demolition of steel structures and automobiles represent a significant source of scrap generation we do not purchase a material amount of scrap metal from a single source or from a limited number of major sources 

competitors the markets for scrap metals are highly competitive both in the purchase of raw scrap and the sale of processed scrap with regard to the purchase of raw scrap we compete with numerous independent recyclers as well as smaller scrap companies engaged only in collecting industrial scrap in many cases we also purchase unprocessed scrap metal from smaller scrap dealers and other processors successful procurement of materials is determined primarily by the price offered by the purchaser for the raw scrap and the proximity of our processing facility to the source of the raw scrap both ferrous and nonferrous scrap sells as a commodity in both national and international markets which are affected by relative economic conditions currency fluctuations and the availability and cost of transportation competition for sales of processed scrap is based primarily on the price quality and location of the scrap metals as well as the level of service provided in terms of reliability and timing of delivery 

we also face potential competition for sales of processed scrap from other producers of steel products such as integrated steel mills and steel minimills some of which are vertically integrated in the scrap metals recycling business as a number of steel manufacturers currently operate their own scrap yards in addition other steel mills may compete with us in attempting to secure scrap supply through direct purchasing from our scrap suppliers scrap metal processors also face competition from substitutes for prepared ferrous scrap such as prereduced iron pellets hot briquetted iron pig iron iron carbide and other forms of processed iron the availability and relative prices of substitutes for ferrous scrap could result in a decreased demand for processed ferrous scrap and could result in lower prices andor lower demand for our scrap products 

the industry is highly fragmented with many smaller familyowned companies although omnisource also competes with a number of national and global companies each of which has multiple locations in areas in which omnisource also operates these larger entities include the david j joseph company a subsidiary of nucor corporation sims metal management ferrous 

processing and trading co aleris international cmc a division of commercial metals company and schnitzer steel in addition omnisource competes with many regional scrap companies no single scrap metals recycler has a significant market share in the domestic market 

ferrous resources 

iron dynamics 

iron dynamics developed a process of producing liquid pig iron and hot briquetted iron hbi that serves as a substitute for a portion of the metallic raw material mix that goes into our electric arc furnaces to produce steel direct reduced iron dri is a metallic product made from millscale and iron ore fines that has been reduced in a rotary hearth furnace using natural gas and coal the reduction method employed by iron dynamics uses coal as the reducing agent the dri is either compacted by briquetters to form hbi or is processed further to produce liquid pig iron hbi can be immediately used in our melting furnaces or stockpiled for later use liquid pig iron is tapped from iron dynamics submerged arc furnace and immediately transferred in ladles to the flat roll mills melt shop where it is combined with scrap steel in the mills electric arc furnaces 

the plants primary focus is to maximize liquid pig iron production due to the inherent economic benefits achieved when the material is used in the steelmaking process such as reduced energy cost reduced materials cost and quicker melting cycles during 2011 and 2010 respectively iron dynamics produced 230000 and 226000 metric tons of which 198000 metric tons or 86 and 180000 metric tons or 80 was liquid pig iron we have used and plan to use all of the facilitys output in our flat roll steelmaking operations 

minnesota iron operations—mesabi nugget mesabi mining and mining resources 

our minnesota iron operations consists of mesabi nugget our ironmaking project at hoyt lakes minnesota 81 owned by us our nearby planned iron mining operation which is currently in the permitting process mesabi mining and our planned iron tailings operations mining resources 80 owned by us mesabi nugget is the worlds first commercial ironmaking facility to use the itmk3® process an ironnugget production technology pioneered by kobe steel ltd which kobe steel is licensing to the venture the construction of the mesabi nugget facility was completed in 2009 and initial production of iron nuggets commenced january 2010 throughout 2010 and 2011 we have refined this pioneering production process and changed equipment configurations to increase production and plant availability the facilitys anticipated annual production capacity is 500000 metric tons in 2011 and 2010 mesabi nugget produced 156000 and 75000 metric tons of ironnuggets respectively for use by our own steel mills we are currently constructing the iron tailings operation which is expected to start up in the third quarter 2012 this operation which involves the extraction of iron ore tailings from previously developed stockpiles or waterfiled tailings basins is planned to provide iron ore tailings to be concentrated for use by mesabi nugget as a lowcost iron concentrate to the nugget production process 

sources availability and cost of steel and other operations raw materials 

scrap metals our principal raw material of our steel operations segment is scrap metal derived from among other sources home scrap generated internally at steel mills themselves industrial scrap generated as a byproduct of manufacturing and obsolete scrap recycled from endoflife automobiles appliances railroad cars and railroad track materials agricultural machinery and demolition scrap from obsolete structures containers and machines 

scrap typically comprises more than 80 of the metallic melt mix in electric arc furnace steelmaking in contrast to integrated mill steelmaking where the proportion of scrap has traditionally been approximately 25 to 35 depending upon the scrap substitute material that may be available 

from time to time and the relative cost of such material the percentage of scrap used in our steelmaking operations could be reduced in our metallic melt mix 

many variables can impact scrap prices all of which reflect the pushes and pulls of the supply demand equation these factors include the level of us new steel production for highquality lowresidual scrap is a byproduct of new steel manufacturing activity the level of exports of scrap from the united states the amount of obsolete scrap production and the effect of speculation on the amount of scrap offered on the market from time to time generally as domestic steel demand increases so does scrap demand and resulting scrap prices the reverse is also normally but not always true with scrap prices following steel prices downward when supply exceeds demand 

the following table provides pricing per gross ton from american metal market and iron age pig iron estimates for ferrous materials used in steel production 

the price of steel scrap as a commodity has tended to be volatile rising and falling with supply and demand and not always in lock step with or in proportion to the market price of new steel when scrap costs greatly accelerate this threatens one of the principal elements of a minimills traditional lower cost structure—the cost of its metallic raw material therefore having a lower cost alternative source of iron for a portion of a minimills melt mix if realizable would partially buffer the effects of high scrap prices and scrap price volatility with the growing proportion of electric furnace steelmaking both worldwide and domestically we believe that the benefit of developing a costeffective alternate iron source to augment scrap our primary raw material makes good economic sense in the long run 

iron units in addition to scrap direct reduced iron hot briquetted iron pig iron and ironnuggets are used in electric furnace minimill steel production during 2011 and 2010 we consumed 60 million tons and 52 million tons respectively of metallic materials in our steel making furnaces of which iron units other than scrap represented approximately 7 and 8 of the tons 

respectively of these iron substitute units consumed our iron dynamics and mesabi nugget operations together supplied 87 and 79 of these iron units in 2011 and 2010 respectively 

iron concentrate and coal at our mesabi nugget operations iron concentrate and coal represent a significant portion of the total necessary input to and thus cost of iron nugget production we currently are able to obtain all our iron needs from reliable external sources iron concentrate is generally priced quarterly with the price driven largely by a small number of suppliers and the global market for iron iron concentrate costs are therefore currently outside our control and may change independent of both scrap costs and ultimately the costs we can charge for our steel products development of our own more stable lowcost iron sources like mining resources and mesabi mining will therefore be a very meaningful step in securing a more stable supply of lower cost iron units coal pricing is typically set annually and although supply is generally sufficient as there are ample reliable sources domestically unexpected mine outages can interrupt availability and potentially increase our costs given the annual pricing and the potential supply interruptions the cost of coal may not correlate with the ever changing environment of scrap and steel pricing

markets our fabrication operations primarily serve the nonresidential construction industry the recent downturn and slow recovery in the nonresidential construction markets has resulted in demand for joist and deck products to decrease from previous levels seen in 2008 and prior the steel joist and deck market in the united states was approximately 10 million tons in 2010 and 2009 and has rebounded slightly to 12 million tons in 2011 based on trade association estimates however we believe the longterm prospects for this business are sound because of the current market conditions we believe the ramp up of the recently acquired locations will continue to proceed slowly as the market strengthens 

competitors our main competitors in the joist business are vulcraft a division of nucor corporation canam group quincy joist co joist structural and valley joist in the steel decking business new millenniums main competitors are vulcraft wheeling corrugating co quincy joist co consolidated systems inc and canam group 

energy resources 

electricity electricity is a significant input required in the electric arc furnaces in our steelmaking operations excluding the techs representing 5 of steel production costs of goods sold in 2011 and 2010 we have entered into a fixed price interruptible electricity supply agreement that extends through december 31 2012 for our flat roll division in butler indiana the contract allows our supplier to interrupt service in the event of an emergency or in response to various market conditions during 2012 we will be working with the electric company to create a similar agreement for beyond 2012 and do not believe this will materially change our operations in future years our structural and rail division and roanoke bar division purchase electricity at current market prices steel of west virginia had negotiated fixed prices through 2011 and the techs have negotiated fixed prices through 2012 our engineered bar products division has a combination of fixed pricing and market pricing for the various components of the electrical services demand charge energy charge riders etc 

gas we purchase a portion of our steel operations natural gas requirements at market prices and a portion by entering into hedging transactions on the futures markets for ultimate physical delivery in order to help minimize price volatility these contracts typically have duration of up to 24 months natural gas represented 2 of steel operations other than the techs costs of goods sold in 2011 and 2010

environmental matters 

our steel operations metals recycling and ferrous resources operations and steel fabrication operations are subject to substantial and evolving local state and federal environmental health and safety laws and regulations concerning among other things emissions to the air discharges to surface and ground water and to sewer systems and the generation handling storage transportation treatment and disposal of toxic and hazardous substances our manufacturing operations are dependent upon both state and federal permits regulating discharges into the air or into the water in order to operate our facilities we believe that in all current respects our steel operations metals recycling and 

ferrous resources operations and steel fabrication operations are in material compliance with all provisions of federal and state laws concerning the environment and we do not currently believe that future compliance with such provisions will have a material adverse effect on our results of operations cash flows or financial condition 

since the level of enforcement of environmental laws and regulations or the nature of those laws that may be enacted from time to time are sometimes subject to changing social or political pressures our environmental capital expenditures and costs for environmental compliance may increase in the future in addition due to the possibility of unanticipated regulatory or other developments the amount and timing of future environmental expenditures may vary substantially from those currently anticipated the cost of current and future environmental compliance may also place us steel producers at a competitive disadvantage with respect to foreign steel producers which may not be required to undertake equivalent costs in their operations 

pursuant to the resource conservation and recovery act or rcra which governs the treatment handling and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes the united states environmental protection agency or us epa and authorized state environmental agencies conduct inspections of rcra regulated facilities to identify areas where there may have been releases of solid or hazardous constituents into the environment and require the facilities to take corrective action to remediate any such releases rcra also allows citizens to bring certain suits against regulated facilities for potential damages and clean up our steelmaking facilities are subject to rcra our manufacturing operations produce various byproducts some of which for example electric arc furnace or eaf dust are categorized as industrial or hazardous waste requiring special handling for disposal or for the recovery of metallics we collect such coproducts in approved baghouses and other facilities but we are also examining alternative reclamation technologies to recycle some of these products while we cannot predict the future actions of the regulators or other interested parties the potential exists for required corrective action at these facilities the costs of which could be substantial 

under the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act or cercla the us epa and in some instances private parties have the authority to impose joint and several liability for the remediation of contaminated properties upon generators of waste current and former site owners and operators transporters and other potentially responsible parties regardless of fault or the legality of the original disposal activity many states including indiana have statutes and regulatory authorities similar to cercla and to the us epa we have a number of waste handling agreements with various contractors to properly dispose of our electric arc furnace dust and certain other waste products of steelmaking however we cannot assure you that even if there has been no fault by us we may not still be cited as a waste generator by reason of an environmental clean up at a site to which our waste products were transported 

in addition to rcra and cercla there are a number of other environmental health and safety laws and regulations that apply to our facilities and may affect our operations by way of example and not of limitation certain portions of the federal clean air act clean water act toxic substances control act oil pollution act safe drinking water act and emergency planning and community righttoknow act as well as state and local laws and regulations implemented by the regulatory agencies apply to our facilities operations many of these laws allow both the governments and citizens to bring certain suits against regulated facilities for alleged environmental violations finally any steelmaking and metals recycling company could be subject to certain toxic tort suits brought by citizens or other third parties alleging causes of action such as nuisance negligence trespass infliction of emotional distress or other claims alleging personal injury or property damage 

employees 

our work force consisted of approximately 6530 full time employees at december 31 2011 of which approximately 11 were represented by collective bargaining agreements the largest group of unionized employees is at steel of west virginia the remaining unionized employees are located in five different omnisource metals recycling locations each of which has its own agreement we believe that our relationship with our employees is good

 item 1a risk factors 

  many factors could have an effect on our financial condition cash flows and results of operations we are subject to various risks resulting from changing economic environmental political industry business and financial conditions the factors described below represent our principal risks  

risks related to our industry 

our industry is affected by domestic and global economic factors including the risk of a recurrent recession 

our financial results are substantially dependent not only upon overall economic conditions in the united states in europe and in asia but also as they may affect one or more of the industries upon which we depend for the sale of our products a recurrent recession in the united states or globally could substantially decrease the demand for our products and adversely affect our business moreover many of our products are commodities subject to their own cyclical fluctuations in supply and demand in both metal consuming and metal generating industries including the construction industry metals industries have historically been vulnerable to significant declines in consumption and product pricing during prolonged periods of economic downturn such as during late 2008 and 2009 before beginning to rebound in 2010 and 2011 likewise the pace of domestic nonresidential construction activity has historically slowed significantly during economic downturns and has been at historically low levels in recent years 

our business is also dependent upon certain industries such as commercial and government construction energy metals service centers automotive agriculture transportation petrochemical and original equipment manufacturing and these are also cyclical in nature therefore these industries may 

experience their own significant fluctuations in demand for our products based on such things as economic conditions energy prices consumer demand and infrastructure funding decisions by governments many of these factors are beyond our control as a result of the volatility in the industries we serve we may have difficulty increasing or maintaining our level of sales or profitability if the industries we serve were to suffer a downturn then our business may be further adversely affected 

our level of production and our sales and earnings are subject to significant fluctuations as a result of the cyclical nature of the steel industry and some of the industries we serve 

the steel manufacturing business is cyclical in nature and the price of the steel we make may fluctuate significantly due to many factors beyond our control the timing and magnitude of these price fluctuations are difficult to predict the sale of our manufactured steel products is directly affected by demand for our products in other cyclical industries such as the automotive oil and gas gas transmission residential and commercialindustrial construction commercial equipment rail transportation appliance agricultural and durable goods industries while the domestic automotive industry which is a major consumer of new steel and a major generator of steel scrap has shown recent signs of improvement it has not yet fully recovered from the unprecedented downturn in demand of a couple of years ago economic difficulties stagnant economies supplydemand imbalances and currency fluctuations in the united states or globally could further decrease the demand for our products or increase the amount of imports of steel into the united states which could decrease our sales margins and profitability 

the scrap metal recycling industry has historically been and is expected to remain highly cyclical a prolonged period of low scrap prices or a fall in scrap metal prices could result in the weakening of inbound scrap flows and thereby reduced our ability to obtain process and sell recycled materials and this could have a material adverse effect on our metals recycling operations results 

scrap metal prices are volatile and operating results within the metals recycling industry in general have historically been cyclical and are expected to remain highly cyclical in nature similarly but not necessarily paralleling the price fluctuations in the steel business the purchase prices for automobile bodies and various other grades of obsolete and industrial scrap as well as the selling prices for processed and recycled scrap metals we utilize in our own manufacturing process or we resell to others through our metals recycling operations are also highly volatile as a metals recycler we may attempt to respond to changing recycled metal selling prices by adjusting the scrap metal purchase prices we pay to others but our ability to do this may be limited by competitive or other factors during periods of low scrap prices when inbound scrap flow may slow considerably as scrap generators hold onto their scrap in the hope of getting higher prices later conversely increased foreign demand for scrap due to economic expansion in countries such as china india brazil and turkey can result in an outflow of available domestic scrap as well as higher scrap prices that cannot always be passed on to domestic scrap consumers further reducing the available domestic scrap flows and scrap margins all of which could adversely affect our sales and profitability 

imports of steel into the united states have in the past adversely affected and may again adversely affect us steel prices which could impact our sales margins and profitability 

excessive imports of steel into the united states as a result of excess world supply have in past years exerted and may again in the future exert downward pressure on us steel prices and may reduce or may negatively affect our ability to increase our sales margins and profitability us steel producers compete with many foreign producers including those in china competition from foreign producers is typically strong and is periodically exacerbated by weakening of the economies of certain foreign steelmaking countries greater steel exports to the united states tend to occur at depressed 

prices when steel producing countries experience periods of economic difficulty decreased demand for steel products or excess capacity 

in addition we believe the downward pressure on and periodically depressed levels of us steel prices in some recent years have been further exacerbated by imports of steel involving dumping and subsidy abuses by foreign steel producers some foreign steel producers are owned controlled or subsidized by foreign governments as a result decisions by these producers with respect to their production sales and pricing are sometimes influenced to a greater degree by political and economic policy considerations than by prevailing market conditions realities of the marketplace or consideration of profit or loss however while some tariffs and quotas are periodically put in to effect for certain steel products imported from a number of countries that have been found to have been unfairly pricing steel imports to the us many of these are only shortlived when such tariffs or duties expire or if others are further relaxed or repealed or if relatively higher us steel prices make it attractive for foreign steelmakers to export their steel products to the united states despite the presence of duties or tariffs the resurgence of substantial imports of foreign steel could create downward pressure on us steel prices 

chinas current steelmaking overcapacity in relation to its steel consumption could have a material adverse effect on domestic and global steel pricing and could result in increased steel imports into the united states 

a significant factor in the worldwide volatility of steel pricing in recent years was the explosive growth in chinese steel consumption in relation to its domestic production which until the third quarter of 2008 had vastly outpaced that countrys capacity to produce steel in sufficient quantity to serve its internal demand the shortage of chinese domestic steel supply during this time period resulted not only in heightened chinese demand for imported steel and other raw materials with a consequent upward spiral in worldwide steel pricing for finished steel products but also led to a rapid and significant expansion of steel production capacity in china as well as many of the commodities supplies and services utilized in steelmaking however the subsequent drop in chinese steel consumption that began in 2008 and has not fully recovered in addition to the continued utilization of a large amount of outdated inefficient and government subsidized production capacity has resulted in a situation in which chinas steel producing capacity currently exceeds that countrys reducing demand for many kinds of steel products that we produce has made china an increasingly larger net exporter of millions of tons of steel since 2008 therefore a combination of a slowdown in chinas economic growth rate and steel consumption coupled with its own expansion of steelmaking capacity could result in a further weakening of both domestic and global steel demand and steel pricing also should chinese steelmaking capacity remain the same or further increase or should its demand either not increase or further weaken china might not only remain a net exporter of steel but many asian and european steel producers whose steel output previously fed chinas steel import needs could find their way into the us market through increased steel imports causing a further erosion of margins or negatively impacting our ability to increase our prices 

the worldwide economic downturn that began in 2008 and the difficult conditions in the global industrial capital and credit markets that resulted have adversely affected and may continue to adversely affect our business and our industry as well as the industries of many of our customers and suppliers upon whom we are dependent 

many of the markets in which our customers participate such as the automotive consumer products original equipment agriculture transportation manufacturing commercial residential and government construction and metals service center industries are also cyclical in nature and experience significant fluctuations in demand for our steel products based on economic conditions consumer demand raw material and energy costs and decisions by our government to fund or not fund infrastructure projects such as highways bridges schools energy plants railroads and transportation 

facilities many of these factors are beyond our control these markets are highly competitive to a large extent driven by enduse markets and may experience overcapacity all of which may affect demand for and pricing of our products 

a continued or further decline in consumer and business confidence and spending together with severe reductions in the availability and cost of credit as well as volatility in the capital and credit markets could adversely affect the business and economic environment in which we operate and the profitability of our business we are also exposed to risks associated with the creditworthiness of our suppliers and customers if the availability of credit to fund or support the continuation and expansion of our customers business operation is curtailed or if the cost of that credit is increased the resulting inability of our customers or of their customers to access either credit or absorb the increased cost of that credit could adversely affect our business by reducing our sales or by increasing our exposure to losses from uncollectible customer accounts these conditions and a renewed disruption of the credit markets could also result in financial instability of some of our suppliers and customers the consequences of such adverse effects could include the interruption of production at the facilities of our customers the reduction delay or cancellation of customer orders delays or interruptions of the supply of raw materials we purchase and bankruptcy of customers suppliers or other creditors any of these events may adversely affect our profitability cash flow and financial condition 

volatility and major fluctuations in scrap metal and pig iron prices and our potential inability to pass such higher costs on to our customers may constrain operating levels and reduce profit margins 

steel producers require large amounts of raw materials including scrap metal and scrap substitute products such as pig iron pelletized iron and other supplies such as graphite electrodes and ferroalloys while our vertical integration into the metals recycling business through our omnisource subsidiary and into the ironmaking business through our iron dynamics facility and startup of our minnesota iron operations should enable us to be a cost effective supplier to our steelmaking operations for some of our metallics requirements we will still need to rely on other metallics and raw material suppliers as well as upon general industry supply conditions for the balance of our needs 

purchase prices for auto bodies scrap metal and scrap substitute products such as pig iron that we consume and selling prices for scrap and recycled metals that we sell to third parties are volatile and beyond our control while omnisource attempts to respond to changing recycled metal selling prices through adjustments to its metal purchase prices its ability to do so is limited by competitive and other market factors changing prices could potentially impact the volume of scrap metal available to us and the volume and realized margins of processed metals we sell 

the availability and prices of raw materials may also be negatively affected by new laws and regulations allocation by suppliers interruptions in production accidents or natural disasters changes in exchange rates worldwide price fluctuations and the availability and cost of transportation 

if prices for ferrous metallics increase by a greater margin than corresponding price increases for the sale of our steel products we may not be able to recoup such cost increases from increases in the selling prices of steel products our inability to pass on all or any substantial part of such cost increases through scrap or other surcharges or to provide for our customers needs because of the potential unavailability of key raw materials or other inputs may result in production curtailments or may otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations or prospects 

the cost and availability of electricity and natural gas are also subject to volatile market conditions 

steel producers like us consume large amounts of energy inasmuch as minimills melt steel scrap in electric arc furnaces and use natural gas to heat steel billets for rolling into finished products we rely on third parties for the supply of energy resources we consume in our steelmaking activities the 

prices for and availability of electricity natural gas oil and other energy resources are all also subject to volatile market conditions often affected by weather conditions as well as political and economic factors beyond our control as large consumers of electricity and gas we must have dependable delivery in order to operate accordingly we are at risk in the event of an energy disruption prolonged blackouts or brownouts or disruptions caused by natural disasters or by political considerations would substantially disrupt our production moreover much of our finished steel products is typically delivered by truck unforeseen fluctuations in the price of fuel attributable to fluctuations in crude oil prices would also have a negative impact on our costs or on the costs of many of our customers in addition changes in certain environmental regulations in the us including those that may impose output limitations or higher costs associated with climate change or greenhouse gas emissions legislation could substantially increase the cost of manufacturing and raw materials such as energy to us and other us steel producers 

fluctuations in the value of the united states dollar relative to other currencies may adversely affect our business  

fluctuations in the value of the dollar can be expected to affect our business a strong us dollar makes imported metal products less expensive potentially resulting in more imports of steel products into the us by our foreign competitors while a weak us dollar may have the opposite impact on imports 

compliance with and changes in environmental and remediation requirements could result in substantially increased capital requirements and operating costs 

existing laws or regulations as currently interpreted or as may be interpreted in the future as well as future laws or regulations may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

we are subject to comprehensive local state federal and international statutory and regulatory environmental requirements relating to among other things 

• the acceptance storage treatment handling and disposal of solid and hazardous waste • the discharge of materials into air • the management and treatment of wastewater and storm water • the remediation of soil and groundwater contamination • global climate change legislation or regulation • the need for and the ability to timely obtain air water or other operating permits • the remediation and reclamation of land used for iron mining • natural resource damages and • the protection of our employees health and safety 27 

compliance with environmental laws and regulations which affect both our steelmaking and our metals recycling and ironmaking operations is a significant factor in our business we are required to obtain and comply with environmental permits and licenses and failure to obtain or renew or the violation of any permit or license if not remedied could result in substantial fines and penalties suspension of operations or the closure of a subject facility similarly delays in obtaining permits such as the permits we have been seeking in connection with our plan to engage in the mining of taconite ore in minnesota or unanticipated or costly conditions imposed on such permits could further delay a project or affect its profitability private parties might also bring claims against us for alleged property damage or personal injury resulting from the environmental impacts of our operations moreover legal requirements change frequently are subject to interpretation and have tended to become more stringent over time uncertainty regarding adequate pollution control levels testing and sampling procedures and new pollution control technology are factors that may increase our future compliance expenditures we are unable to predict the ultimate cost of future compliance with these requirements or their effect on our operations and we also cannot predict whether such costs can be passed on to customers through product price increases although we believe that we are in substantial compliance with all applicable laws and regulations legal requirements frequently change and are subject to interpretation new laws regulations and changing interpretations by regulatory authorities together with uncertainty regarding adequate pollution control levels testing and sampling procedures new pollution control technology and cost benefit analysis based on market conditions are all factors that may increase our future expenditures to comply with environmental requirements the cost of complying with existing laws or regulations as currently interpreted or reinterpreted in the future or with future laws or regulations may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

our manufacturing and recycling operations produce significant amounts of byproducts some of which are handled as industrial waste or hazardous waste for example our mills generate electric arc furnace eaf dust which the united states environmental protection agency usepa and other regulatory authorities classify as hazardous waste eaf dust requires special handling recycling and disposal 

in addition the primary feed materials for the shredders operated by our metals recycling operations are automobile hulks and obsolete household appliances approximately 20 of the weight of an automobile hulk consists of unrecyclable material known as shredder fluff after the segregation of ferrous and saleable nonferrous metals shredder fluff remains we along with others in the recycling industry interpret federal regulations to require shredder fluff to meet certain criteria and pass a toxic leaching test to avoid classification as a hazardous waste we also endeavor to remove hazardous contaminants from the feed material prior to shredding as a result we believe the shredder fluff we generate is not normally considered or properly classified as hazardous waste however if laws or regulations the interpretation of the laws or regulations or testing methods change with regard to eaf dust or shredder fluff we may incur significant additional expenditures 

the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act cercla or superfund enables usepa and state agencies to recover from owners operators generators and transporters the cost of investigation and cleanup of sites which pose serious threats to the environment or public health in connection with cercla and analogous state laws we may be required to clean up contamination discovered at our sites including contamination that may have been caused by former owners or operators of the sites conduct additional cleanup at sites where we have already participated in remediation efforts or to take remediation action with regard to sites formerly used in connection with our operations 

in addition we may be required to pay for or to pay a portion of the costs of remediation at sites to which we sent hazardous wastes for disposal notwithstanding that the original disposal activity may have complied with all regulatory requirements then in effect pursuant to cercla a potentially 

responsible party can be held jointly and severally liable for all of the cleanup costs associated with a thirdparty disposal site in practice a liable party often splits the costs of cleanup with other potentially responsible parties we have received notices from usepa state agencies and third parties that it has been identified as potentially responsible for the cost of investigating and cleaning up a number of thirdparty disposal sites in most cases many other parties are also named as potentially responsible parties based upon information currently available to us we do not believe the potential cost in connection with the remediation of these sites will have a material effect on our business 

because cercla can be imposed retroactively on shipments that occurred many years ago and because usepa and state agencies are still discovering sites that pose a threat to public health or the environment we can provide no assurance that we will not become liable in the future for significant costs associated with investigation and remediation of additional cercla clean up sites 

cercla including the superfund recycling equity act of 1999 limits the exposure of scrap metal recyclers for sales of certain recyclable material under certain circumstances however the recycling defense is subject to the conducting of reasonable care evaluations of current and potential consuming facilities 

increased regulation associated with climate change and greenhouse gas emissions could impose significant additional costs on both our steelmaking and metals recycling operations 

the united states government or various governmental agencies may introduce regulatory changes in response to the potential impacts of climate change international treaties or agreements may also result in increasing regulation of greenhouse gas emissions including the introduction of carbon emissions trading mechanisms any such regulation regarding climate change and greenhouse gas or ghg emissions could impose significant costs on our steelmaking and metals recycling operations and on the operations of our customers and suppliers including increased energy capital equipment environmental monitoring and reporting and other costs in order to comply with current or future laws or regulations concerning and limitations imposed on our operations by virtue of climate change and ghg emissions laws and regulations the potential costs of allowances offsets or credits that may be part of potential capandtrade programs or similar future regulatory measures are still uncertain any adopted future climate change and ghg regulations could negatively impact our ability and that of our customers and suppliers to compete with companies situated in areas not subject to such limitations from a medium and longterm perspective we are likely to see an increase in costs relating to our assets that emit significant amounts of greenhouse gases as a result of these regulatory initiatives these regulatory initiatives will be either voluntary or mandatory and may impact our operations directly or through our suppliers or customers until the timing scope and extent of any future regulation becomes known we cannot predict the effect on our financial condition operating performance and ability to compete 

risks related to the business 

our senior secured credit facility contains and any future financing agreements may contain restrictive covenants that may limit our flexibility 

restrictions and covenants in our existing debt agreements including our senior secured credit facility and any future financing agreements may impair our ability to finance future operations or capital needs or to engage in other business activities specifically these agreements restrict our ability to 

• incur additional indebtedness • pay dividends or make distributions with respect to our capital stock • repurchase or redeem capital stock 29 

• make some investments • create liens and enter into sale and leaseback transactions • make some capital expenditures • enter into transactions with affiliates or related persons • issue or sell stock of certain subsidiaries • sell or transfer assets and • participate in some joint ventures acquisitions or mergers a breach of any of the restrictions or covenants could cause a default under our senior secured credit facility our senior notes or our other debt a significant portion of our indebtedness then may become immediately due and payable if the default is not remedied 

under our senior secured revolving credit facility we are required to maintain certain financial covenants tied to our leverage liquidity and profitability in addition we are subject to a quarterly borrowing base requirement limiting the maximum availability of our senior secured revolver our ability to meet such covenants or borrowing restrictions can be affected by events beyond our control if a default were to occur the lenders could elect to declare all amounts then outstanding to be immediately due and payable and terminate all commitments to extend further credit if we are unable to repay those amounts the lenders could proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure such indebtedness we have pledged substantially all of our receivables and inventories and all shares of capital stock or other equity interests of the companys subsidiaries and intercompany debt held by us 

we may face significant price and other forms of competition from other steel producers and scrap processors which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operation or prospects 

the global markets in which steel companies and metals recyclers conduct business are highly competitive and have become even more so due in part to consolidations in recent years in the steel and the metal recycling industries and the recentongoing global economic downturn increased competition could cause us to lose market share increase expenditures or reduce pricing any one of which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations or prospects 

we are subject to significant risks relating to changes in commodity prices and may not be able to effectively protect against these risks 

we are exposed to commodity price risk during periods where we hold title to scrap metal products that we may hold in inventory for processing or resale prices of commodities including recycled metals can be volatile due to numerous factors beyond our control in an increasing price environment for raw materials competitive conditions may limit our ability to pass on price increases to our consumers in a decreasing price environment for processed recycled metal we may not have the ability to fully recoup the cost of raw materials that we procure process and sell to our customers in addition new entrants into the market areas we serve could result in higher purchase prices for raw materials and lower margins from our recycled metal we are unable to hedge positions in certain commodities such as recycled ferrous metal where no established futures market exists or where we may from time to time hedge our positions in certain nonferrous metal transactions we could incur losses thus our sales and inventory position will be vulnerable to adverse changes in commodity prices which could materially adversely impact our operating and financial performance 

we may be unable to pass on increases in the cost of ferrous materials and other raw materials to our customers which would reduce our earnings 

if from time to time we are unable to pass on periodic increases in ferrous resource and other raw material costs to our customers we will be less profitable we may not be able to adjust our product prices especially in the shortterm to recover the costs of prolonged increases in raw material prices our principal raw material is scrap metal derived primarily from junked automobiles industrial scrap railroad cars railroad track materials agricultural machinery and demolition scrap from obsolete structures containers and machines the prices for scrap are subject to market forces largely beyond our control including demand by us and international steel producers freight costs and speculation the prices for scrap have varied significantly may vary significantly in the future and do not necessarily fluctuate in tandem with the price of steel moreover some of our integrated steel producer competitors are not as dependent as we are on scrap as a part of their raw material melt mix which during periods of high scrap costs relative to the cost of blast furnace iron used by the integrated producers give them a raw material cost advantage over minimills in addition our operations require substantial amounts of other raw materials including various types of pig iron alloys refractories graphite electrodes oxygen natural gas and electricity the price and availability of which are also subject to market conditions 

the profitability of our metals recycling operations depends in part on the availability of an adequate source of supply 

we procure our recyclable metal inventory from numerous sources these suppliers generally are not bound by longterm contracts and have no obligation to sell recyclable metal to us in periods of low industry prices suppliers may elect to hold recyclable metal to wait for higher prices or intentionally slow their metal collection activities if a substantial number of suppliers cease selling recyclable metal to us we will be unable to recycle metal at desired levels and our results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected in addition a slowdown of industrial production in the united states as has recently occurred reduces the supply of industrial grades of metal to the metal recycling industry resulting in our having less recyclable metal available to process and market 

we may face risks associated with the implementation of our growth strategy 

our growth strategy subjects us to various risks as part of our growth strategy we may expand existing facilities build additional plants acquire other businesses and steel assets enter into joint ventures or form strategic alliances that we believe will complement our existing business these transactions will likely involve some or all of the following risks 

• the difficulty of competing for acquisitions and other growth opportunities with companies having materially greater financial resources than ours • the inability to realize anticipated synergies or other benefits expected from an acquisition • the difficulty of integrating the new or acquired operations and personnel into our existing businesses • the potential disruption to ongoing businesses • the diversion of financial resources to new or acquired businesses • the diversion of management attention from other business concerns to new or acquired businesses • the loss of key employees and customers of acquired businesses 31 

• the potential exposure to unknown liabilities • the inability of management to maintain uniform standards controls procedures and policies • the difficulty of managing the growth of a larger company • the risk of entering markets in which we have little experience • the risk of becoming involved in labor commercial or regulatory disputes or litigation related to the new or acquired business • the risk of becoming more highly leveraged • the risk of contractual or operational liability to other venture participants or to third parties as a result of our participation • the inability to work efficiently with joint venture or strategic alliance partners and • the difficulties of terminating joint ventures or strategic alliances such future initiatives or business transactions may not improve our competitive position and business prospects as anticipated and if they do not our sales and earnings may not only not be enhanced they could be significantly reduced 

technology operating and startup risks as well as commodity market risks associated with our mesabi nugget ironmaking project may prevent us from realizing its anticipated benefits and could result in a loss of all or a part of our investment 

while we and certain of our current and former joint venture partners built and operated a successful small scale pilot plant on the mesabi iron range in minnesota for the production of a cost effective iron nugget using kobe steels proprietary itmk3® ironmaking process there are technology operational market and startup risks associated with the startup of our worlds first full scale commercial nugget plant utilizing this technology although we believe this full scale plant will be capable of consistently producing highquality iron nuggets for use as a scrap substitute feed stock in our steelmaking operations and in sufficient quantities and at a cost that will compare favorably with the cost of steel scrap and other more conventional scrap substitute products including pig iron there can be no assurance that these expectations will be achieved we have encountered and may from time to time encounter cost overruns systems or process difficulties or quality control problems or output restrictions as a result our capital costs could increase the expected cost benefits from the development of this iron nugget product could be diminished or lost and we could lose all or a substantial portion of our investment in the project we could also encounter commodity market risk if during a sustained period the cost to manufacture the nuggets is greater than projected or if the relative market price of scrap and other scrap substitutes for which this iron nugget product is intended as a lower cost substitute is lower than projected which could render our nuggets noneconomical moreover we are undertaking certain ancillary ventures related to the ironmaking process such as our nearby mesabi mining facility for which we have been and are continuing to seek operating permits to allow us to mine taconite ore for use in the production of nuggets mining is a business in which we have no previous experience and which is also subject to possible permitting and environmental risks and uncertainties 

we are subject to litigation which could adversely affect our profitability  

we are involved in various routine litigation matters including administrative proceedings regulatory proceedings governmental investigations environmental matters and commercial and construction contract disputes 

we are also involved along with eight other steel manufacturing companies in a class action antitrust complaint filed in federal court in chicago illinois that alleges a conspiracy to fix raise maintain and stabilize the price at which steel products were sold in the united states starting in 2005 by artificially restricting the supply of such steel products all but one of the complaints purport to be brought on behalf of a class consisting of all direct purchasers of steel products between january 1 2005 and the present the other complaint purports to be brought on behalf of a class consisting of all indirect purchasers of steel products within the same time period in addition on december 28 2010 we and the other codefendants were served with a substantially similar complaint in the circuit court of cocke county tennessee purporting to be on behalf of indirect purchasers of steel products in tennessee the case has been removed to federal court all complaints seek treble damages and costs including reasonable attorney fees pre and postjudgment interest and injunctive relief on january 2 2009 steel dynamics and the other defendants filed a joint motion to dismiss all of the direct purchaser lawsuits on june 12 2009 however the court denied the motion the parties are currently conducting discovery related primarily to class certification matters due to the uncertain nature of litigation we cannot presently determine the ultimate outcome of this litigation however we have determined based on the information available at this time that there is not presently a reasonable possibility as that term is defined in asc 4502020 that the outcome of these legal proceedings would have a material impact on our financial condition results of operations or liquidity 

although not presently necessary or appropriate to make a dollar estimate of exposure to loss if any in connection with the above matter we may in the future determine that a loss accrual is necessary although we may make loss accruals if and as warranted any amounts that we may accrue from time to time could vary significantly from the amounts we actually pay due to inherent uncertainties and the inherent shortcomings of the estimation process the uncertainties involved in litigation and other factors additionally an adverse result could have a material effect on our financial condition results of operations and liquidity 

unexpected equipment failures may lead to production curtailments or shutdowns  

interruptions in our production capabilities could adversely affect our production costs products available for sales and earnings during the affected period in addition to equipment failures our facilities are also subject to the risk of catastrophic loss due to unanticipated events such as fires explosions or violent weather conditions our manufacturing processes are dependent upon critical pieces of steelmaking equipment such as our furnaces continuous casters and rolling equipment as well as electrical equipment such as transformers this equipment may on occasion be out of service as a result of unanticipated failures we have experienced and may in the future experience material plant shutdowns or periods of reduced production as a result of such equipment failures 

some of our operations present significant risk of injury or death 

the industrial activities conducted at our facilities present significant risk of serious injury or death to our employees customers or other visitors to our operations notwithstanding our safety precautions including our material compliance with federal state and local employee health and safety regulations while we have in place policies and procedures to minimize such risks we may nevertheless be unable to avoid material liabilities for an injury or death even though we maintain workers compensation insurance to address the risk of incurring material liabilities for injury or death there can be no assurance that the insurance coverage will be adequate or will continue to be available on the terms acceptable to us or at all which could result in material liabilities for an injury or death 

governmental agencies may refuse to grant or renew some of our licenses and permits 

we must receive licenses permits and approvals from state and local governments to conduct certain of our operations such as our mesabi mining operations or to develop or acquire new facilities governmental agencies often resist the establishment of certain types of facilities in their communities including scrap metal collection and processing facilities and there may be environmental objections or concerns raised by governmental agencies or private citizens there can be no assurance that future approvals licenses and permits will be granted or that we will be able to maintain and renew the approvals licenses and permits we currently hold in all our operations and failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition

operating statement classifications 

net sales net sales from our operations are a factor of volumes shipped product mix and related pricing we charge premium prices for certain grades of steel product dimensions certain smaller volumes and for valueadded processing or coating of the steel products except for our steel fabrication operations segment we recognize revenue from sales and the allowance for estimated returns from these sales at the time the title of the product is transferred to the customer provision is made for estimated product returns and customer claims based on estimates and actual historical experience net sales from steel fabrication operations are recognized from construction contracts utilizing a percentageofcompletion method which is based on the percentage of steel consumed to date as compared to the estimated total steel required for each contract 

costs of goods sold our costs of goods sold represent all direct and indirect costs associated with the manufacture of our products the principal elements of these costs are scrap and scrap substitutes which represent the most significant single component of our consolidated costs of goods sold steel direct and indirect labor and related benefits alloys zinc transportation and freight repairs and maintenance utilities most notably electricity and natural gas and depreciation 

selling general and administrative expenses selling general and administrative expenses consist of all costs associated with our sales finance and accounting and administrative departments these 

costs include among other items labor and related benefits professional services insurance premiums property taxes profit sharing and amortization of intangible and other assets 

interest expense net of capitalized interest interest expense consists of interest associated with our senior credit facilities and other debt net of interest costs that are required to be capitalized during the construction period of certain capital investment projects

overview 

we are one of the largest steel producers and one of the largest metals recyclers in the united states based on a current estimated annual steelmaking capability of 64 million tons and actual metals recycling shipping volumes during 2011 and 2010 of 59 million gross tons and 52 million gross tons of ferrous materials respectively and 11 billion pounds and 961 million pounds of nonferrous metals respectively our steel production during 2011 and 2010 excluding the techs was 52 million tons and 47 million tons respectively the primary sources of our revenues are from the manufacture and sale of steel products processing and sale of recycled ferrous and nonferrous metals and to a lesser degree fabrication and sale of steel joist and decking products our operations are managed and reported based on three operating segments steel operations metals recycling and ferrous resources operations and steel fabrication operations 

during 2011 we had net sales of 80 billion gross profit of 9315 million 12 and operating income of 5848 million 7 as compared to net sales of 63 billion gross profit of 6757 million 11 and operating income of 3648 million 6 during 2010 and net sales of 40 billion gross profit of 3991 million 10 and operating income of 1195 million 3 during 2009 

net income attributable to steel dynamics inc was 2781 million or 122 per diluted share in 2011 compared with 1407 million or 064 per diluted share in 2010 and a net loss of 81 million or 004 per diluted share in 2009 

during 2011 as the domestic economy continued to show signs of improvement we experienced further increased sales volumes and pricing resulting in increased gross profit across all reporting segments in comparison to 2010 steel operations experienced overall improved customer order volume and pricing with the most impactful demand improvements in 2011 as in 2010 in our sheet and special barquality steel products as the automotive transportation industrial and agricultural and construction equipment markets continued to strengthen steel operations shipping volumes improved 9 and overall steel pricing increased 16 on a per ton basis resulting in 2011 operating profit from steel operations increasing over that of 2010 by 50 to 6581 million operating income of our metals recycling ferrous resources segment increased in 2011 to 266 million as compared to 197 million in 2010 at omnisource our metals recycling operations within our metals recycling and ferrous resources segment ferrous and nonferrous metals sales volume and pricing increased as demand continued to improve in 2011 in conjunction with increases in domestic and international steel mill utilization rates and other production increases however there was margin percentage compression in both ferrous and nonferrous metals that offset much of the sales volume and pricing gains resulting in operating profit at omnisource increasing slightly in 2011 compared to 2010 

during 2010 we experienced improved net sales compared to 2009 driven by the general improvement of the domestic economy resulting in increasing customer demand and pricing for our products steel operations experienced overall improved customer order volume and pricing the most impactful demand improvement in 2010 versus 2009 was in our sheet and special barquality steel 

products as the automotive transportation industrial and agricultural and construction equipment markets showed signs of strengthening operating income in our steel operations for 2010 was up 2436 million or 124 compared with that of 2009 due to the improved volumes and pricing our metals recycling operations experienced improved shipping volumes and pricing of both ferrous and nonferrous metals in 2010 as demand improved due in large part to domestic and international steel production utilization rates increasing as compared to 2009 as a result of much stronger metals recycling operations as well as those of iron dynamics operating income in our metals recycling and ferrous resources operations increased 244 million to 197 million compared with 2009 the construction of the mesabi nugget facility was completed in 2009 and initial production of iron nuggets commenced january 2010 during 2010 mesabi nugget produced 75000 metric tons of ironnuggets for use by our own steel mills 

2012 outlook 

looking ahead to 2012 we are optimistic regarding a continued slow but steady growth in the us economy which could result in increased volumes compared to 2011 for all of our operations we believe steel consumption will continue to grow in the automotive transportation energy industrial agricultural and heavy equipment sectors we believe residential and nonresidential construction activity has likely reached its bottom and may continue to show some modest growth the fruition of these combined factors could result in an improved operating environment for all our segments in the coming year 

our focus will continue to be on disciplined cost control gross margin optimization and prudent growth opportunities while continuing to manage risk in an uncertain economic environment our current estimated 2012 cash allocation plan includes the investment of between 2250 and 2500 million in capital expenditures in our existing and announced operations 

segment operating results 2011 vs 2010  dollars in thousands  



1 other consists of the results of subsidiary operations that are below the quantitative thresholds required for reportable segments as well as unallocated corporate accounts including profit sharing 



steel operations steel operations consist of our five electricarc furnace minimills producing steel from steel scrap utilizing continuous casting automated rolling mills and various downstream finishing facilities including the techs operations collectively our steel operations sell directly to end users and service centers these products are used in numerous industry sectors including the automotive construction commercial transportation agriculture and industrial machinery markets during 2011 2010 and 2009 our steel operations accounted for 61 61 and 63 respectively of our external net sales operating income for steel operations increased 2183 million or 50 to 6581 million in 2011 versus 2010 this increase is due to increases in overall sales volumes of 9 with long products increasing 22 as well as increases in average selling prices of 122 per ton shipped which were only partially offset by less significant increases in raw material costs 

steel operations shipping volumes for the respective periods were as follows 



sheet products our flat roll division sells a broad range of sheet steel products such as hot rolled cold rolled and coated steel products including a large variety of specialty products such as light gauge hot rolled galvanized galvalume® and painted products the techs operations comprised of three galvanizing lines also sells specialized galvanized sheet steels used in nonautomotive applications sheet products represented 64 of our steel segments shipped tons in 2011 as compared to 68 in 2010 and 71 in 2009 

long products our structural and rail division sells structural steel beams and pilings and is also designed to produce and sell a variety of standard and premiumgrade rail for the railroad industry our engineered bar products division primarily sells special bar quality and merchant bar quality rounds and roundcornered squares our roanoke bar division sells billets and merchant steel products including angles plain rounds flats and channels steel of west virginia primarily sells merchant beams channels and specialty structural steel sections 

net sales for the steel segment increased in 2011 by 11 billion or 27 compared to 2010 steel segment shipments were up 9 in 2011 compared to 2010 due to the overall improved domestic economic climate as steel mill utilization improved to approximately 74 in 2011 as compared to 70 in 2010 with increased automotive heavy equipment agricultural and trailer demand additionally while service center and customer inventories continued to remain at historically low levels increases in enduser order activity directly impacted our own orders sheet product shipments increased 4 in 2011 compared to 2010 while long products increased 22 shipments in 2011 at engineered bar products and steel of west virginia increased 12 and 27 respectively although the nonresidential construction market continued to remain slow we saw some improvement in sales and order entry at our structural and rail division in 2011 as compared to 2010 including 117000 rail tons sold in 2011 versus 55000 rail tons in 2010 we continue to realize market share gains in rail and plan to further expand rail shipments in 2012 

our 2011 average steel operations segment selling price per ton shipped including intracompany shipments increased 122 compared with 2010 sheet products 2011 average selling price per ton shipped increased 123 compared with 2010 consistent with overall industry pricing and long products 

average selling prices increased 114 per ton compared with 2010 as demand also improved in the long products market especially in those served by our engineered bar products division and steel of west virginia 

steel operations average selling prices and volumes 

metallic raw materials used in our electric arc furnaces represent our single most significant manufacturing cost our metallic raw material cost per net ton consumed in our steel operations increased 71 in 2011 compared with 2010 during 2011 2010 and 2009 respectively our metallic raw material costs represented 68 62 and 52 of our steel operations manufacturing costs excluding the operations of the techs which purchases rather than produces the steel it further processes the lower relationship of scrap costs to total costs in 2009 is due to a much lower cost per ton of metallic raw materials consumed in 2009 during the depths of the recession 



metals recycling and ferrous resources operations this operating segment includes our metals recycling operations omnisource our liquid pig iron production facility iron dynamics idi and our minnesota iron operations our metals recycling and ferrous resources operations segment accounted for 35 35 and 31 of our external net sales in 2011 2010 and 2009 respectively operating income for the metals recycling and ferrous resources operations segment increased 69 million in 2011 to 266 million 

metals recycling and ferrous resources shipping volumes during the respective periods were as follows 



metals recycling our metals recycling operations omnisource represent our metals sourcing and processing operations and are the most significant source of revenues and earnings in this segment these operations sell ferrous metals to steel mills and foundries and nonferrous metals such as copper brass aluminum and stainless steel to among others ingot manufacturers copper refineries and mills smelters and specialty mills our metals recycling operations represented 95 96 and 96 of this segments net sales during 2011 2010 and 2009 and 664 million 657 million and 169 million of this segments operating income for these same periods respectively 

during 2011 metals recycling recorded sales of 39 billion on shipments of 59 million gross tons of ferrous metals and 11 billion pounds of nonferrous metals compared with sales of 30 billion on shipments of 52 million gross tons of ferrous and 9524 million pounds of nonferrous metals during 2010 sales prices of ferrous and nonferrous metals increased 18 and 9 respectively in 2011 versus 2010 the increased volume and pricing of our ferrous metals is directly impacted by the increase in both domestic and global steel mill utilization during 2011 the metals recycling operations provided approximately 52 of the steel scrap purchased by our steel mills this represented 43 of the metals recycling operations ferrous shipments for 2011 while similar amounts were 42 for 2010 and 39 for 2009 

metals recycling operating income increased 739000 to 664 million in 2011 as compared to 2010 the increase in ferrous and nonferrous selling prices were more than offset by increased unprocessed scrap metal procurement costs thus resulting in reduced metals margins per unit sold 

ferrous resources our ferrous resource operations consist of our two ironmaking initiatives iron dynamics idi a liquid pig iron production facility and our minnesota iron operations consisting of an iron nugget production facility and planned operations to supply the nugget facility with its primary raw material iron concentrate idi primarily produces liquid pig iron which is used as a scrap substitute raw material input exclusively at our flat roll division our minnesota iron operations consists of mesabi nugget owned 81 by us our planned future iron mining operations which is currently in the permitting process mesabi mining and our planned iron tailings operations mining resources owned 80 by us the construction of the mesabi nugget facility was completed in 2009 and initial production of iron nuggets commenced january 2010 throughout 2010 and 2011 we have refined this pioneering production process and changed equipment configurations to increase production and plant availability the facilitys anticipated annual production capacity is 500000 metric tons in 2011 and 2010 mesabi nugget produced 156000 and 75000 metric tons of ironnuggets respectively for use by our own steel mills we are currently constructing the iron tailings operation which is expected to start up in the third quarter of 2012 this operation is planned to provide iron ore tailings to be concentrated for use by mesabi nugget as a lowcost iron concentrate to the nugget production process losses from our minnesota iron operations reduced our net income in 2011 by approximately 340 million approximately 70 million more than in 2010 when the location commissioned initial startup the increased losses in 2011 were due to the continued startup efforts and decreased market selling prices in 2011 as pig iron market prices decreased increases in the operating income of idi in 2011 over those in 2010 more than offset the increased losses of our minnesota iron operations 



our steel fabrication operations represent the companys new millennium building systems plants located throughout the united states and northern mexico revenues from these plants are generated from the fabrication of trusses girders steel joists and steel decking used within the nonresidential construction industry steel fabrication operations accounted for 3 3 and 4 of our external net sales during 2011 2010 and 2009 respectively the operating loss for the segment was 66 million in 2011 compared to 123 million in 2010 excluding a 128 million impairment charge and 64 million in 2009 

net sales for the segment increased by 990 million or 56 in 2011 compared to 2010 as our selling volumes increased 32 to 218000 tons in 2011 and our average steel fabrication operations selling price per ton shipped increased 190 or 18 in 2011 as compared to 2010 our volume growth can be attributed to some modest growth within the nonresidential construction market as a whole our organic gains in market share as well as our expansion into the south and southwest during 2011 while we saw increased order entry sales volumes and pricing and margins in the fabrication segment in 2011 versus 2010 the nonresidential construction market continues to be at depressed levels we anticipate that if the nonresidential market further develops it may be slowly we are well positioned to grow with our expanded national footprint as we anticipate continuing to develop our market presence and penetration in the western portion of the united states 

the purchase of various steel products is the largest single cost of goods sold item for our steel fabrication operations during 2011 2010 and 2009 the cost of steel products purchased represented 70 of the total cost of manufacturing for our steel fabrication operations while the cost of steel increased in 2011 as compared to 2010 by 99 per ton as the increase in selling prices outpaced the increase in input costs and sales volume increased the segments gross profit increased 164 million or 136 in 2011 versus 2010

consolidated results 2011 vs 2010 

selling general and administrative expense sga selling general and administrative expenses including profit sharing and amortization of intangible assets were 3467 million during 2011 as compared to 2981 million during 2010 an increase of 486 million or 16 during 2011 and 2010 selling general and administrative expenses represented approximately 4 and 5 of net sales respectively the percentage decrease is primarily a result of increased net sales in 2011 compared with the prior year as measured against certain fixed cost components in selling general and administrative expenses the increase in sga expenses in 2011 compared to 2010 relates primarily to increased profit sharing expenses and incentive compensation which together were 368 million more in 2011 than in 2010 in conjunction with companys increased profitability during 2011 amortization of intangible assets decreased 56 million or 12 during 2011 compared to 2010 due to the accelerated amortization methods used for intangible assets related to customer and scrap generator relationships 

interest expense net of capitalized interest during 2011 gross interest expense increased 15 million or 1 to 1787 million and capitalized interest decreased 52 million or 75 to 17 million as compared to 2010 the interest capitalization that occurred during these periods resulted from the interest required to be capitalized with respect to construction activities at our various operating segments which were not as significant in 2011 

other income expense net other income net was 165 million during 2011 as compared to 189 million during 2010 with interest income of 45 million in 2011 versus 41 million in 2010 

income taxes during 2011 our income tax expense was 1586 million as compared to 839 million during 2010 our effective income tax rate before noncontrolling interests was 374 and 393 during 2011 and 2010 respectively the lower effective income tax rate in 2011 is due primarily to additional permanent deductible items in 2011 and a reduction of the impact of noncontrolling interest losses due to the higher 2011 income 

included in the 646 million balance of unrecognized tax benefits at december 31 2011 are potential benefits of 246 million that if recognized would affect the effective tax rate in addition to the unrecognized tax benefits we had 161 million accrued for the payment of interest and penalties at december 31 2011 we recognize interest and penalties related to our tax contingencies on a netoftax 

basis in income tax expense during 2011 we recognized interest expense of 31 million net of tax and penalties of 35000 

we file income tax returns in the us federal jurisdiction as well as income tax returns in various state jurisdictions the internal revenue service irs is currently examining our federal income tax returns for the years 2004 through 2009 at this time we do not believe we will have any significant examination adjustments that would result in a material change to our financial position or results of operations it is reasonably possible that the amount of unrecognized tax benefits could change in the next twelve months as a result of state and federal income tax audits based on the current audits in process the payment of taxes as a result of audit settlements could be in an amount from zero to 23 million by the end of 2012 with few exceptions including those discussed above the company is no longer subject to federal state and local income tax examinations by tax authorities for years ended before 2008 

consolidated results 2010 vs 2009 

net income was 1407 million or 064 per diluted share during 2010 compared with net loss of 82 million or 004 per diluted share in 2009 net sales in 2010 increased 23 billion or 59 to 63 billion as compared to sales of 40 billion achieved during 2009 and our 2010 gross margin percentage was 11 during 2010 as compared to 10 during 2009 during 2010 we experienced improved net sales compared to 2009 driven by the general improvement of the domestic economy resulting in increasing customer demand and pricing for our products 

steel operations experienced overall improved customer order volume 31 and pricing 112 per ton sold—17 resulting in a 53 increase in sales in 2010 to 40 billion as compared to 2009 the most impactful demand improvement in 2010 versus 2009 was in our sheet and special barquality steel products as the automotive transportation industrial agricultural and construction equipment markets showed signs of recovery our metallic raw material cost per ton consumed increased 107 per ton in 2010 as compared to 2009 as a result primarily of the improved volumes our operating income in our steel operations for 2010 was up 2436 million or 124 compared with that of 2009 

our metal recycling ferrous resources operations experienced improved shipping volumes of both ferrous 43 and nonferrous 23 metals and pricing in our metals recycling operations in 2010 as compared to 2009 as demand improved due in large part to domestic and international steel production utilization rates increasing as compared to 2009 as a result of much stronger metals recycling operations as well as those of iron dynamics operating income in our metals recycling and ferrous resources operations increased 244 million to 197 million compared with 2009 the construction of the mesabi nugget facility was completed in 2009 and initial production of iron nuggets commenced january 2010 during 2010 mesabi nugget produced 75000 metric tons of ironnuggets for use by our own steel mills the mesabi nugget startup losses reduced our net income by approximately 270 million in 2010 versus a reduction in net income of less than approximately 60 million in 2009 when the location was being constructed 

our steel fabrication operations sales increased 12 to 1774 million in 2010 as compared to 2009 as volumes increased 13 and pricing decreased slightly in a down nonresidential construction market operating losses in 2010 were 123 million excluding a 128 million impairment charge compared to 64 million in 2009 with the increased losses in 2010 due primarily to higher steel raw material costs per ton in 2010 as compared to 2009 

selling general and administrative expenses selling general and administrative expenses including profit sharing and amortization of intangible assets were 2981 million during 2010 as compared to 2795 million during 2009 an increase of 186 million or 7 our sga expenses represented 5 of our total net sales during 2010 compared to 7 during 2009 the lower percentage in 2010 is due primarily to the increase in net sales in 2010 compared with the prior years as measured 

against certain fixed cost components in sga costs the increase in sga expenses in 2010 compared to 2009 relates primarily to profit sharing expenses that were 225 million more in 2010 than in 2009 in conjunction with the increased profitability during 2010 amortization of intangible assets decreased 80 million or 15 during 2010 compared to 2009 due to the finalization in 2009 of the amortization of certain finitelived intangible assets related to the acquisition of recycle south and the accelerated amortization methods used for intangible assets related to customer and scrap generator relationships 

impairment charges after the purchase of additional fabrication assets in the fourth quarter of 2010 and evaluating the future use of existing fabrication facilities we determined that the carrying value of certain fixed assets at our idled south carolina fabrication facility exceeded their fair value as determined utilizing market and cost approaches the resulting impairment charge of 128 million was recorded within the steel fabrication reporting segment 

interest expense net of capitalized interest during 2010 gross interest expense increased 149 million to 1772 million and capitalized interest decreased 139 million to 70 million when compared to 2009 the increase in gross interest expense for 2011 compared to 2010 is primarily a result of our issuance of 3500 million of 7 5  8  senior notes due 2020 in march 2010 the interest capitalization that occurred during these periods resulted from the interest required to be capitalized with respect to construction activities at our various operating segments the decrease in capitalized interest in 2010 as compared to 2009 was due primarily to the completion of construction at our mesabi nugget facility during the fourth quarter of 2009 

other income expense net other income was 189 million during 2010 as compared to 36 million during 2009 we earned interest income of 41 million during 2010 versus 14 million in 2009 during 2009 the company terminated an interest rate swap contract and recorded other expense of 13 million 

income taxes during 2010 our income tax expense was 839 million as compared to income tax benefit of 72 million during 2009 our effective income tax rate before noncontrolling interests was 393 and 396 during 2010 and 2009 respectively 

liquidity and capital resources 

our business is capital intensive and requires substantial expenditures for among other things the purchase and maintenance of equipment used in our steelmaking and finishing operations and to remain in compliance with environmental laws our shortterm and longterm liquidity needs arise primarily from capital expenditures working capital requirements principal and interest payments related to our outstanding indebtedness and dividends we have met these liquidity requirements with cash provided by operations issuances of common stock longterm borrowings and state and local grants 

working capital during 2011 our operational working capital position representing amounts invested in trade receivables and inventories less current liabilities other than income taxes payable and debt increased 878 million to 13 billion compared to december 31 2010 trade receivables of which over 98 were current or less than 60 days past due increased 1006 million or 16 during 2011 to 7228 million our largest customer is an affiliated company heidtman steel which represented 5 of our outstanding trade receivables at december 31 2011 and december 31 2010 trade receivables increased during 2011 due to increased sales from higher product prices and volumes in the fourth quarter of 2011 as compared to the fourth quarter of 2010 as days sales outstanding has remained consistent total inventories increased in 2011 by 855 million or 8 to 12 billion at december 31 2011 workinprocess and finished goods inventories increased 463 million with steel volumes increasing by 42000 tons our trade payables and general accruals increased 983 million or 18 

during 2011 the increase in trade payables is a reflection of the increased production activities and commodity raw material pricing and purchasing prior to december 31 2011 compared to that at december 31 2010 the increase in general accruals is due primarily to the increase in accrued profit sharing and incentive compensation due to the increased profitability during 2011 when compared to 2010 

capital investments during 2011 we invested 1670 million in property plant and equipment of which 440 million was within our steel operations and 1031 million related to our metals recycling and ferrous resource operations we believe these capital investments will benefit our net sales and related cash flows as each project reaches completion and attains appropriate operational metrics our current estimated 2012 cash allocation plan includes the investment of between 2250 and 2500 million in capital expenditures in our existing and announced operations 

capital resources and longterm debt during 2011 our total outstanding debt decreased 67 million to 24 billion our total longterm debt to capitalization ratio representing our longterm debt including current maturities divided by the sum of our longterm debt redeemable noncontrolling interest and total stockholders equity was 501 at december 31 2011 as compared to 528 at december 31 2010 

in september 2011 the company entered into a new fiveyear senior secured revolving credit facility facility which provides up to 11 billion of available borrowing in the form of a revolver with the original option to increase that level by an additional 4000 million however after issuing a 2750 million term loan in january 2012 the expansion amount is now 1250 million the revolver is available to fund working capital capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes the facility is guaranteed by certain of the companys subsidiaries and is secured by substantially all of the companys and its whollyowned subsidiaries receivables and inventories and by pledges of all shares of the companys whollyowned subsidiaries capital stock on january 11 2012 the company expanded the facility by adding a 2750 million term loan that matures on september 30 2016 term loan quarterly principal payments under the term loan are required to be made in amounts ranging from 125 to 375 of the original principal amount with the unpaid principal balance of approximately 1580 million due on the maturity date the company used the proceeds of the term loan together with cash on hand to fund the january 2012 purchase of 2797 million of the companys 7 3  8  senior notes due 2012 we executed the partial tender offer for our 7000 million 7 3  8  senior notes due november 2012 in order to mitigate a portion of the refinancing risk later in the year nearly 40 of the holders offered their notes in the tender 

the companys revolver must be the lesser of 11 billion less other applicable commitments such as letters of credit and other secured debt as defined within the facility or the sum of 85 of the companys eligible accounts receivable and 65 of the companys eligible inventories less other applicable commitments at december 31 2011 the company had 11 billion of availability on the revolver 165 million of outstanding letters of credit and other obligations which reduce availability and there were no borrowings outstanding 

the facility contains financial covenants and other covenants that limit or restrict our ability to make capital expenditures incur indebtedness permit liens on property enter into transactions with affiliates make restricted payments or investments enter into mergers acquisitions or consolidations conduct asset sales pay dividends or distributions and enter into other specified transactions and activities our ability to borrow funds within the terms of the revolver is dependent upon our continued compliance with the financial and other covenants 

the financial covenants under our facility state that we must maintain an interest coverage ratio of not less than 250100 our interest coverage ratio is calculated by dividing our lasttwelve trailing months ltm consolidated adjusted ebitda earnings before interest taxes depreciation 

amortization and certain other noncash transactions as allowed in our facility by our ltm gross interest expense we must also maintain minimum liquidity through maturity or repayment of our 7 3  8  senior notes due 2012 the minimum liquidity covenant required is determined by the sum of unrestricted cash and revolver availability as defined in the credit agreement being at least 1500 million plus the outstanding amount of the 7000 million senior notes due 2012 which was 850 million at december 31 2011 and 5703 million after the january 2012 partial tender in addition a net debt as defined in the credit agreement to consolidated ltm adjusted ebitda ratio leverage ratio of not more than 500100 must be maintained if the net debt to ebitda ratio exceeds 350100 at any time our ability to make restricted payments as defined in the credit agreement which includes cash dividends to stockholders and share purchases among other things is limited at december 31 2011 our interest coverage ratio and net debt leverage ratio were 492100 and 236100 respectively and our minimum liquidity is almost 16 billion we were therefore in compliance with these covenants at december 31 2011 and we anticipate we will remain in compliance during 2012 

cash dividends we declared cash dividends of 875 million or 040 per common share 010 per common share each quarter during 2011 and 651 million or 030 per common share 0075 per common share per quarter during 2010 we paid cash dividends of 819 million and 650 million during 2011 and 2010 respectively our board of directors along with executive management approves the payment of dividends on a quarterly basis the determination to pay cash dividends in the future will be at the discretion of our board of directors after taking into account various factors including our financial condition results of operations outstanding indebtedness current and anticipated cash needs and growth plans in addition the terms of our senior secured revolving credit agreement and the indentures relating to our senior notes restrict the amount of cash dividends we can pay 

other our ability to meet our debt service obligations and reduce our total debt will depend upon our future performance which in turn will depend upon general economic financial and business conditions along with competition legislation and regulatory factors that are largely beyond our control in addition we cannot assure you that our operating results cash flow access to credit markets and capital resources will be sufficient for repayment of our indebtedness in the future we believe that based upon current levels of operations and anticipated growth cash flow from operations together with other available sources of funds including additional borrowings under our senior secured credit facility through its term which expires in september 2016 will be adequate for the next twelve months for making required payments of principal and interest on our indebtedness funding working capital requirements and anticipated capital expenditures 

during 2011 we received benefits from state and local governments in the form of real estate and personal property tax abatements and credits of approximately 52 million based on our current abatements and incentive credits and utilizing our existing longlived asset structure we estimate the remaining annual benefit to our future operations to be approximately 41 million 27 million 22 million 18 million 680000 470000 and 260000 during the years 2012 through 2018 respectively 

contractual obligations and other longterm liabilities 

we have the following minimum commitments under contractual obligations including purchase obligations as defined by the us securities and exchange commission a purchase obligation is defined as an agreement to purchase goods or services that is enforceable and legally binding and that specifies all significant terms including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased fixed minimum or variable price provisions and the approximate timing of the transaction other longterm liabilities are defined as longterm liabilities that are reflected on our balance sheet under generally accepted accounting principles based on this definition the following table includes only those contracts which include fixed or minimum obligations it does not include normal purchases which are made in the ordinary course of business the following table provides aggregated information about outstanding contractual obligations and other longterm liabilities as of december 31 2011 in thousands

other matters 

inflation 

we believe that inflation has not had a material effect on our results of operations 

environmental and other contingencies 

we have incurred and in the future will continue to incur capital expenditures and operating expenses for matters relating to environmental control remediation monitoring and compliance during 2011 we incurred costs related to the monitoring and compliance of environmental matters in the amount of approximately 352 million and capital expenditures related to environmental compliance of approximately 11 million over 87 of the costs incurred during 2011 for monitoring and compliance were related to the normal transportation of certain types of waste produced in the steelmaking process in accordance with legal requirements we incurred combined environmental remediation costs of approximately 230000 at all of our facilities during 2011 we have an accrual of 20 million net of 15 million of escrowed funds recorded for environmental remediation related to our metals recycling operations and 29 million related to mesabi nugget and mesabi mining we believe apart from our dependence on environmental construction and operating permits for our existing and proposed manufacturing facilities that compliance with current environmental laws and regulations is not likely to have a materially adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or liquidity however environmental laws and regulations have changed rapidly in recent years and we may become subject to more stringent environmental laws and regulations in the future such as the impact of united states government or various governmental agencies introducing regulatory changes in response to the potential of climate change 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

managements discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states we review the accounting policies we use in reporting our financial results on a regular basis the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities we evaluate the appropriateness of these estimations and judgments on an ongoing basis we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources results may differ from these estimates due to actual outcomes being different from those on which we based our assumptions we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 

revenue recognition and allowance for doubtful accounts except for our steel fabrication operations segment we recognize revenues from sales and the allowance for estimated returns from these sales when the title of the product transfers upon shipment provision is made for estimated product returns and customer claims based on estimates and actual historical experience if the historical data used in our estimates does not reflect future returns and claims trends additional provision may be necessary our steel fabrication operations segment recognizes revenues from construction contracts using a percentage of completion methodology based on steel tons used on completed units to date as a percentage of estimated total steel tons required by each contract steel fabrication operations accounted for 3 3 and 4 of our net sales in 2011 2010 and 2009 respectively 

we are exposed to credit risk in the event of nonpayment by our customers which in steel operations are principally intermediate steel processors and service centers that sell our products to numerous industry sectors including the automotive agriculture construction commercial transportation and industrial machinery markets our metals recycling operations sell ferrous metals to steel mills and foundries and nonferrous metals such as copper brass aluminum and stainless steel to among others ingot manufacturers copper refineries and mills smelters and specialty mills we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments based on known credit risks historical loss experience and current economic conditions affecting our customers we mitigate our exposure to credit risk by performing ongoing credit evaluations and taking further action when necessary such as requiring letters of credit or other security interests to support the receivable from our customer if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate resulting in the impairment of their ability to make payments additional allowance may be required 

inventories we record inventories at lower of cost or market cost is determined principally on a firstin firstout basis 

impairments of longlived tangible and finitelived intangible assets we review longlived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable impairment losses are recorded on longlived assets used in operations when indicators of impairment are present and the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than the assets carrying amounts the impairment loss is measured by comparing the fair value of the asset to its carrying amount we consider various factors and determine whether an impairment test is necessary including by way of examples a significant and prolonged deterioration in operating results and projected cash flows significant changes in the extent or manner in which an asset is used technological advances with respect to assets which would potentially render them obsolete our strategy and capital planning and the economic climate in markets to be served 

after the purchase of additional fabrication assets in the fourth quarter of 2010 and determining the future use of existing fabrication facilities the company determined that the carrying value of certain fixed assets at its idled south carolina fabrication facility exceeded their fair value as determined utilizing market and cost approaches the resulting impairment charge of 128 million was recorded within the steel fabrications reporting segment in 2010 

goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets 

our goodwill relates to various business combinations and is allocated to the following reporting units at december 31in thousands 



at least once annually or when indicators of impairment exist we perform an impairment test for goodwill goodwill is allocated to various reporting units which are generally one level below our operating segments we utilize a twostepped approach to measuring goodwill impairment the first step of the test determines if there is potential goodwill impairment in this step we compare the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying amount which includes goodwill the fair value of the reporting unit is determined by using an estimate of future cash flows utilizing a riskadjusted discount 

rate to calculate the net present value of future cash flows and assessing its reasonableness by using a market approach based upon an analysis of valuation metrics of comparable peer companies if the carrying amount exceeds the fair value we perform the second step of the test which measures the amount of impairment loss to be recorded if any in the second step we compare the carrying amount of the goodwill to the implied fair value of the goodwill based on the net fair value of the recognized and unrecognized assets and liabilities of the reporting unit if the implied fair value is less than the carrying value an impairment loss is recorded to the extent that the fair value of the goodwill is less than its carrying value 

key assumptions used to determine the estimated fair value of each reporting unit under the discounted cash flows method include a expected cash flows for the fiveyear period following the testing date including market share sales volumes and prices costs to produce and estimated capital needs b an estimated terminal value using a terminal year growth rate determined based on the growth prospects of the reporting unit and c a discount rate based on managements best estimate of the aftertax weighted average cost of capital management considers historical and anticipated future results general economic and market conditions the impact of planned business and operational strategies and all available information at the time the fair values of its reporting units are estimated 

goodwill and other intangible assets acquired in recent transactions are naturally more susceptible to impairment primarily due to the fact that they are recorded at fair value based on recent operating plans and economic conditions present at the time of acquisition consequently if operating results andor economic conditions deteriorate shortly after an acquisition it could result in the impairment of the acquired assets a deterioration of economic conditions may not only negatively impact the estimated operating cash flows used in our cash flow models but may also negatively impact other assumptions used in our analyses including but not limited to the estimated cost of capital andor discount rates additionally we are required to ensure that assumptions used to determine fair value in our analyses are consistent with the assumptions a hypothetical marketplace participant would use as a result the cost of capital andor discount rates used in our analyses may increase or decrease based on market conditions and trends regardless of whether our actual cost of capital has changed therefore we may recognize an impairment of an intangible asset or assets in spite of realizing actual cash flows that are approximately equal to or greater than our previously forecasted amounts 

our other indefinitelived intangible assets relate to trademarks acquired through various business combinations and is allocated to the following reporting units at december 31 2011 and 2010 in thousands 



at least annually or when indicators of impairment exist we perform an impairment test for indefinitelived intangible assets through the comparison of the fair value of the specific intangible asset with its carrying amount the fair value of the intangible asset is determined by using an estimate of future cash flows attributable to the asset and a riskadjusted discount rate to compute a net present value of future cash flows if the fair value is less than the carrying value an impairment loss is recorded in an amount equal to the excess in carrying value 

our fourth quarter 2011 annual goodwill and indefinitelived intangible asset impairment analyses did not result in any impairment charges management does not believe that it is reasonably likely that our reporting units will fail step one of a goodwill impairment test in the near term the omnisource reporting units fair value exceeded its carrying value by more than 10 however our analysis contemplates performance improvements similar to historical levels the discount rate used in the analysis is a critical assumption one in which a minor change can have a significant impact on the 

estimated fair value a 100 basis point increase in the discount rate used in the omnisource analysis would not result in an impairment charge for the reporting unit we will continue to monitor operating results within all reporting units throughout the upcoming year in an effort to determine if events and circumstances warrant further interim impairment testing otherwise all reporting units will again be subject to the required annual impairment test during the fourth quarter of 2012 changes in judgments and estimates underlying our analysis of goodwill for possible impairment including expected future operating cash flows and discount rate could decrease the estimated fair value of our reporting units in the future and could result in an impairment of goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets 

income taxes we are required to estimate our income taxes as a part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements this requires us to estimate our actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatments of items for tax and accounting purposes these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities which are included within our consolidated balance sheet we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely we must establish a valuation allowance we establish reserves to reduce some or all of the tax benefit of any of our tax positions at the time we determine that the positions become uncertain we adjust these reserves including any impact on the related interest and penalties in light of changing facts and circumstances such as the progress of a tax audit a number of years may elapse before a particular matter for which we have established a reserve is audited and finally resolved the number of years with open tax audits varies depending on the tax jurisdiction the tax benefit that has been previously reserved because of a failure to meet the more likely than not recognition threshold would be recognized in our income tax expense in the first interim period when the uncertainty disappears settlement of any particular issue would usually require the use of cash 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

market risk 

in the normal course of business we are exposed to interest rate changes our objectives in managing exposure to interest rate changes are to limit the impact of these rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower overall borrowing costs to achieve these objectives we primarily use interest rate swaps to manage net exposure to interest rate changes related to our portfolio of borrowings 

the following table represents the principal cash repayments and related weightedaverage interest rates by maturity date for our longterm debt as of december 31 2011 taking into consideration the effects of the 2797 million cash tender for a portion of the 7000 million 7 3  8  senior notes and issuance of a 2750 million term loan both in january 2012 in thousands 



commodity risk 

in the normal course of business we are exposed to the market risk and price fluctuations related to the sale of our products and to the purchase of raw materials used in our operations such as metallic raw materials electricity natural gas iron concentrate fuel and zinc our risk strategy associated with product sales has generally been to obtain competitive prices for our products and to allow operating results to reflect market price movements dictated by supply and demand 

our risk strategy associated with the purchase of raw materials utilized within our operations has generally been to make some commitments with suppliers relating to future expected requirements for some commodities such as electricity natural gas and its transportation fuel and zinc certain of these commitments contain provisions which require us to take or pay for specified quantities without regard to actual usage for periods of up to 24 months for physical commodity requirements and for up to 9 years for commodity transportation requirements our commitments for these arrangements with 

take or pay or other similar commitment provisions for the years ending december 31 are as follows in thousands 



we utilized such take or pay requirements during the past three years under these contracts we believe that production requirements will be such that consumption of the products or services purchased under these commitments will occur in the normal production process we also purchase electricity consumed at our flat roll division pursuant to a contract which extends through december 2012 the contract designates 160 hours annually as interruptible service and establishes an agreed fixedrate energy charge per millkwh consumed for each year through the expiration of the agreement 

in our metals recycling operations we have certain fixed price contracts with various customers and suppliers for future delivery of nonferrous metals our risk strategy has been to enter into base metal financial contracts with the goal to protect the profit margin within certain parameters that was contemplated when we entered into the transaction with the customer or vendor at december 31 2011 we had a cumulative unrealized loss associated with these financial contracts of 12 million substantially all of which have a settlement date in 2012 we believe the customer contracts associated with the financial contracts will be fully consummated

  metals recycling our metals recycling operations represent our metals sourcing and processing operations and are the most significant source of income in this segment as evidenced by the increased diversification of our revenue streams beginning in 2008 we have significantly grown our metals recycling business through the acquisitions of omnisource corporation in october 2007 and recycle south llc in june 2008 our metals recycling operations sell ferrous metals to steel mills and foundries and nonferrous metals such as copper brass aluminum and stainless steel to ingot manufacturers copper refineries and mills smelters and specialty mills our metals recycling operations also sell ferrous metals to our own steel mills as a raw material these shipments to our steel mills represented 31 23 and 27 of our metals recycling operations net sales in 2008 2009 and 2010 respectively our metals recycling operations represented 97 of this segments net sales in 2008 and 96 in both 2009 and 2010 

  ferrous resources our ferrous resource operations consist of the revenues and expenses associated with our liquid pig iron facility iron dynamics idi our ironnugget manufacturing facility mesabi nugget and our potential future mining operations mesabi mining idi primarily produces liquid pig iron which is used as a scrap substitute raw material input exclusively at our flat roll division the construction of the mesabi nugget facility was completed in 2009 and 

initial production of iron nuggets commenced january 2010 throughout the year we have been refining the production process and changing equipment configurations as needed in order to increase production and plant availability during 2010 mesabi nugget produced 75000 metric tons of ironnuggets for use by our own steel mills during 2011 we anticipate reaching much improved sustainable production levels moving towards the facilitys anticipated annual production capacity of 500000 metric tons 

steel fabrication operations our steel fabrication operations includes new millennium building systems plants which fabricate steel joists trusses girders and decking used within the nonresidential construction industry steel fabrication operations accounted for 5 4 and 3 of our consolidated net sales in 2008 2009 and 2010 respectively 

current environment 

the prevailing global economic conditions improved during 2010 from the historically low levels of 2009 we experienced increased order volumes and pricing in our operations specifically we benefited from improvements in end user demand in the automotive truck and trailer energy heavy equipment and other original equipment manufacturing industries in addition we have increased our penetration into the rail markets during 2010 we continue to face challenges in our structural steel products and our fabricated joist and decking products as the nonresidential construction industry continues to experience lower levels of demand however we believe that we are well positioned in these operations to take advantage of these markets as this industry improves 

our financial strategy includes a commitment to continue to improve our financial leverage metrics and provide for long termsustainable growth while maintaining appropriate liquidity levels our commitment to these goals drives a focus on controlling costs and maximizing per unit margins managing capital investments and prudent growth in support of our goals in march 2010 we issued 350 million of 7 5  8  senior notes due 2020 the net proceeds were used to repay amounts outstanding under our revolving credit facility and for general corporate purposes our liquidity increased 403 million to 11 billion at the end of 2010 

competitive strengths  business strategies 

we believe our financial strategy coupled with our competitive advantages of maintaining a low highly variable cost structure producing a diversified valueadded product offering controlling a secure supply of recycled ferrous metals entitywide entrepreneurial culture and having an experienced senior management team positions us well to continue to strengthen our leadership position during the economic recovery 

one of the lowest cost steel producers in the united states stateoftheart facilities  continue to maintain low production costs 

we are focused on continuing to maintain and enhance one of the lowest operating cost structures in the north american steel industry our low operating costs are primarily a result of our efficient plant designs and operations our high productivity rate such as our productivity rate of approximately 3 man hours per hot band ton produced at our flat roll divisions mill low ongoing maintenance cost requirements and strategic locations near our customers and sources of our primary raw material steel scrap 

we will continue to strive to optimize the use of our equipment enhance our productivity and explore new technologies to further improve our unit costs of production at each of our facilities we believe that as one of the lowest cost producers in each of our primary operating segments we are able to better manage through cyclical and noncyclical downturns such as the periods of 2009 and 2010 and to consistently maximize our profitability we continuously seek to maximize the variability of our 

cost structure and to reduce per unit and fixed costs our incentive compensation plans at all employee levels are based on both divisional and consolidated company performance incentive compensation is designed to reward high productivity and efficient use of physical resources and capital employed 

secure supply of ferrous raw materials  develop metals recycling and ferrous resources business platform 

we maintain a secure supply of ferrous raw material resources through the benefit of our metals recycling operations omnisource corporation as well as through our current ironmaking facilities iron dynamics and mesabi nugget ferrous materials represent our singlelargest manufacturing cost and generally represent between 55 and 65 of our steel production costs excluding the techs during 2009 and 2010 omnisource provided our steel operations with 47 of its ferrous scrap requirements based on volume iron dynamics and mesabi nugget provided our flat roll division with 10 of the mills iron requirements through the transfer of liquid pig iron hot briquetted iron and iron nuggets which are higherquality energysaving ferrous raw materials as mesabi nugget production increases it will supply our steel operations with additional iron requirements 

we expect global and domestic demand for steel products to continue to increase and we believe there will be supply constraints of various commodities including ferrous materials during periods of economic downturn such as 2009 and 2010 significant reductions in available prime industrial scrap were a direct result of low domestic manufacturing rates additionally as consumers utilize assets for longer periods of time and replace items less frequently the flow of other sources of scrap such as auto bodies appliances and other goods is also constrained in addition the world demand for domestic ferrous resources has increased in nearly every year in the past decade impacting scrap availability as exports increase to developing countries 

we believe our metals recycling and ferrous resources operations not only provide us with a quality cost effective and secure raw material platform but we also believe it provides us with significant revenue generating and profitability opportunities that allow for funding of future growth whether in resources or in other ventures we intend to continue to participate in the development of new technologies to increase the effectiveness of our metals recycling recovery capabilities and to develop new strategic relationships in order to increase the amount of unprocessed metals we have the ability to source and eventually sell 

diversified product mix  expand product offerings 

our current products in our steel segment include hot rolled cold rolled galvanized galvalume® and painted sheet steel various structural steel beams and rails special bar quality steel and various merchant steel products including beams angles flats and channels in addition we offer steel finishing and fabrication services in the metals recycling segment our products include an array of both ferrous and nonferrous scrap processing scrap management transportation and brokerage products and services finally our steel fabrication segment produces steel joists and steel decking materials this diversified mix of products enables us to access a broad range of enduser markets serve a broad customer base and helps mitigate our market exposure to any one product or enduser market in addition our valueadded product offerings help to balance our exposure to commodity grade products 

we will continue to seek additional opportunities to further expand our range of products whether through the expansion of existing facilities greenfield projects or acquisitions that may become available in both the domestic steel and recycling industries maximization of our mesabi nugget project as well as the expansions and upgrades of existing facilities are important steps in pursuing our strategy of product line expansion 

strategic geographic locations  enter new geographic markets 

the locations of our steelmaking facilities near sources of scrap materials and near our customer base allow us to realize freight savings for inbound scrap as well as for outbound steel products destined for our customers recycled steel scrap and iron units represent the most significant component of our cost of steel manufacturing our metals recycling facilities are located in the upper midwest and southeastern united states and thus further expand our geographic service area we believe these regions account for a majority of the total steel scrap produced in the united states our steel products are also more cost effectively available through our locations in pittsburgh pa and jeffersonville in due to river access in october 2010 we purchased certain joist assets from another manufacturer which now enables us to have access to western and southwestern markets and national accounts through this acquisition of facilities in hope arkansas fallon nevada and juarez mexico 

we may seek to enter new markets in strategic geographic locations that offer attractive growth opportunities 

experienced management team and unique corporate culture  foster entrepreneurial culture 

our senior management team is highly experienced and has a proven track record in the steel and metals recycling industries managements objectives are closely aligned with our stockholders through meaningful stock ownership positions and performancebased compensation programs that are correlated to the companys profitability our corporate culture is also unique for the steel industry we emphasize decentralized decisionmaking and have established incentive compensation programs specifically designed to reward employee teams for their efforts toward enhancing productivity improving profitability and controlling costs 

we intend to continue to foster our entrepreneurial corporate culture and emphasize decentralized decision making and responsibility while rewarding teamwork innovation and operating efficiency we will also continue to focus on maintaining the effectiveness of our incentivebased bonus plans that are designed to enhance overall productivity and align the interests of our management and employees with our stockholders 

2011 outlook 

looking ahead to 2011 we are optimistic regarding slow but steady growth in the us economy which could result in increased volumes compared to 2010 for both our steel and metals recycling operations we expect steel consumption to grow in 2011 in the automotive transportation energy industrial agricultural and construction equipment sectors we believe residential and nonresidential construction activity has likely reached its bottom the fruition of these combined factors should result in an improved operating environment for all our segments in the coming year 

our focus will continue to be on disciplined cost control revenue optimization and prudent growth opportunities while continuing to manage risk in an uncertain economic environment we currently plan to spend less than 200 million in capital investments during 2011 we believe our current operations and sources of cash are adequate to meet the cash requirements associated with these possible investments 

industry segments 

we have three reporting segments steel operations metals recycling and ferrous resources operations and steel fabrication operations please refer to item 8 consolidated financial statements and supplementary data for additional information 



our steel operations segment consists of steelmaking and coating operations the following chart summarizes the locations and the current capacities of our facilities 



  



1 excess billet tonnage available for sale note capacities represent manufacturing capabilities based on mill configuration and related employee support these capacities do not represent expected volumes in a given year in addition estimates of mill capacity particularly rolling capacity are highly dependent on the specific product mix manufactured each of our mills can and do roll many different types and sizes of products therefore our capacity estimates assume a typical product mix 

sheet products 

our sheet steel products are produced by both our flat roll division which consists of our flat roll mill galvanizing and painting facilities in butler indiana our galvanizing and painting facilities in jeffersonville indiana and the techs our pittsburgh pennsylvaniabased galvanizing company which operates three galvanizing facilities galvtech metaltech and nextech 

our flat roll mill manufactures flat rolled hot rolled cold rolled and coated steel products we produced 22 million tons and 27 million tons at this facility in 2009 and 2010 respectively our products are characterized by high quality surface characteristics precise tolerances and light gauge in addition this mill has achieved iso 90012008—ansiisoasq q90012008 certification we believe that these certifications have enabled us to serve a broad range of customers who may require certifications for themselves or to satisfy the endusers of our steel products 

our flat roll mill has two twinshell electric arc furnaces which enable us to melt scrap in one vessel while tapping the other vessel and refilling it with steel scrap and iron units to make it ready for the next heat this results in more heats and greater productivity we have three ladle metallurgy stations two continuous thinslab casters which produce twoinch slabs and two tunnel furnaces our hot rolling mill which progressively reduces the slab in thickness consists of a sevenstand rolling mill capable of rolling sheet steel down to 10 mm with excellent surface quality which enables us to access markets previously available only to more expensive cold finished material 

located within our flat roll mill we have a hot rolled galvanizing line capable of coating steel in gauges from 044 to 160 inches and in widths ranging from 39 to 61 inches also within our flat roll mill we have a cold rolled galvanizing line capable of coating steel in gauges from 014 to 068 inches and in widths ranging from 39 to 61 inches our onsite paint line receives material directly from our other processing lines and is capable of painting hot rolled galvanized coil cold rolled coil and cold rolled galvanized coil in gauges of 010 to 070 inches and in widths ranging from 39 to 61 inches we believe this enables us to realize substantial savings in the production of painted coil and pass along savings and efficiencies to our customers when compared to remote offsite coating facilities 

in jeffersonville indiana we have a cold rolled galvanizing facility located within the clark maritime centre on the ohio river this facility is capable of coating cold rolled steel in gauges from 008 to 045 inches and in widths between 39 and 60 inches this gauge range is lighter than that available from our butler facility and creates further expansion of our value added product offerings our flat roll mill provides our jeffersonville facility with cold rolled material

the following table summarizes the types of sheet products we sold during the respective years 



hot rolled products our flat roll mill produces hot rolled products that include a variety of high quality low and medium carbon and highstrength lowalloy hot rolled bands in widths from 39 to 61 inches and in thicknesses from 500 inches down to 043 inches we also produce an array of lighter gauge hot rolled products including high strength low alloy and medium carbon steels these products are suitable for automobile suspension arms frames wheels and other unexposed parts in auto and truck bodies truck trailer and recreational vehicle parts and components mechanical and structural steel tubing gas and fluid transmission piping building and construction products rail cars ships 

barges and other marine equipment agricultural equipment and farm implements lawn garden and recreation equipment industrial machinery and shipping containers and highway guard rails we believe that our basic hot rolled material has shape characteristics that exceed those of other thinslab flat roll steel minimills and compares favorably with those of the integrated steel mills 

we sell a portion of our hot rolled coils produced at our flat roll mill directly to endusers or to intermediate steel processors and service centers where they may be pickled cold rolled annealed tempered galvanized or painted by those customers the rest of the hot rolled coils are directed to our cold mill where we add value to this product through our own pickling cold rolling annealing tempering galvanizing and painting processes a portion of our cold rolled production is shipped to our jeffersonville indiana galvanizing facility 

cold rolled products cold rolled steel is hot rolled steel that has been further processed through a pickler and then passed through a rolling mill until the desired gauge or thickness and other physical properties have been achieved cold rolling reduces gauge and hardens the steel and when further processed through an annealing furnace and a temper mill improves uniformity ductility and formability cold rolling can also impart various surface finishes and textures cold rolled steel is used in exposed steel applications that demand higher surface quality or finish such as exposed automobile and appliance panels as a result of higher processing costs cold rolled prices are typically higher than hot rolled prices cold rolled material is often coated or painted 

coated products hot rolled or cold rolled steel can be coated with zinc to render it corrosionresistant and to improve its paintability galvanized galvannealed galvalume® electrogalvanized and aluminized products are types of coated steels these are also the highest valueadded sheet products because they require the greatest degree of processing and tend to have the strictest quality requirements coated steel is used in high volume applications such as automobiles household appliances roofing and siding heating and air conditioning equipment air ducts switch boxes chimney flues awnings garbage cans and food containers our paint lines in butler and jeffersonville incorporate stateoftheart coil coating equipment with quick color change capability and online color matching which allows us to produce prepainted steel products that are used in many of these same end products 

we also produce hot rolled pickled and oiled hot rolled galvanized hot rolled galvannealed cold rolled galvanized cold rolled galvannealed and fully processed cold rolled sheet as a result of our lighter gauge hot rolling capabilities our hot rolled galvanized and galvannealed steel products are capable of replacing products that have traditionally only been available as more expensive cold rolled galvanized or cold rolled galvannealed steel this material is typically used in transportation products building products such as raised garage door panels heating and cooling products appliances furniture and lighting equipment 

customers steel processors and service centers typically act as intermediaries between primary steel producers and the many enduser manufacturers that require further processing of hot rolled coils the additional processing performed by the intermediate steel processors and service centers include pickling galvanizing cutting to length slitting to size leveling blanking shape correcting edge rolling shearing and stamping we expect that our intermediate steel processor and service center customers will remain an integral part of our customer base the location of our jeffersonville facility on the ohio river also creates opportunities for market expansion into other geographic regions the techs produces galvanized flat rolled products that are similar to those produced by our flat roll division and sold to a similar customer base each of the techs facilities specializes in the galvanizing of specific types of flat rolled steels in generally nonautomotive applications servicing a variety of customers in the heating ventilation and air conditioning hvac construction agriculture and consumer goods markets we exported 2 of our sheet products during both 2009 and 2010

we produce an array of ferrous products used in foundry and steel mill applications for use in our own steel mills or for resale to other customers through a variety of methods including sorting shearing cutting torching baling shredding briquetting and breaking our major ferrous products include heavy melting steel busheling bundled scrap shredded scrap and other scrap metal products such as steel turnings and cast iron these products vary in properties or attributes related to cleanness size of individual pieces and residual alloys these factors are determined by the specific needs and requirements of the consumer and affect the individual products relative value we process nonferrous products including aluminum brass copper stainless steel and other nonferrous metals for use in foundry mill refining and smelting applications our superior aluminum alloys operations produce specification aluminum alloys in the form of ingots sows and molten metal in addition we provide transportation logistics truck rail and river barge management services marketing brokerage and consulting services related to the scrap industry 

customers we sell processed ferrous scrap to endusers such as steel producing minimills integrated steelmakers foundries secondary smelters and metal brokers who aggregate materials for other large users most of our ferrousscrap customers purchase processed scrap through negotiated spot sales contracts which establish a quantity purchase for the month the price we charge for ferrous scrap depends upon market demand and transportation costs as well as the quality and grade of the scrap in many cases our selling price also includes the cost of transportation to the enduser 

we sell processed nonferrous scrap to endusers such as specialty steelmakers foundries aluminum sheet and ingot manufacturers copper refineries and smelters brass and bronze ingot manufacturers wire and cable producers utilities and telephone networks 

markets according to the institute of scrap recycling industries isri approximately 85 million metric tons and 71 million metric tons of recycled iron and steel including stainless and alloys were processed in the united states during 2008 and 2009 respectively in addition approximately 18 million metric tons and 8 million metric tons of nonferrous scrap including aluminum copper lead and zinc were processed during 2008 and 2009 respectively scrap is a global commodity influenced by conditions in a number of industrialized and emergingmarkets throughout asia europe and north america isri estimates that approximately 19 million metric tons and 20 million metric tons of ferrous scrap were exported from the united states in 2008 and 2009 respectively nonferrous exports from the united states were estimated by isri to be 32 million metric tons and 27 million metric tons in 2008 and 2009 respectively 

scrap metal supplies are generated from a variety of sources industrial scrap or home scrap is generated from steel processing and manufacturing facilities utilizing steel in their production process obsolete scrap including post consumer waste demolition of steel structures and automobiles represent a significant source of scrap generation we do not purchase a material amount of scrap metal from a single source or from a limited number of major sources 

competitors the markets for scrap metals are highly competitive both in the purchase of raw scrap and the sale of processed scrap with regard to the purchase of raw scrap we compete with numerous independent recyclers as well as smaller scrap companies engaged only in collecting industrial scrap in many cases we also purchase unprocessed scrap metal from smaller scrap dealers and other processors successful procurement of materials is determined primarily by the price offered by the purchaser for the raw scrap and the proximity of our processing facility to the source of the raw scrap both ferrous and nonferrous scrap sells as a commodity in both national and international markets which are affected by relative economic conditions currency fluctuations and the availability and cost of transportation competition for sales of processed scrap is based primarily on the price quality and location of the scrap metals as well as the level of service provided in terms of reliability and timing of delivery 

we also face potential competition for sales of processed scrap from other producers of steel products such as integrated steel mills and steel minimills some of which are vertically integrated in the scrap metals recycling business as a number of steel manufacturers currently operate their own scrap yards in addition other steel mills may compete with us in attempting to secure scrap supply through direct purchasing from our scrap suppliers scrap metal processors also face competition from substitutes for prepared ferrous scrap such as prereduced iron pellets hot briquetted iron pig iron iron carbide and other forms of processed iron the availability and relative prices of substitutes for ferrous scrap could result in a decreased demand for processed ferrous scrap and could result in lower prices andor lower demand for our scrap products 

the industry is highly fragmented with many smaller familyowned companies although omnisource also competes with a number of national and global companies each of which has multiple locations in areas in which omnisource also operates these larger entities include the david j joseph company a subsidiary of nucor corporation sims metal management ferrous processing and trading co aleris international cmc a division of commercial metals company newell recycling schnitzer steel and darlington shredding in addition omnisource competes with many regional scrap companies no single scrap metals recycler has a significant market share in the domestic market 

ferrous resources 

iron dynamics 

iron dynamics developed a process of producing liquid pig iron and hot briquetted iron hbi that serves as a substitute for a portion of the metallic raw material mix that goes into our electric arc furnaces to produce steel direct reduced iron dri is a metallic product made from millscale and iron ore fines that has been reduced in a rotary hearth furnace using natural gas and coal the reduction method employed by iron dynamics uses coal as the reducing agent the dri is either compacted by briquetters to form hbi or is processed further to produce liquid pig iron hbi can be immediately used in our melting furnaces or stockpiled for later use liquid pig iron is tapped from iron dynamics submerged arc furnace and immediately transferred in ladles to the flat roll mills melt shop where it is combined with scrap steel in the mills electric arc furnaces during 2010 approximately 79 of our production was liquid pig iron 

during 2010 the plants primary focus was to maximize liquid pig iron production due to the inherent economic benefits achieved when the material is used in the steelmaking process such as reduced energy cost reduced materials cost and quicker melting cycles during 2010 iron dynamics produced 180000 metric tons 165000 metric tons in 2009 of liquid pig iron and 45000 metric tons 37000 metric tons in 2009 of hbi we have used and plan to use all of the facilitys output in our steelmaking operations 

mesabi nugget and mesabi mining 

mesabi nugget our ironmaking project at hoyt lakes minnesota is the worlds first commercial ironmaking facility to use the itmk3® process an ironnugget production technology pioneered by kobe steel ltd which kobe steel is licensing to the venture we hold an equity position of 2315 million or an 81 equity interest while kobe steel holds a 543 million or a 19 noncontrolling equity interest the project involved the construction of an ironnugget manufacturing facility which utilizes ironore concentrate coal and natural gas the construction of the facility was completed in 2009 and initial production of iron nuggets commenced january 2010 throughout the year we have been refining the production process and changing equipment configurations as needed in order to increase production and plant availability during 2010 mesabi nugget produced 75000 metric tons of ironnuggets for use by our own steel mills during 2011 we anticipate reaching much 

improved sustainable production levels moving towards the facilitys anticipated annual production capacity of 500000 metric tons we believe that this new business will be capable of providing a cost effective source of iron units to our steel mills that is of equal or higher quality than purchased pig iron 

we also plan to reopen an existing iron mine on the mesabi iron range and to construct a facility for concentrating iron ore we have purchased land on the mesabi iron range in minnesota that is expected to provide a longterm supply of iron ore in the future we plan to process the iron ore and use it as raw material feedstock for the nugget plant in total the capital cost of the mining project is currently estimated to be approximately 169 million mesabi mining is currently in the permitting process we believe we may receive the necessary permits near the end of 2011 which could then allow us to begin mining operations near the end of 2012 

sources availability and cost of steel raw materials 

scrap metals our principal raw material of our steel operations segment is scrap metal derived from among other sources home scrap generated internally at steel mills themselves industrial scrap generated as a byproduct of manufacturing and obsolete scrap recycled from endoflife automobiles appliances railroad cars and railroad track materials agricultural machinery and demolition scrap from obsolete structures containers and machines 

scrap typically comprises more than 80 of the metallic melt mix in electric arc furnace steelmaking in contrast to integrated mill steelmaking where the proportion of scrap has traditionally been approximately 25 to 35 depending upon the scrap substitute material that may be available from time to time and the relative cost of such material the percentage of scrap used in our steelmaking operations could be reduced in our metallic melt mix 

many variables can impact scrap prices all of which reflect the pushes and pulls of the supply demand equation these factors include the level of us new steel production for highquality lowresidual scrap is a byproduct of new steel manufacturing activity the level of exports of scrap from the united states the amount of obsolete scrap production and the effect of speculation on the amount of scrap offered on the market from time to time generally as domestic steel demand increases so does scrap demand and resulting scrap prices the reverse is also normally but not always true with scrap prices following steel prices downward when supply exceeds demand according to isris 2009 estimate scrap recyclers in the us recycled approximately 71 million metric tons of ferrous scrap including stainless and alloys 

the following table provides pricing per gross ton from american metal market and scrap price bulletin estimates for ferrous materials used in steel production 

the price of steel scrap as a commodity has tended to be volatile rising and falling with supply and demand and not always in lock step with or in proportion to the market price of new steel when scrap costs greatly accelerate this threatens one of the principal elements of a minimills traditional lower cost structure—the cost of its metallic raw material therefore having a lower cost alternative source of iron for a portion of a minimills melt mix if realizable would partially buffer the effects of high scrap prices and scrap price volatility with the growing proportion of electric furnace steelmaking both worldwide and domestically we believe that the benefit of developing a costeffective alternate iron source to augment scrap our primary raw material makes good economic sense in the long run 

iron units in addition to scrap direct reduced iron hot briquetted iron pig iron and ironnuggets are used in electric furnace minimill steel production during 2009 and 2010 we consumed 41 million tons and 52 million tons respectively of metallic materials in our steel making furnaces of which iron units other than scrap represented approximately 8 of the tons of this 8 our iron dynamics and mesabi nugget operations together supplied 79 of these iron units in 2010 



our steel fabrication operations primarily serve the nonresidential construction industry in october 2010 we purchased joist assets from another manufacturer including three plants located at hope arkansas fallon nevada and juarez mexico these new facilities when combined with our existing facilities operating in indiana florida and virginia allow us to service the entire us market by facilitating our fabrication operations expansion to serve construction markets in the southwest and the west additionally we are now positioned to service national accounts such as large retail chains 

we fabricate trusses girders steel joists and steel decking these products are sold to the nonresidential building components market total production of all products was 145000 tons and 164000 tons during 2009 and 2010 respectively our flat roll division and roanoke bar division supply a substantial portion of the steel utilized in these manufacturing operations 

products our fabrication operations produce steel building components including steel joists girders and trusses our individual joist products include bowstring arched scissor doublepitched and singlepitched joists our indiana florida and virginia plants also produce a full range of steel roof form and composite floor decking 

customers our fabrication primary customers are nonresidential steel fabricators other customers include metal building companies general construction contractors developers brokers and governmental entities our customers are located throughout the united states with a concentration in the eastern half of the country through our new locations at hope arkansas fallon nevada and juarez mexico we expect to facilitate and accelerate our fabrication operations expansion to serve us construction markets in the southwest and the west additionally this will allow us to better serve our customers that have a nationwide presence 

markets our fabrication operations primarily serve the nonresidential construction industry the continuing downturn in the nonresidential construction markets and the resultant demand for joist and deck products continues at a low level however we believe the longterm prospects for this business are sound because of the current market conditions we expect the ramping up of the newly acquired locations to proceed slowly as the market strengthens the steel joist and deck market in the united states was approximately 20 million tons in 2008 and decreased to 10 million tons in both 2009 and 2010 based on trade association estimates 

competitors our main competitors in the joist business are vulcraft a division of nucor corporation canam group quincy joist co joist structural and valley joist in the steel decking business new millenniums main competitors are vulcraft wheeling corrugating co quincy joist co consolidated systems inc and canam group 

energy resources 

electricity electricity is a significant input required in the electric arc furnaces in our steelmaking operations representing 7 and 5 of steel operations costs of goods sold in 2009 and 2010 respectively we have entered into a fixed price interruptible electricity supply agreement that extends through december 31 2012 for our flat roll division in butler indiana the contract allows our supplier to interrupt service in the event of an emergency or in response to various market conditions our structural and rail division and roanoke bar division purchase electricity at current market prices while the techs and steel of west virginia had negotiated fixed prices through 2010 our engineered bar products division has a combination of fixed pricing and market pricing for the various components of the electrical services demand charge energy charge riders etc 

gas we purchase a portion of our operations natural gas requirements at market prices and a portion by entering into hedging transactions on the futures markets for ultimate physical delivery in order to help minimize price volatility these contracts typically have duration of up to 24 months natural gas represented 3 and 2 of steel operations costs of goods sold in 2009 and 2010 respectively

environmental matters 

our steel operations metals recycling and ferrous resources operations and steel fabrication operations are subject to substantial and evolving local state and federal environmental health and safety laws and regulations concerning among other things emissions to the air discharges to surface and ground water and to sewer systems and the generation handling storage transportation treatment and disposal of toxic and hazardous substances our manufacturing operations are dependent upon both state and federal permits regulating discharges into the air or into the water in order to operate our facilities we believe that in all current respects our steel operations metals recycling and ferrous resources operations and steel fabrication operations are in material compliance with all provisions of federal and state laws concerning the environment and we do not currently believe that future compliance with such provisions will have a material adverse effect on our results of operations cash flows or financial condition 

since the level of enforcement of environmental laws and regulations or the nature of those laws that may be enacted from time to time are sometimes subject to changing social or political pressures our environmental capital expenditures and costs for environmental compliance may increase in the future in addition due to the possibility of unanticipated regulatory or other developments the amount and timing of future environmental expenditures may vary substantially from those currently anticipated the cost of current and future environmental compliance may also place us steel producers at a competitive disadvantage with respect to foreign steel producers which may not be required to undertake equivalent costs in their operations 

pursuant to the resource conservation and recovery act or rcra which governs the treatment handling and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes the united states environmental protection agency or us epa and authorized state environmental agencies conduct inspections of rcra regulated facilities to identify areas where there may have been releases of solid or hazardous constituents into the environment and require the facilities to take corrective action to remediate any such releases rcra also allows citizens to bring certain suits against regulated facilities for potential damages and clean up our steelmaking facilities are subject to rcra our manufacturing operations produce various byproducts some of which for example electric arc furnace or eaf dust are categorized as industrial or hazardous waste requiring special handling for disposal or for the recovery of metallics we collect such coproducts in approved baghouses and other facilities but we are also examining alternative reclamation technologies to recycle some of these products while we cannot predict the future actions of the regulators or other interested parties the potential exists for required corrective action at these facilities the costs of which could be substantial 

under the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act or cercla the us epa and in some instances private parties have the authority to impose joint and several liability for the remediation of contaminated properties upon generators of waste current and former site owners and operators transporters and other potentially responsible parties regardless of fault or the legality of the original disposal activity many states including indiana have statutes and regulatory authorities similar to cercla and to the us epa we have a number of waste handling agreements with various contractors to properly dispose of our electric arc furnace dust and certain other waste products of steelmaking however we cannot assure you that even if there has been no fault by us we may not still be cited as a waste generator by reason of an environmental clean up at a site to which our waste products were transported 

in addition to rcra and cercla there are a number of other environmental health and safety laws and regulations that apply to our facilities and may affect our operations by way of example and not of limitation certain portions of the federal clean air act clean water act toxic substances control act oil pollution act safe drinking water act and emergency planning and community righttoknow act as well as state and local laws and regulations implemented by the regulatory 

agencies apply to our facilities operations many of these laws allow both the governments and citizens to bring certain suits against regulated facilities for alleged environmental violations finally any steelmaking and metals recycling company could be subject to certain toxic tort suits brought by citizens or other third parties alleging causes of action such as nuisance negligence trespass infliction of emotional distress or other claims alleging personal injury or property damage 

employees 

our work force consisted of approximately 6180 full time employees at december 31 2010 of which approximately 11 were represented by collective bargaining agreements the largest group of unionized employees is at steel of west virginia the remaining unionized employees are located in 6 different omnisource metals recycling locations each of which has its own agreement we believe that our relationship with our employees is good

 item 1a risk factors 

  many factors could have an effect on our financial condition cash flows and results of operations we are subject to various risks resulting from changing economic environmental political industry business and financial conditions the factors described below represent our principal risks 

risks related to our industry 

our industry is affected by global economic factors including the risk of a recurrent recession 

our financial results are substantially dependent not only upon overall economic conditions in the united states in europe and in asia but also as they may affect one or more of the industries upon which we depend for the sale of our products a prolonged or a recurrent recession in the united states or globally could substantially decrease the demand for our products and adversely affect our business moreover many of our products are commodities subject to their own cyclical fluctuations in supply and demand in both metal consuming and metal generating industries including the construction industry metals industries have historically been vulnerable to significant declines in consumption and product pricing during prolonged periods of economic downturn such as during 2009 

and 2010 likewise the pace of domestic nonresidential construction activity has historically slowed significantly during economic downturns and is at historically low levels today 

our business is also dependent upon certain industries such as commercial and government construction energy metals service centers automotive petrochemical and original equipment manufacturing and these are also cyclical in nature therefore these industries may experience their own significant fluctuations in demand for our products based on such things as economic conditions energy prices consumer demand and infrastructure funding decisions by governments many of these factors are beyond our control as a result of the volatility in the industries we serve we may have difficulty increasing or maintaining our level of sales or profitability if the industries we serve were to suffer a recurrent downturn then our business may be further adversely affected 

our level of production and our sales and earnings are subject to significant fluctuations as a result of the cyclical nature of the steel industry and some of the industries we serve 

the steel manufacturing business is cyclical in nature and the price of the steel we make may fluctuate significantly due to many factors beyond our control the timing and magnitude of these price fluctuations are difficult to predict the sale of our manufactured steel products is directly affected by demand for our products in other cyclical industries such as the automotive oil and gas gas transmission residential and commercialindustrial construction commercial equipment rail transportation appliance agricultural and durable goods industries the domestic automotive industry which is a major consumer of new steel and a major generator of steel scrap has not yet fully recovered from the recent unprecedented downturn in demand economic difficulties stagnant economies supplydemand imbalances and currency fluctuations in the united states or globally could further decrease the demand for our products or increase the amount of imports of steel into the united states which would decrease our sales margins and profitability 

the scrap metal recycling industry has historically been and is expected to remain highly cyclical a prolonged period of low scrap prices or a fall in scrap metal prices could result in the weakening of inbound scrap flows and thereby reduced our ability to obtain process and sell recycled materials and this could have a material adverse effect on our metals recycling operations results 

scrap metal prices are volatile and operating results within the metals recycling industry in general have historically been cyclical and are expected to remain highly cyclical in nature similarly but not necessarily paralleling the price fluctuations in the steel business the purchase prices for automobile bodies and various other grades of obsolete and industrial scrap as well as the selling prices for processed and recycled scrap metals we utilize in our own manufacturing process or we resell to others through our metals recycling operations are also highly volatile as a metals recycler we may attempt to respond to changing recycled metal selling prices by adjusting the scrap metal purchase prices we pay to others but our ability to do this may be limited by competitive or other factors during periods of low scrap prices when inbound scrap flow may slow considerably as scrap generators hold onto their scrap in the hope of getting higher prices later conversely increased foreign demand for scrap due to economic expansion in countries such as china india and brazil can result in an outflow of available domestic scrap as well as higher scrap prices that cannot always be passed on to domestic scrap consumers further reducing the available domestic scrap flows and scrap margins all of which could adversely affect our sales and profitability 

imports of steel into the united states have in the past adversely affected and may yet again adversely affect us steel prices which could impact our sales margins and profitability 

excessive imports of steel into the united states as a result of excess world supply have in past years exerted and may again in the future exert downward pressure on us steel prices and may reduce or may negatively affect our ability to increase our sales margins and profitability us steel 

producers compete with many foreign producers including those in china competition from foreign producers is typically strong and is periodically exacerbated by weakening of the economies of certain foreign steelmaking countries greater steel exports to the united states tend to occur at depressed prices when steel producing countries experience periods of economic difficulty decreased demand for steel products or excess capacity 

in addition we believe the downward pressure on and periodically depressed levels of us steel prices in some recent years have been further exacerbated by imports of steel involving dumping and subsidy abuses by foreign steel producers some foreign steel producers are owned controlled or subsidized by foreign governments as a result decisions by these producers with respect to their production sales and pricing are often influenced to a greater degree by political and economic policy considerations than by prevailing market conditions realities of the marketplace or consideration of profit or loss however while some tariffs and quotas are periodically put in to effect for certain steel products imported from a number of countries that have been found to have been unfairly pricing steel imports to the us many of these are only shortlived when such tariffs or duties expire or if others are further relaxed or repealed or if relatively higher us steel prices make it attractive for foreign steelmakers to export their steel products to the united states despite the presence of duties or tariffs the resurgence of substantial imports of foreign steel could create downward pressure on us steel prices 

chinas current steelmaking overcapacity in relation to its steel consumption could have a material adverse effect on domestic and global steel pricing and could result in increased steel imports into the united states 

a significant factor in the worldwide volatility of steel pricing in recent years was the explosive growth in chinese steel consumption in relation to its domestic production which until the third quarter of 2008 had vastly outpaced that countrys capacity to produce steel in sufficient quantity to serve its internal demand the shortage of chinese domestic steel supply during this time period resulted not only in heightened chinese demand for imported steel and other raw materials with a consequent upward spiral in worldwide steel pricing for finished steel products but also led to a rapid and significant expansion of steel production capacity in china as well as many of the commodities supplies and services utilized in steelmaking however the subsequent drop in chinese steel consumption that began in 2008 and continued through 2010 in addition to the continued utilization of a large amount of outdated inefficient and government subsidized production capacity has resulted in a situation in which chinas steel producing capacity currently exceeds that countrys demand for many kinds of steel products that we produce making china a net exporter of millions of tons of steel in 2008 2009 and 2010 therefore a combination of a slowdown in chinas economic growth rate and steel consumption coupled with its own expansion of steelmaking capacity could result in a substantial further weakening of both domestic and global steel demand and steel pricing also should chinese steelmaking capacity remain the same or further increase or should its demand either not increase or further weaken china might not only remain a net exporter of steel but many asian and european steel producers whose steel output previously fed chinas steel import needs could find their way into the us market through increased steel imports causing a further erosion of margins or negatively impacting our ability to increase our prices 

the worldwide economic downturn that began in 2008 and the difficult conditions in the global industrial capital and credit markets that resulted have adversely affected and may continue to adversely affect our business and our industry as well as the industries of many of our customers and suppliers upon whom we are dependent 

many of the markets in which our customers participate such as the automotive consumer products original equipment manufacturing commercial residential and government construction and metals service center industries are also cyclical in nature and experience significant fluctuations in 

demand for our steel products based on economic conditions consumer demand raw material and energy costs and decisions by our government to fund or not fund infrastructure projects such as highways bridges schools energy plants railroads and transportation facilities many of these factors are beyond our control these markets are highly competitive to a large extent driven by enduse markets and may experience overcapacity all of which may affect demand for and pricing of our products 

a decline in consumer and business confidence and spending together with severe reductions in the availability and cost of credit as well as volatility in the capital and credit markets could adversely affect the business and economic environment in which we operate and the profitability of our business we are also exposed to risks associated with the creditworthiness of our suppliers and customers the availability of credit to fund or support the continuation and expansion of our customers business operation is curtailed or if the cost of that credit is increased the resulting inability of our customers or of their customers to access either credit or absorb the increased cost of that credit could adversely affect our business by reducing our sales or by increasing our exposure to losses from uncollectible customer accounts these conditions and a renewed disruption of the credit markets could also result in financial instability of some of our suppliers and customers the consequences of such adverse effects could include the interruption of production at the facilities of our customers the reduction delay or cancellation of customer orders delays or interruptions of the supply of raw materials we purchase and bankruptcy of customers suppliers or other creditors any of these events may adversely affect our cash flow profitability and financial condition 

volatility and major fluctuations in scrap metal and pig iron prices and our potential inability to pass such higher costs on to our customers may constrain operating levels and reduce profit margins 

steel producers require large amounts of raw materials including scrap metal and scrap substitute products such as pig iron pelletized iron and other supplies such as graphite electrodes and ferroalloys our vertical integration into the metals recycling business through our omnisource subsidiary and into the ironmaking business through our iron dynamics facility and the startup of our mesabi nugget operations should enable us to be our own supplier for some of our metallics requirements however we may still need to rely on other metallics and raw material suppliers as well as upon general industry supply conditions 

purchase prices for auto bodies scrap metal and scrap substitute products such as pig iron that we consume and selling prices for scrap and recycled metals that we sell to third parties are volatile and beyond our control while omnisource attempts to respond to changing recycled metal selling prices through adjustments to its metal purchase prices its ability to do so is limited by competitive and other market factors changing prices could potentially impact the volume of scrap metal available to us and the volume and realized margins of processed metals we sell 

the availability and prices of raw materials may also be negatively affected by new laws and regulations allocation by suppliers interruptions in production accidents or natural disasters changes in exchange rates worldwide price fluctuations and the availability and cost of transportation 

if prices for ferrous metallics and energy increase by a greater margin than corresponding price increases for the sale of our steel products we may not be able to recoup such cost increases from increases in the selling prices of steel products or our inability to pass on all or any substantial part of such cost increases through scrap or other surcharges or to provide for our customers needs because of the potential unavailability of key raw materials or other inputs may result in production curtailments or may otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations or prospects 

the cost and availability of electricity and natural gas are also subject to volatile market conditions 

steel producers like us consume large amounts of energy inasmuch as minimills melt steel scrap in electric arc furnaces and use natural gas to heat steel billets for rolling into finished products we rely on third parties for the supply of energy resources we consume in our steelmaking activities the prices for and availability of electricity natural gas oil and other energy resources are all also subject to volatile market conditions often affected by weather conditions as well as political and economic factors beyond our control as large consumers of electricity and gas we must have dependable delivery in order to operate accordingly we are at risk in the event of an energy disruption prolonged blackouts or brownouts or disruptions caused by natural disasters or by political considerations would substantially disrupt our production moreover much of our finished steel products is typically delivered by truck unforeseen fluctuations in the price of fuel attributable to fluctuations in crude oil prices would also have a negative impact on our costs or on the costs of many of our customers in addition changes in certain environmental regulations in the us including those that may impose output limitations or higher costs associated with climate change or greenhouse gas emissions legislation could substantially increase the cost of manufacturing and raw materials such as energy to us and other us steel producers 

fluctuations in the value of the united states dollar relative to other currencies may adversely affect our business  

fluctuations in the value of the dollar can be expected to affect our business a strong us dollar makes imported metal products less expensive potentially resulting in more imports of steel products into the us by our foreign competitors while a weak us dollar may have the opposite impact on imports 

compliance with and changes in environmental and remediation requirements could result in substantially increased capital requirements and operating costs 

existing laws or regulations as currently interpreted or as may be interpreted in the future as well as future laws or regulations may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

we are subject to comprehensive local state federal and international statutory and regulatory environmental requirements relating to among other things 

• the acceptance storage treatment handling and disposal of solid and hazardous waste • the discharge of materials into air • the management and treatment of wastewater and storm water • the remediation of soil and groundwater contamination • global climate change legislation or regulation • the need for and the ability to timely obtain air water or other operating permits • the remediation and reclamation of land used for iron mining • natural resource damages and • the protection of our employees health and safety compliance with environmental laws and regulations which affect both our steelmaking and our metals recycling and ironmaking operations is a significant factor in our business we are required to obtain and comply with environmental permits and licenses and failure to obtain or renew or the violation of any permit or license if not remedied could result in substantial fines and penalties 

suspension of operations or the closure of a subject facility similarly delays in obtaining permits or unanticipated or costly conditions imposed on such permits such as permits we are seeking in connection with our plan to engage in the mining of taconite ore close to our mesabi nugget facility in minnesota could delay a project or affect its profitability private parties might also bring claims against us for alleged property damage or personal injury resulting from the environmental impacts of our operations moreover legal requirements change frequently are subject to interpretation and have tended to become more stringent over time uncertainty regarding adequate pollution control levels testing and sampling procedures and new pollution control technology are factors that may increase our future compliance expenditures we are unable to predict the ultimate cost of future compliance with these requirements or their effect on our operations and we also cannot predict whether such costs can be passed on to customers through product price increases although we believe that we are in substantial compliance with all applicable laws and regulations legal requirements frequently change and are subject to interpretation new laws regulations and changing interpretations by regulatory authorities together with uncertainty regarding adequate pollution control levels testing and sampling procedures new pollution control technology and cost benefit analysis based on market conditions are all factors that may increase our future expenditures to comply with environmental requirements the cost of complying with existing laws or regulations as currently interpreted or reinterpreted in the future or with future laws or regulations may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

our manufacturing and recycling operations produce significant amounts of byproducts some of which are handled as industrial waste or hazardous waste for example our mills generate electric arc furnace eaf dust which the united states environmental protection agency usepa and other regulatory authorities classify as hazardous waste eaf dust requires special handling recycling and disposal 

in addition the primary feed materials for the shredders operated by our metals recycling operations are automobile hulks and obsolete household appliances approximately 20 of the weight of an automobile hulk consists of unrecyclable material known as shredder fluff after the segregation of ferrous and saleable nonferrous metals shredder fluff remains we along with others in the recycling industry interpret federal regulations to require shredder fluff to meet certain criteria and pass a toxic leaching test to avoid classification as a hazardous waste we also endeavor to remove hazardous contaminants from the feed material prior to shredding as a result we believe the shredder fluff we generate is not normally considered or properly classified as hazardous waste however if laws or regulations the interpretation of the laws or regulations or testing methods change with regard to eaf dust or shredder fluff we may incur significant additional expenditures 

the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act cercla or superfund enables usepa and state agencies to recover from owners operators generators and transporters the cost of investigation and cleanup of sites which pose serious threats to the environment or public health in connection with cercla and analogous state laws we may be required to clean up contamination discovered at our sites including contamination that may have been caused by former owners or operators of the sites conduct additional cleanup at sites where we have already participated in remediation efforts or to take remediation action with regard to sites formerly used in connection with our operations 

in addition we may be required to pay for or to pay a portion of the costs of remediation at sites to which we sent hazardous wastes for disposal notwithstanding that the original disposal activity may have complied with all regulatory requirements then in effect pursuant to cercla a potentially responsible party can be held jointly and severally liable for all of the cleanup costs associated with a thirdparty disposal site in practice a liable party often splits the costs of cleanup with other potentially responsible parties we have received notices from usepa state agencies and third parties that it has been identified as potentially responsible for the cost of investigating and cleaning up a 

number of thirdparty disposal sites in most cases many other parties are also named as potentially responsible parties based upon information currently available to us we do not believe the potential cost in connection with the remediation of these sites will have a material effect on our business 

because cercla can be imposed retroactively on shipments that occurred many years ago and because usepa and state agencies are still discovering sites that pose a threat to public health or the environment we can provide no assurance that we will not become liable in the future for significant costs associated with investigation and remediation of additional cercla clean up sites 

cercla including the superfund recycling equity act of 1999 limits the exposure of scrap metal recyclers for sales of certain recyclable material under certain circumstances however the recycling defense is subject to the conducting of reasonable care evaluations of current and potential consuming facilities 

increased regulation associated with climate change and greenhouse gas emissions could impose significant additional costs on both our steelmaking and metals recycling operations 

the united states government or various governmental agencies may introduce regulatory changes in response to the potential impacts of climate change international treaties or agreements may also result in increasing regulation of greenhouse gas emissions including the introduction of carbon emissions trading mechanisms any such regulation regarding climate change and greenhouse gas or ghg emissions could impose significant costs on our steelmaking and metals recycling operations and on the operations of our customers and suppliers including increased energy capital equipment environmental monitoring and reporting and other costs in order to comply with current or future laws or regulations concerning and limitations imposed on our operations by virtue of climate change and ghg emissions laws and regulations the potential costs of allowances offsets or credits that may be part of potential capandtrade programs or similar future regulatory measures are still uncertain any adopted future climate change and ghg regulations could negatively impact our ability and that of our customers and suppliers to compete with companies situated in areas not subject to such limitations from a medium and longterm perspective we are likely to see an increase in costs relating to our assets that emit significant amounts of greenhouse gases as a result of these regulatory initiatives these regulatory initiatives will be either voluntary or mandatory and may impact our operations directly or through our suppliers or customers until the timing scope and extent of any future regulation becomes known we cannot predict the effect on our financial condition operating performance and ability to compete 

risks related to the business 

our senior secured credit agreement contains and any future financing agreements may contain restrictive covenants that may limit our flexibility 

restrictions and covenants in our existing debt agreements including our senior secured credit agreement and any future financing agreements may impair our ability to finance future operations or capital needs or to engage in other business activities specifically these agreements restrict our ability to 

• incur additional indebtedness • pay dividends or make distributions with respect to our capital stock • repurchase or redeem capital stock • make some investments • create liens and enter into sale and leaseback transactions • make some capital expenditures • enter into transactions with affiliates or related persons • issue or sell stock of certain subsidiaries • sell or transfer assets and • participate in some joint ventures acquisitions or mergers a breach of any of the restrictions or covenants could cause a default under our senior secured credit agreement our senior notes or our other debt a significant portion of our indebtedness then may become immediately due and payable if the default is not remedied 

under our senior secured revolving credit facility we are required to maintain certain financial covenants tied to our debt and profitability in addition we are subject to a monthly borrowing base requirement limiting the maximum availability of our senior secured revolver our ability to meet such ratios can be affected by events beyond our control if a default were to occur the lenders could elect to declare all amounts outstanding to be immediately due and payable and terminate all commitments to extend further credit if we are unable to repay those amounts the lenders could proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure such indebtedness we have pledged substantially all of our receivables and inventories and all shares of capital stock or other equity interests of the companys subsidiaries and intercompany debt held by us 

we may face significant price and other forms of competition from other steel producers and scrap processors which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operation or prospects 

the global markets in which steel companies and metals recyclers conduct business are highly competitive and have become even more so due in part to consolidations in recent years in the steel and the metal recycling industries and the recent global economic downturn increased competition could cause us to lose market share increase expenditures or reduce pricing any one of which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations or prospects 

we are subject to significant risks relating to changes in commodity prices and may not be able to effectively protect against these risks 

we are exposed to commodity price risk during periods where we hold title to scrap metal products that we may hold in inventory for processing or resale prices of commodities including 

recycled metals can be volatile due to numerous factors beyond our control in an increasing price environment for raw materials competitive conditions may limit our ability to pass on price increases to our consumers in a decreasing price environment for processed recycled metal we may not have the ability to fully recoup the cost of raw materials that we procure process and sell to our customers in addition new entrants into the market areas we serve could result in higher purchase prices for raw materials and lower margins from our recycled metal we are unable to hedge positions in certain commodities such as recycled ferrous metal where no established futures market exists or where we may from time to time hedge our positions in certain nonferrous metal transactions we could incur losses thus our sales and inventory position will be vulnerable to adverse changes in commodity prices which could materially adversely impact our operating and financial performance 

we may be unable to pass on increases in the cost of ferrous materials and other raw materials to our customers which would reduce our earnings 

if from time to time we are unable to pass on periodic increases in ferrous resource and other raw material costs to our customers we will be less profitable we may not be able to adjust our product prices especially in the shortterm to recover the costs of prolonged increases in raw material prices our principal raw material is scrap metal derived primarily from junked automobiles industrial scrap railroad cars railroad track materials agricultural machinery and demolition scrap from obsolete structures containers and machines the prices for scrap are subject to market forces largely beyond our control including demand by us and international steel producers freight costs and speculation the prices for scrap have varied significantly may vary significantly in the future and do not necessarily fluctuate in tandem with the price of steel moreover some of our integrated steel producer competitors are not as dependent as we are on scrap as a part of their raw material melt mix which during periods of high scrap costs relative to the cost of blast furnace iron used by the integrated producers give them a raw material cost advantage over minimills in addition our operations require substantial amounts of other raw materials including various types of pig iron alloys refractories graphite electrodes oxygen natural gas and electricity the price and availability of which are also subject to market conditions 

the profitability of our metals recycling operations depends in part on the availability of an adequate source of supply 

we procure our recyclable metal inventory from numerous sources these suppliers generally are not bound by longterm contracts and have no obligation to sell recyclable metal to us in periods of low industry prices suppliers may elect to hold recyclable metal to wait for higher prices or intentionally slow their metal collection activities if a substantial number of suppliers cease selling recyclable metal to us we will be unable to recycle metal at desired levels and our results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected in addition a slowdown of industrial production in the united states as has recently occurred reduces the supply of industrial grades of metal to the metal recycling industry resulting in our having less recyclable metal available to process and market 

we may face risks associated with the implementation of our growth strategy 

our growth strategy subjects us to various risks as part of our growth strategy we may expand existing facilities build additional plants acquire other businesses and steel assets enter into joint ventures or form strategic alliances that we believe will complement our existing business these transactions will likely involve some or all of the following risks 

• the difficulty of competing for acquisitions and other growth opportunities with companies having materially greater financial resources than ours 31 

• the inability to realize anticipated synergies or other benefits expected from an acquisition • the difficulty of integrating the acquired operations and personnel into our existing businesses • the potential disruption of ongoing businesses • the diversion of financial resources to acquired businesses • the diversion of management attention from other business concerns to acquired businesses • the loss of key employees and customers of acquired businesses • the potential exposure to unknown liabilities • the inability of management to maintain uniform standards controls procedures and policies • the difficulty of managing the growth of a larger company • the risk of entering markets in which we have little experience • the risk of becoming involved in labor commercial or regulatory disputes or litigation related to the new enterprise • the risk of becoming more highly leveraged • the risk of contractual or operational liability to other venture participants or to third parties as a result of our participation • the inability to work efficiently with joint venture or strategic alliance partners and • the difficulties of terminating joint ventures or strategic alliances these transactions might be required for us to remain competitive but we may not be able to complete any such transactions on favorable terms or obtain financing if necessary for such transactions on favorable terms future transactions may not improve our competitive position and business prospects as anticipated and if they do not our sales and earnings may be significantly reduced 

technology operating and startup risks as well as commodity market risks associated with our mesabi nugget ironmaking project may prevent us from realizing its anticipated benefits and could result in a loss of all or a part of our investment 

while we and certain of our current and former joint venture partners built and operated a successful small scale pilot plant on the mesabi iron range in minnesota for the production of a cost effective iron nugget using kobe steels proprietary itmk3® ironmaking process there are technology operational market and startup risks associated with the startup of our worlds first full scale commercial nugget plant utilizing this technology although we believe this full scale plant should be capable of consistently producing highquality iron nuggets for use as a scrap substitute feed stock in our steelmaking operations and in sufficient quantities and at a cost that will compare favorably with the cost of steel scrap and other more conventional scrap substitute products including pig iron there can be no assurance that these expectations will be achieved we have encountered and may from time to time encounter cost overruns systems or process difficulties or quality control problems or output restrictions as a result our capital costs could increase the expected cost benefits from the development of this iron nugget product could be diminished or lost and we could lose all or a substantial portion of our investment in the project we could also encounter commodity market risk if during a sustained period the cost to manufacture the nuggets is greater than projected or if the relative market price of scrap and other scrap substitutes for which this iron nugget product is intended as a lower cost substitute is lower than projected which could render our nuggets noneconomical moreover we are undertaking certain ancillary ventures related to the ironmaking 

process such as our nearby mesabi mining facility for which we are currently seeking operating permits to permit us to mine taconite ore for use in the production of nuggets mining is a business in which we have no previous experience and which is also subject to possible permitting and environmental risks and uncertainties 

we are subject to litigation which could adversely affect our profitability  

we are involved in various routine litigation matters including administrative proceedings regulatory proceedings governmental investigations environmental matters and commercial and construction contract disputes 

on september 17 2008 we and eight other steel manufacturing companies were served with a class action antitrust complaint filed in the united states district court for the northern district of illinois in chicago by standard iron works of scranton pennsylvania alleging violations of section 1 of the sherman act the complaint alleges that the defendants conspired to fix raise maintain and stabilize the price at which steel products were sold in the united states starting in 2005 by artificially restricting the supply of such steel products seven additional lawsuits each of them materially similar to the original have also been filed in the same federal court each of them likewise seeking similar class certification all but one of the complaints purport to be brought on behalf of a class consisting of all direct purchasers of steel products between january 1 2005 and the present the other complaint purports to be brought on behalf of a class consisting of all indirect purchasers of steel products within the same time period in addition on december 28 2010 we and the other codefendants were served with a substantially similar complaint in the circuit court of cocke county tennessee purporting to be on behalf of indirect purchasers of steel products in tennessee the case has been removed to federal court all complaints seek treble damages and costs including reasonable attorney fees pre and postjudgment interest and injunctive relief on january 2 2009 steel dynamics and the other defendants filed a joint motion to dismiss all of the direct purchaser lawsuits on june 12 2009 however the court denied the motion the parties are currently conducting discovery although we believe that the lawsuits are without merit and we are aggressively defending these actions we cannot presently predict the outcome of this litigation or make any judgment with respect to its potential exposure if any 

on october 25 2010 our whollyowned subsidiary omnisource corporation was indicted by a grand jury in marion county indiana on multiple criminal charges involving the alleged receipt or attempted receipt of stolen property we believe that these charges involving certain small dollar amount individual retail scrap metal purchase transactions are baseless and we are vigorously defending against these charges on december 30 2010 we filed a motion to dismiss this indictment on multiple grounds and on february 4 2011 this motion was argued and is currently under advisement 

in a related matter on october 18 2010 our indianapolis subsidiary filed a civil lawsuit against the prosecutor in marion superior court seeking return of cash seized by the police during that february 2009 raid in that lawsuit we claim that the police raid and subsequent proceedings constituted part of a meritless plan by the marion county prosecutor to extract money from omnisource under a threat of potential civil forfeiture of millions of dollars worth of omnisources property consistent with that characterization the prosecutor on december 30 2010 filed a counterclaim to the omnisource complaint seeking the civil forfeiture of all of omnisources indianapolis scrap facilities and certain other properties and facilities as well as the appointment of a receiver and other remedies on january 6 2011 we filed a motion to strike this counterclaim which was granted on january 31 2011 the prosecutor has filed a motion to be permitted to refile this counterclaim and that motion will be heard on march 3 2011 we believe that this counterclaim is without any factual or legal merit and if permitted to be refiled we will aggressively defend this action as well 

due to the uncertain nature of litigation we cannot predict the outcome of any of the foregoing lawsuits or proceedings an adverse result however could have a material adverse affect on our financial condition and profitability although we are unable at this time to make any dollar estimate of exposure to loss if any in connection with the foregoing matters and although we may make accruals if and as warranted any amounts that we may accrue from time to time could vary significantly from the amounts we actually pay due to inherent uncertainties and the inherent shortcomings of the estimation process the uncertainties involved in litigation and other factors 

unexpected equipment failures may lead to production curtailments or shutdowns  

interruptions in our production capabilities could adversely affect our production costs products available for sales and earnings during the affected period in addition to equipment failures our facilities are also subject to the risk of catastrophic loss due to unanticipated events such as fires explosions or violent weather conditions our manufacturing processes are dependent upon critical pieces of steelmaking equipment such as our furnaces continuous casters and rolling equipment as well as electrical equipment such as transformers this equipment may on occasion be out of service as a result of unanticipated failures we have experienced and may in the future experience material plant shutdowns or periods of reduced production as a result of such equipment failures 

some of our operations present significant risk of injury or death 

the industrial activities conducted at our facilities present significant risk of serious injury or death to our employees customers or other visitors to our operations notwithstanding our safety precautions including our material compliance with federal state and local employee health and safety regulations while we have in place policies and procedures to minimize such risks we may nevertheless be unable to avoid material liabilities for an injury or death even though we maintain workers compensation insurance to address the risk of incurring material liabilities for injury or death there can be no assurance that the insurance coverage will be adequate or will continue to be available on the terms acceptable to us or at all which could result in material liabilities for an injury or death 

governmental agencies may refuse to grant or renew some of our licenses and permits 

we must receive licenses permits and approvals from state and local governments to conduct certain of our operations such as our mesabi nugget and mesabi mining operations or to develop or acquire new facilities governmental agencies often resist the establishment of certain types of facilities in their communities including scrap metal collection and processing facilities and there may be environmental objections or concerns raised by governmental agencies or private citizens there can be no assurance that future approvals licenses and permits will be granted or that we will be able to maintain and renew the approvals licenses and permits we currently hold and failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

our common stock price may fluctuate substantially 

the market price of our common stock has experienced and may continue to experience significant volatility numerous factors including many over which we have no control may have a significant impact on the market price of our common stock these risks include those described or referred to in this risk factors section and in the other documents incorporated herein by reference as well as among other things 

• our actual or anticipated fluctuations in our operating and financial performance and prospects • perceptions regarding the level of our debt • investor perceptions relating to our products our industry and the markets in which we operate 34 

• market conditions in the end markets into which we or our customers sell our products • changes in industry forecasts earnings estimates or buysell recommendations by analysts and • broad financial domestic international economic and other market conditions in addition the stock market in recent years has experienced significant price and trading volume fluctuations that often have been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of individual companies these broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the price of our common stock regardless of our operating performance as a result of these factors among others the value of your investment may decline because a decrease in the market price of our common stock would likely adversely impact the trading price of the notes 

payment of dividends will depend on our future financial condition and performance 

while our board of directors has been authorizing the payment of regular quarterly cash dividends on shares of our common stock the timing and amount of future dividends will depend on the boards assessment of our operations financial condition projected cash needs contractual restrictions or restrictions imposed by applicable law and other factors we cannot guarantee that we will continue to declare dividends or declare them at the same or similar rates in addition our senior secured credit agreement and the indenture relating to our notes restrict the amount of cash dividends we can pay

operating statement classifications 

net sales net sales from our operations are a factor of volumes shipped product mix and related pricing we charge premium prices for certain grades of steel product dimensions valueadded processing or coating of steel and with regard to recycled metals for certain grades of scrap and larger quantities except for our steel fabrication operations segment we recognize revenue from sales and the allowance for estimated costs associated with returns from these sales at the time the title of the product is transferred to the customer provision is made for estimated product returns and customer claims based on estimates and actual historical experience revenues from steel fabrication operations are recognized from construction contracts utilizing a percentageofcompletion method which is based on the percentage of steel consumed to date as compared to the estimated total steel required for each contract 

costs of goods sold our costs of goods sold represent all direct and indirect costs associated with the manufacture of our products the principal elements of these costs for our steel operations are steel scrap and scrap substitutes which represent the most significant single component of our consolidated costs of goods sold alloys zinc natural gas argon direct and indirect labor and related benefits electricity oxygen electrodes depreciation materials and freight the principal elements of these costs for our metals recycling and ferrous resources operations are the costs of procuring the 

unprocessed scrap materials material transportation costs and processing expenses such as direct and indirect labor depreciation and utilities the principal elements of these costs for our steel fabrication operations include purchased steel and direct and indirect labor and related benefits 

selling general and administrative expenses selling general and administrative expenses consist of all costs associated with our sales finance and accounting and administrative departments these costs include among other items labor and related benefits professional services insurance premiums property taxes profit sharing and amortization of intangible assets 

interest expense net of capitalized interest interest expense consists of interest associated with our senior credit facilities and other debt described in the notes included herein to our financial statements net of interest costs that are required to be capitalized during the construction period of certain capital investment projects 

other income expense net other income consists of interest income earned on our temporary cash deposits and any other nonoperating income activity including gains on certain shortterm investments and income from nonconsolidated investments accounted for under the equity method other expense consists of any nonoperating costs 

overview 

we are one of the largest steel producers and one of the largest metals recyclers in the united states based on a current estimated annual steelmaking capability of 64 million tons and actual metals recycling shipping volumes during 2010 and 2009 of 52 million gross tons and 36 million gross tons of ferrous materials respectively and 961 million pounds and 780 million pounds of nonferrous metals respectively our steel production during 2010 and 2009 excluding the techs was 47 million tons and 35 million tons respectively during 2010 we reported net sales of 63 billion and an operating margin of 6 as compared to net sales of 40 billion and an operating margin of 3 during 2009 and net sales of 81 billion and an operating margin of 10 during 2008 

the primary sources of our revenues are from the manufacture and sale of steel products processing and sale of recycled ferrous and nonferrous metals and to a lesser degree fabrication and sale of steel joist and decking products our operations are managed and reported based on three operating segments steel operations metals recycling and ferrous resources operations and steel fabrication operations 

we achieved record revenues and operating income during 2008 with very strong demand and pricing in each of our operating segments resulting in strong margins and record operating results however beginning in the fourth quarter of 2008 and persisting throughout 2009 there were significant declines associated with the global economic slowdown impacting among other things nonresidential construction residential construction and automobile manufacturing activity which drove down both our volumes and sales prices thereby decreasing our total revenues while increasing our per unit cost to convert our raw materials to finished goods due to lower of cost or market inventory adjustments required in the first quarter of 2009 we experienced our lowest gross margin percentage results during that quarter with gross margins subsequently trending upward through the remainder of 2009 as the economic environment slowly improved and we continued to focus on cost reductions 

during 2010 we continued to experience improved net sales compared to 2009 driven by the general improvement of the domestic economy resulting in increasing customer demand and pricing for our products steel operations experienced overall improved customer order volume and pricing although there was some market volatility during the year the most impactful demand improvement in 2010 versus 2009 was in our sheet and special barquality steel products as the automotive transportation industrial and agricultural and construction equipment markets showed signs of recovery late in the fourth quarter we experienced increased order entry and pricing in our steel 

operations particularly in sheet products operating income in our steel operations for 2010 was up 2436 million or 124 compared with that of 2009 due to the improved volumes and pricing 

our metals recycling operations experienced improved shipping volumes and pricing of both ferrous and nonferrous metals in 2010 as demand improved due in large part to domestic and international steel production utilization rates increasing as compared to 2009 as a result of much stronger metals recycling operations as well as those of iron dynamics operating income in our metals recycling and ferrous resources operations increased 244 million to 197 million compared with 2009 the construction of the mesabi nugget facility was completed in 2009 and initial production of iron nuggets commenced january 2010 throughout 2010 we have been refining the production process and changing equipment configurations as needed in order to increase production and plant availability during 2010 mesabi nugget produced 75000 metric tons of ironnuggets for use by our own steel mills during 2011 we anticipate reaching much improved sustainable production levels moving towards the facilitys anticipated annual production capacity of 500000 metric tons the mesabi nugget startup operating losses excluding noncontrolling interests reduced consolidated pretax earnings by 42 million in 2010 versus 8 million in 2009 when the location was being constructed 

2011 outlook 

looking ahead to 2011 we are optimistic regarding slow but steady growth in the us economy which could result in increased volumes compared to 2010 for both our steel and metals recycling operations we expect steel consumption to grow in 2011 in the automotive transportation energy industrial and agricultural and construction equipment sectors we believe residential and nonresidential construction activity has likely reached its bottom the fruition of these combined factors should result in an improved operating environment for all our segments in the coming year 

our focus will continue to be on disciplined cost control revenue optimization and product growth opportunities while continuing to manage risk in an uncertain economic environment we currently plan to spend less than 200 million in capital investments during 2011 we believe our current operations and sources of cash are adequate to meet the cash requirements associated with these possible investments 

segment operating results 2010 vs 2009  dollars in thousands  



1 other consists of the results of subsidiary operations that are below the quantitative thresholds required for reportable segments as well as unallocated corporate accounts including profit sharing 



steel operations steel operations consist of our five electricarc furnace minimills producing steel from steel scrap utilizing continuous casting automated rolling mills and various downstream finishing facilities including the techs collectively our steel operations sell directly to end users and service centers these products are used in numerous industry sectors including the automotive construction commercial transportation and industrial machinery markets our steel operations accounted for 61 of our consolidated net sales and 4398 million of consolidated operating income 

in 2010 compared to 63 and 1962 million respectively in 2009 and 63 and 8430 million respectively in 2008 steel operations shipping volumes for the respective periods were as follows 



  sheet products our flat roll division sells a broad range of sheet steel products such as hot rolled cold rolled and coated steel products including a large variety of specialty products such as light gauge hot rolled galvanized galvalume® and painted products the techs operations comprised of three galvanizing lines also sells specialized galvanized sheet steels used in nonautomotive applications during 2010 our sheet operations represented 63 of our steel segments operating income as compared to 57 during 2009 and 45 during 2008 the increasing prominence of sheet steels as a percentage of our steel operations income is a reflection of the more prolonged depression of the long products market particularly within structural steel due to the continued weakness in nonresidential construction activity 

  long products our structural and rail division sells structural steel beams and pilings and a variety of standard and premiumgrade rail for the railroad industry our engineered bar products division primarily sells special bar quality and merchant bar quality rounds and roundcornered squares our roanoke bar division sells billets and merchant steel products including angles plain rounds flats and channels steel of west virginia primarily sells merchant beams channels and specialty structural steel sections 

net sales from our steel operations increased 14 billion or 53 during 2010 as compared to 2009 but were still 26 below the record sales achieved during 2008 net sales during 2010 were increased by both improved volumes and pricing steel segment shipments increased 12 million tons or 31 and average selling prices per ton shipped increased 112 during 2010 as compared to 2009 but also were still below record shipments of 55 million tons and average selling prices per ton shipped of 977 achieved during 2008 

as compared to the recessionary period of 2009 an improved 2010 us economic climate provided stronger demand for our steel products specifically within the automotive transportation industrial and agricultural and construction equipment markets which resulted in increased volumes and product pricing as an example automobile units produced in 2010 in the us increased 25 as compared to 2009 as noted in automotive news  as steel service center and other customer inventories 

remained relatively low during the year in comparison to historic levels any increase in enduser order activity directly impacted our own orders 

we saw stronger increases in demand related to our sheet products versus our long products in general during 2010 however within our long product operations special bar quality steel demand was especially strong and continues to remain so as agricultural and construction equipment markets continue to improve sheet product shipments increased 24 as average selling prices per ton shipped increased 126 while long product shipments increased 45 as average selling prices per ton shipped increased 80 

metallic raw materials used in our electric arc furnaces represent our most significant manufacturing cost our metallic raw material cost per ton consumed in our steel operations increased 107 during 2010 as compared to 2009 and decreased 83 as compared to the peakpricing that occurred during 2008 during 2010 2009 and 2008 our metallic raw material costs represented 62 52 and 63 respectively of our steel operations total manufacturing costs excluding the operations of the techs which purchases rather than produces the steel it further processes the lower relationship of scrap costs to total costs in 2009 is due to a decrease of 45 in the cost per ton of metallic raw materials consumed in 2009 versus 2008 while conversion and other costs held relatively steady 

gross margins increased 33 per ton during 2010 as compared to 2009 largely due to lower conversion and other costs per ton as increases in metallic raw materials were offset by improved product prices this increased gross margin per ton and the increase in volumes in 2010 versus 2009 resulted in improved steel segment operating income of 4398 million a 124 increase as compared to 2009 but a decrease of 48 from 2008 when product pricing increases outpaced the increases in metallic raw materials costs

metals recycling and ferrous resources operations this operating segment includes our metals recycling operations liquid pig iron manufacturing facility iron dynamics idi and iron nugget manufacturing facility mesabi nugget metals recycling and ferrous resources shipping volumes during the respective periods were as follows 



our metals recycling and ferrous resources operations accounted for 35 of our consolidated net sales in 2010 and 31 in both 2009 and 2008 net sales increased by 15 billion or 89 compared to 2009 which was 20 billion or 54 below 2008 sales levels this segment accounted for 197 million 47 million and 1048 million of our consolidated operating income loss during 2010 2009 and 2008 respectively during 2010 operating income during 2010 for the segment increased 244 million compared to 2009 due to increased margins and volumes in our metals recycling operations and idi which more than offset increased yearoveryear operating losses of 440 million including noncontrolling interest associated with our startup efforts at mesabi nugget during 2010 

  metals recycling our metals recycling operations omnisource represent our metals sourcing and processing operations and are the most significant source of income in this segment these operations sell ferrous metals to steel mills and foundries and nonferrous metals such as copper brass aluminum and stainless steel to ingot manufacturers copper refineries and mills smelters and specialty mills our metals recycling operations represented 96 of this segments net sales in both 2010 and 2009 and 97 in 2008 and 657 million 169 million and 851 million of operating income during 2010 2009 and 2008 respectively with the increase in profitability in 2010 coming from both increased volume and pricing for both ferrous and nonferrous products 

during 2010 our metals recycling operations recorded shipments of 52 million gross tons of ferrous metals and 961 million pounds of nonferrous materials compared with 36 million gross tons and 780 million pounds during 2009 and 50 million gross tons and 912 million pounds during 2008 during 2010 and 2009 our metals recycling operations provided approximately 47 of the steel scrap purchased by our steel mills compared to 41 in 2008 sales of recycled metals to our 

own mills represented 27 23 and 31 of omnisources net sales for 2010 2009 and 2008 respectively the increased volume and pricing of our ferrous materials is directly impacted by the increase in both domestic steel mill utilization and global steel mill production since the steel industry is our primary customer domestic steel mill utilization increased from 51 for full year 2009 to 70 for full year 2010 per american iron and steel institute  and global steel mill production increased 15 for full year 2010 over full year 2009 per world steel association  

  ferrous resources our ferrous resource operations consist of the revenues and expenses associated with our liquid pig iron facility idi our ironnugget manufacturing facility mesabi nugget and our potential future mining operations mesabi mining idi primarily produces liquid pig iron which is used as a scrap substitute raw material input exclusively at our flat roll division the construction of the mesabi nugget facility was completed in 2009 and initial production of iron nuggets commenced january 2010 throughout 2010 we have been refining the production process and changing equipment configurations as needed in order to increase production and plant availability during 2010 mesabi nugget produced 75000 metric tons of ironnuggets for use by our own steel mills during 2011 we anticipate reaching much improved sustainable production levels moving towards the facilitys anticipated annual production capacity of 500000 metric tons 



our steel fabrication operations include six operating and two idled new millennium building systems plants located in the midwest southeastern and southwestern parts of the united states revenues from these plants are generated from the fabrication of trusses girders steel joists and steel decking used within the nonresidential construction industry steel fabrication operations accounted for 3 4 and 5 of our consolidated net sales with operating losses of 251 million and 64 million during 2010 and 2009 respectively and operating income of 179 million during 2008 net sales for the segment increased 194 million or 12 in 2010 compared to 2009 as volumes increased in 2010 by 13 compared to 2009 but are still well below 2008 volumes average pricing decreased just slightly overall in 2010 compared with 2009 and decreased by 232 compared to 2008 the operating loss in 2010 includes a noncash impairment charge of 128 million related to our idled south carolina facility after the purchase of additional fabrication assets in the fourth quarter of 2010 and determining the future use of existing fabrication facilities we determined that the carrying value of certain fixed assets at our idled south carolina fabrication facility exceeded their fair value as determined utilizing market and cost approaches 

the purchase of various steel products is the largest single cost of production for our steel fabrication operations during 2010 2009 and 2008 the cost of steel products purchased represented 70 70 and 79 respectively of the total cost of manufacturing for our steel fabrication operations the cost of steel increased in 2010 as compared to 2009 by 18 per ton this increase coupled with a 1 decrease in average selling values resulted in decreased gross margins during 2010 compared to 2009 

in spite of the recovering economy in 2010 nonresidential construction remained very weak and did not meaningfully improve from 2009 however we believe the industry segment has hit its bottom we are seeing some encouraging signs emerging for our steel fabrication segment as we have continued to experience slightly positive trends in order entry activity and product pricing and we anticipate the nonresidential construction recovery to develop at a slow pace during 2011 the october purchase of joist assets from another manufacturer in arkansas nevada and northern mexico for 176 million gives us a broader geographic presence in the joist market moving forward providing us the opportunity to better serve our customers that have a nationwide footprint and gain further market share

consolidated results 2010 vs 2009 

selling general and administrative expenses sga selling general and administrative expenses including profit sharing and amortization of intangible assets were 2981 million during 2010 as compared to 2795 million during 2009 an increase of 186 million or 7 our sga expenses represented 5 of our total net sales during 2010 compared to 7 during 2009 the decrease directly related to the decrease in the ratio of our fixed to variable sga costs as net sales increased 

we recorded expense of 211 million or 9 of consolidated pretax earnings without noncontrolling interests during 2010 and 22 million during 2009 related to our steel dynamics performancebased profit sharing plan allocation the plans contribution percentage consists of 2 of consolidated pretax earnings plus a unique percentage of each of our profitable operating segments pretax earnings during 2010 and 2009 we recorded additional profit sharing expense of 44 million and 732000 respectively related to certain subsidiaries whose employees did not participate in the aforementioned plan 

amortization of intangible assets decreased 80 million or 15 during 2010 compared to 2009 amortization expense in 2009 included 62 million of additional amortization due to the finalization of finitelived intangible asset valuations related to the acquisition of recycle south 

impairment charges after the purchase of additional fabrication assets in the fourth quarter of 2010 and determining the future use of existing fabrication facilities we determined that the carrying value of certain fixed assets at our idled south carolina fabrication facility exceeded their fair value as determined utilizing market and cost approaches the resulting impairment charge of 128 million was recorded with the steel fabrication reporting segment 

interest expense net of capitalized interest during 2010 gross interest expense increased 149 million to 1772 million and capitalized interest decreased 139 million to 70 million when compared to 2009 the interest capitalization that occurred during these periods resulted from the interest required to be capitalized with respect to construction activities at our various operating segments the decrease in capitalized interest was due to the completion of construction at our mesabi nugget facility during the fourth quarter of 2009 we currently anticipate gross interest expense in 2011 to be relatively flat in comparison to 2010 

other income net other expense other income net other expense was 189 million during 2010 as compared to 36 million during 2009 we earned interest income of 41 million during 2010 versus 14 million in 2009 during 2009 the company terminated an interest rate swap contract and recorded other expense of 13 million 

income taxes during 2010 our income tax expense was 839 million as compared to income tax benefit of 72 million during 2009 our effective income tax rate before noncontrolling interests was 393 and 396 during 2010 and 2009 respectively 

included in the 494 million balance of unrecognized tax benefits at december 31 2010 are potential benefits of 197 million that if recognized would affect the effective tax rate at december 31 2010 the company had 111 million accrued for the payment of interest and penalties the company recognized 12 million of interest and penalties related to its tax contingencies on a netoftax basis in 2010 income tax expense 

we file income tax returns in the us federal jurisdiction as well as income tax returns in various state jurisdictions the internal revenue service irs is currently examining our federal income tax returns for the years 2004 through 2009 at this time we do not expect to have any significant examination adjustments that would result in a material change to our financial position or results of operations the state of indiana completed its examination of the calendar years 2000 through 2005 in the third quarter of 2008 the total tax paid to settle the examinations was 207 million which was included in the balance of unrecognized tax benefits recorded at that time it is reasonably possible that the amount of unrecognized tax benefits could change in the next twelve months as a result of state and federal income tax audits based on the current audits in process the payment of taxes as a result of audit settlements could be in an amount from zero to 28 million by the end of 2011 with few exceptions we are no longer subject to federal state and local income tax examinations by tax authorities for years ended before 2007 

consolidated results 2009 vs 2008 

net loss was 82 million or 004 per diluted share during 2009 compared with net income of 4634 million or 238 per diluted share in 2008 net sales in 2009 decreased 41 billion or 51 to 40 billion as compared to the record sales of 81 billion achieved during 2008 and our 2009 gross margin percentage was 10 as compared to 15 during 2008 most notably beginning in the fourth quarter of 2008 and persisting throughout 2009 our realized gross margins were significantly lower than historical results driven by the economic recession which drove down both our sales prices and volumes thereby decreasing our total revenues while increasing our cost to convert our raw materials to finished goods per unit we experienced our lowest gross margin percentage results during the first quarter of 2009 as we recorded a noncash negative inventory valuation adjustment of 833 million pertaining primarily to the rapid decline in sheet product pricing gross margins subsequently trended upward through the remainder of 2009 

selling general and administrative expenses sga selling general and administrative expenses including profit sharing and amortization of intangible assets were 2795 million in 2009 as compared to 3849 million in 2008 a decrease of 1054 million or 27 our sga expenses represented 7 of our total net sales during 2009 compared to 5 during 2008 the increase directly related to the increase in the ratio of our fixed to variable sga costs as net sales decreased 

we recorded expense of 22 million in 2009 and 617 million or 8 of consolidated pretax earnings without noncontrolling interests in 2008 related to our steel dynamics performancebased profit sharing plan allocation the plans contribution percentage consists of 2 of consolidated pretax earnings plus a unique percentage of each of our profitable operating segments pretax earnings our steel operations segment earned a profit sharing contribution during 2009 in spite of our consolidated pretax loss during the year due to that segments individual profitability during 2009 and 2008 we 

recorded additional profit sharing expense of 732000 and 53 million respectively related to certain subsidiaries whose employees did not participate in the aforementioned plan 

amortization of intangible assets increased 122 million or 30 during 2009 compared to 2008 the 2009 increase includes 62 million of additional amortization due to the finalization of finitelived intangible asset valuations related to the acquisition of recycle south 

interest expense net capitalized interest during 2009 gross interest expense decreased 117000 to 1623 million and capitalized interest increased 31 million to 209 million when compared to 2008 the interest capitalization that occurred during these periods resulted from the interest required to be capitalized with respect to construction activities at our various operating segments 

other income net other expense other income net other expense was 36 million during 2009 as compared to 331 million during 2008 during 2008 other income of 202 million was attributable to earnings from investments in metals recycling entities which were accounted for under the equity method of accounting recycle souths results which contributed 204 million of other income as an equitybased investment during 2008 were not included in other income during 2009 rather as a whollyowned subsidiary after our june 2008 acquisition recycle souths results were required to be consolidated in our financial statements in addition we realized gains on sales of marketable securities of 86 million in 2008 

income taxes our 2009 income tax benefit was 72 million as compared to income tax expense of 2804 million during 2008 our effective income tax rate before noncontrolling interests was 396 and 382 in 2009 and 2008 respectively 

liquidity and capital resources 

our business is capital intensive and requires substantial expenditures for the purchase and maintenance of equipment used in our operations and to remain in compliance with environmental laws our shortterm and longterm liquidity needs arise primarily from capital expenditures working capital requirements and principal and interest payments related to our outstanding indebtedness we have met these liquidity requirements with cash provided by operations issuances of common stock longterm borrowings and state and local grants 

operational working capital during 2010 our operational working capital position representing our cash invested in trade receivables inventories and income taxes receivable less current liabilities other than debt increased 2321 million to 12 billion compared to december 31 2009 trade receivables increased 1956 million or 46 during 2010 to 6222 million of which more than 98 were current or less than 60 days past due our largest customer is an affiliated company heidtman steel which represented 5 and 6 of our outstanding trade receivables at december 31 2010 and 2009 respectively trade receivables increased during 2010 due to increased shipping volumes and product prices total inventories increased 2612 million or 31 to 11 billion during 2010 our raw materials primarily steel scrap inventories increased by approximately 1841 million during 2010 with scrap volumes increasing by 97000 gross tons or 14 likewise our workinprocess and finished goods inventories increased 647 million with volumes increasing by 31000 tons or 8 our trade payables and general accruals increased 1250 million or 29 during 2010 this is a reflection of our increased production activity and commodity raw material purchasing during 2010 as well as the increase of 207 million in our profit sharing accrual compared with 2009 income taxes receivable net related payable decreased 993 million due to the receipt of 1020 million in federal tax refunds in 2010 

capital investments during 2010 we invested 1334 million in property plant and equipment of which 517 million related to our steel operations 223 million related to metals recycling operations and 230 million related to equipment modifications at mesabi nugget we believe these capital investments will benefit our revenue streams and related cash flows as each project reaches completion and attains appropriate operational metrics we estimate capital expenditures for the year 2011 to be less than 200 million 

capital resources and longterm debt during 2010 our total outstanding debt increased 1641 million to 24 billion due to our issuance of 3500 million of 7 5  8  senior notes due 2020 in march 2010 the net proceeds were used to repay the then outstanding borrowings on our senior secured revolving credit facility with remaining net proceeds used for general corporate purposes our total longterm debt to capitalization ratio representing our longterm debt including current maturities divided by the sum of our longterm debt redeemable noncontrolling interest and total equity was 528 at december 31 2010 and 526 at december 31 2009 at december 31 2010 there were no outstanding borrowings under our senior secured revolving credit facility 

the companys 9240 million senior secured revolving credit facility due june 2012 is secured by substantially all of the companys and its whollyowned subsidiaries receivables and inventories and by pledges of all shares of the companys whollyowned subsidiaries capital stock and is subject to a borrowing base at the end of each month the companys revolver must be the lesser of 9240 million less other applicable commitments such as letters of credit and other secured debt as defined within the credit agreement these additional commitments were 150 million at december 31 2010 or the sum of 85 of the companys eligible accounts receivable and 65 of the companys eligible inventories less other applicable commitments such as letters of credit and other secured debt as defined within the credit agreement at december 31 2010 the company had 9090 million of availability on its senior secured revolver 

our senior secured credit agreement contains financial covenants and other covenants that limit or restrict our ability to make capital expenditures incur indebtedness permit liens on property enter into transactions with affiliates make restricted payments or investments enter into mergers acquisitions or consolidations conduct asset sales pay dividends or distributions and enter into other specified transactions and activities our ability to borrow funds within the terms of the revolver is dependent upon our continued compliance with our financial covenants and other covenants contained in the senior secured credit agreement 

the financial covenants state that we must maintain an interest coverage ratio of not less than 250 to 100 from december 31 2010 through maturity our interest coverage ratio is calculated by dividing our lasttwelve trailing months ltm consolidated adjusted ebitda earnings before interest taxes depreciation amortization and certain other noncash transactions as allowed in our senior secured credit agreement by our ltm gross interest expense we must maintain a first lien debt to ltm ebitda ratio of not more than 300 to 100 from december 31 2010 through maturity beginning with the twelve month period ended december 31 2010 and at all times thereafter a total debt to consolidated ltm adjusted ebitda ratio of not more than 500 to 100 must be maintained in addition if the total debt to ebitda ratio exceeds 350 to100 at any time then the ability of the company to make restricted payments as defined in the credit agreement which includes cash dividends to stockholders and share purchases among other things is limited to 250 million per quarter 

at december 31 2010 our interest coverage first lien debt and total debt ratios were 379 to 100 003 to 100 and 374 to 100 respectively we were in compliance with these covenants at december 31 2010 and we expect to remain in compliance during 2011 

cash dividends we declared cash dividends of 651 million or 30 per share during 2010 667 million or 325 per share during 2009 and 752 million or 40 per share during 2008 we paid cash dividends of 650 million 687 million and 713 million during 2010 2009 and 2008 respectively our board of directors along with executive management approves the payment of dividends on a quarterly basis the determination to pay cash dividends in the future will be at the discretion of our board of directors after taking into account various factors including our financial condition results of operations outstanding indebtedness and current and anticipated cash needs and growth plans 

other our ability to meet our debt service obligations and reduce our total debt will depend upon our future performance which in turn will depend upon general economic financial and business conditions along with competition legislation and regulatory factors that are largely beyond our control in addition we cannot assure you that our operating results cash flow access to credit markets and capital resources will be sufficient for repayment of our indebtedness in the future we believe that based upon current levels of operations and anticipated growth cash flow from operations together with other available sources of funds including additional borrowings under our senior secured credit agreement will be adequate for the next twelve months for making required payments of principal and interest on our indebtedness funding working capital requirements and anticipated capital expenditures 

during 2010 we received benefits from state and local governments in the form of real estate and personal property tax abatements and credits of approximately 57 million based on our current abatements and incentive credits and utilizing our existing longlived asset structure we estimate the remaining annual benefit to our future operations to be approximately 50 million 39 million 25 million 19 million 15 million 425000 and 293000 during the years 2011 through 2017 respectively and 215000 thereafter 

contractual obligations and other longterm liabilities 

we have the following minimum commitments under contractual obligations including purchase obligations as defined by the us securities and exchange commission a purchase obligation is defined as an agreement to purchase goods or services that is enforceable and legally binding and that specifies all significant terms including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased fixed minimum or variable price provisions and the approximate timing of the transaction other longterm liabilities are defined as longterm liabilities that are reflected on our balance sheet under generally accepted accounting principles based on this definition the following table includes only those contracts which include fixed or minimum obligations it does not include normal purchases which are made in the ordinary course of business the following table provides aggregated information about outstanding contractual obligations and other longterm liabilities as of december 31 2010 in thousands 



1 the longterm debt payment information presented above assumes that our senior notes and convertible notes remain outstanding until maturity refer to note 2 to the consolidated financial statements elsewhere in this report for additional information regarding our longterm debt 2 the estimated interest payments shown above assume interest rates of 7 3  8  on our 700 million senior unsecured notes due october 2012 5125 on our 2875 million convertible senior notes due june 2014 6 3  4  on our 500 million senior unsecured notes due april 2015 7 3  4  on our 500 million senior unsecured notes due april 2016 7 5  8  on our 350 million senior unsecured notes due march 2020 050 commitment fee on our available senior secured revolver and an average of 52 on our other debt of 493 million 3 purchase obligations include commitments we have for the purchase of electricity fuel natural gas and its transportation and zinc these arrangements have take or pay or other similar 

commitment provisions we have utilized such take or pay requirements during the past three years under these contracts 

4 construction commitments relate to firm contracts we have with various vendors for the completion of certain construction projects at our various divisions at december 31 2010 5 other commitments principally relate to certain pension and deferred compensation plan obligations 6 we expect to make cash outlays in the future related to our unrecognized tax benefits however due to the uncertainty of the timing we are unable to make reasonably reliable estimates regarding the period of cash settlement with the respective taxing authorities accordingly unrecognized tax benefits and related interest and penalties of 605 million as of december 31 2010 have been excluded from the contractual obligations table above refer to note 3 to the consolidated financial statements elsewhere in this report for additional information 

other matters 

inflation 

we believe that inflation has not had a material effect on our results of operations 

environmental and other contingencies 

we have incurred and in the future will continue to incur capital expenditures and operating expenses for matters relating to environmental control remediation monitoring and compliance during 2010 we incurred costs related to the monitoring and compliance of environmental matters in the amount of approximately 310 million and capital expenditures related to environmental compliance of approximately 18 million over 78 of the costs incurred during 2010 for monitoring and compliance were related to the normal transportation of certain types of waste produced in the steelmaking process in accordance with legal requirements we incurred combined environmental remediation costs of approximately 688000 at all of our facilities during 2010 we have an accrual of 20 million net of 15 million of escrowed funds recorded as a contingency for environmental remediation related to our metals recycling operations and 29 million related to mesabi nugget and mesabi mining we believe apart from our dependence on environmental construction and operating permits for our existing and proposed manufacturing facilities that compliance with current environmental laws and regulations is not likely to have a materially adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or liquidity however environmental laws and regulations have changed rapidly in recent years and we may become subject to more stringent environmental laws and regulations in the future such as the impact of united states government or various governmental agencies introducing regulatory changes in response to the potential of climate change 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

managements discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states we review the accounting policies we use in reporting our financial results on a regular basis the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities we evaluate the appropriateness of these estimations and judgments on an ongoing basis we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources results may differ from these estimates due to actual outcomes being different from those on which we based our assumptions we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 

revenue recognition and allowance for doubtful accounts except for our steel fabrication operations segment we recognize revenues from sales and the allowance for estimated costs associated with returns from these sales when the title of the product transfers upon shipment provision is made for estimated product returns and customer claims based on estimates and actual historical experience if the historical data used in our estimates does not reflect future returns and claims trends additional provision may be necessary our steel fabrication operations segment recognizes revenues from construction contracts using a percentage of completion methodology based on steel tons used on completed units to date as a percentage of estimated total steel tons required by each contract steel fabrication operations accounted for 3 4 and 5 of our net sales in 2010 2009 and 2008 respectively 

we are exposed to credit risk in the event of nonpayment by our customers which in steel operations are principally intermediate steel processors and service centers that sell our products to numerous industry sectors including the automotive construction commercial transportation and industrial machinery markets our metals recycling operations sell ferrous metals to steel mills and foundries and nonferrous metals such as copper brass aluminum and stainless steel to among others ingot manufacturers copper refineries and mills smelters and specialty mills we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments based on known credit risks historical loss experience and current economic conditions affecting our customers we mitigate our exposure to credit risk by performing ongoing credit evaluations and taking further action when necessary such as requiring letters of credit or other security interests to support the receivable from our customer if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate resulting in the impairment of their ability to make payments additional allowance may be required 

inventories we record inventories at lower of cost or market cost is determined principally on a firstin firstout basis 

impairments of longlived tangible and finitelived intangible assets we review longlived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable impairment losses are recorded on longlived assets used in operations when indicators of impairment are present and the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than the assets carrying amounts the impairment loss is measured by comparing the fair value of the asset to its carrying amount we consider various factors and determine whether an impairment test is necessary including by way of examples a significant and prolonged deterioration in operating results and projected cash flows significant changes in the extent or manner in which an asset is used technological advances with respect to assets which would potentially render them obsolete our strategy and capital planning and the economic climate in markets to be served 

after the purchase of additional fabrications assets in the fourth quarter of 2010 and determining the future use of existing fabrication facilities the company determined that the carrying value of certain fixed assets at its idled south carolina fabrication facility exceeded their fair value as determined by utilizing market and cost approaches the resulting impairment charge of 128 million was recorded within the steel fabrications reporting segment 

goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets our goodwill relates to various business combinations and is allocated to the following reporting units at december 31in thousands 



at least once annually or when indicators of impairment exist we perform an impairment test for goodwill goodwill is allocated to various reporting units which are generally one level below our operating segments we utilize a twostepped approach to measuring goodwill impairment the first step of the test determines if there is potential goodwill impairment in this step we compare the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying amount which includes goodwill the fair value of the reporting unit is determined by using an estimate of future cash flows utilizing a riskadjusted discount rate to calculate the net present value of future cash flows and assessing its reasonableness by using a market approach based upon an analysis of valuation metrics of comparable peer companies if the carrying amount exceeds the fair value we perform the second step of the test which measures the amount of impairment loss to be recorded if any in the second step we compare the carrying amount of the goodwill to the implied fair value of the goodwill based on the net fair value of the recognized and unrecognized assets and liabilities of the reporting unit if the implied fair value is less than the carrying value an impairment loss is recorded to the extent that the fair value of the goodwill is less than its carrying value 

key assumptions used to determine the estimated fair value of each reporting unit under the discounted cash flows method include a expected cash flows for the fiveyear period following the testing date including market share sales volumes and prices costs to produce and estimated capital needs b an estimated terminal value using a terminal year growth rate determined based on the growth prospects of the reporting unit and c a discount rate based on managements best estimate of the aftertax weighted average cost of capital management considers historical and anticipated future results general economic and market conditions the impact of planned business and operational strategies and all available information at the time the fair values of its reporting units are estimated 

goodwill and other intangible assets acquired in recent transactions are naturally more susceptible to impairment primarily due to the fact that they are recorded at fair value based on recent operating plans and economic conditions present at the time of acquisition consequently if operating results andor economic conditions deteriorate shortly after an acquisition it could result in the impairment of the acquired assets a deterioration of economic conditions may not only negatively impact the estimated operating cash flows used in our cash flow models but may also negatively impact other assumptions used in our analyses including but not limited to the estimated cost of capital andor discount rates additionally we are required to ensure that assumptions used to determine fair value in our analyses are consistent with the assumptions a hypothetical marketplace participant would use as a result the cost of capital andor discount rates used in our analyses may increase or decrease based on market conditions and trends regardless of whether our actual cost of capital has changed therefore we may recognize an impairment of an intangible asset or assets in spite of realizing actual cash flows that are approximately equal to or greater than our previously forecasted amounts 

our other indefinitelived intangible assets relate to trademarks acquired through various business combinations and is allocated to the following reporting units at december 31 2010 and 2009 in thousands 



at least annually or when indicators of impairment exist we perform an impairment test for indefinitelived intangible assets through the comparison of the fair value of the specific intangible asset with its carrying amount the fair value of the intangible asset is determined by using an estimate of future cash flows attributable to the asset and a riskadjusted discount rate to compute a net present value of future cash flows if the fair value is less than the carrying value an impairment loss is recorded in an amount equal to the excess in carrying value 

as of our most recent annual impairment reviews which occurred during the fourth quarter of 2010 we had no significant impairments of goodwill or indefinitelived intangible assets individually or in the aggregate in addition as of december 31 2010 we did not have any reporting units with a material amount of goodwill for which it is reasonably likely that they will fail step one of a goodwill impairment test in the near term however if economic conditions or our outlook affecting these reporting units change significantly it is possible that we may experience impairments of some of our goodwill or indefinitelived intangible assets which would require us to recognize impairment charges 

income taxes we are required to estimate our income taxes as a part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements this requires us to estimate our actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatments of items for tax and accounting purposes these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities which are included within our consolidated balance sheet we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely we must establish a valuation allowance we establish reserves to reduce some or all of the tax benefit of any of our tax positions at the time we determine that the positions become uncertain we adjust these reserves including any impact on the related interest and penalties in light of changing facts and circumstances such as the progress of a tax audit a number of years may elapse before a particular matter for which we have established a reserve is audited and finally resolved the number of years with open tax audits varies depending on the tax jurisdiction the tax benefit that has been previously reserved because of a failure to meet the more likely than not recognition threshold would be recognized in our income tax expense in the first interim period when the uncertainty disappears settlement of any particular issue would usually require the use of cash 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

market risk 

in the normal course of business we are exposed to interest rate changes our objectives in managing exposure to interest rate changes are to limit the impact of these rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower overall borrowing costs to achieve these objectives we primarily use interest rate swaps to manage net exposure to interest rate changes related to our portfolio of borrowings 

the following table represents the principal cash repayments and related weightedaverage interest rates by maturity date for our longterm debt as of december 31 2010 in thousands 



commodity risk 

in the normal course of business we are exposed to the market risk and price fluctuations related to the sale of our products and to the purchase of raw materials used in our operations such as metallic raw materials electricity natural gas and zinc our risk strategy associated with product sales has generally been to obtain competitive prices for our products and to allow operating results to reflect market price movements dictated by supply and demand 

our risk strategy associated with the purchase of raw materials utilized within our operations has generally been to make some commitments with suppliers relating to future expected requirements for some commodities such as fuel zinc electricity and natural gas and its transportation certain commitments contain provisions which require us to take or pay for specified quantities without regard to actual usage for periods of up to 24 months for physical commodity requirements and for up to 10 years for commodity transportation requirements our commitments for these arrangements with take or pay or other similar commitment provisions for the years ending december 31 are as follows in thousands 



we utilized such take or pay requirements during the past three years under these contracts we believe that production requirements will be such that consumption of the products or services purchased under these commitments will occur in the normal production process we also purchase electricity consumed at our flat roll division pursuant to a contract which extends through december 2012 the contract designates 160 hours annually as interruptible service and establishes an agreed fixedrate energy charge per millkwh consumed for each year through the expiration of the agreement 

in our metals recycling operations we have certain fixed price contracts with various customers and suppliers for future delivery of nonferrous metals our risk strategy has been to enter into base metal financial contracts with the goal to protect the profit margin within certain parameters that was contemplated when we entered into the transaction with the customer at december 31 2010 we had a cumulative unrealized loss associated with these financial contracts of 50 million all of which have a settlement date in 2011 we expect the customer contracts associated with the financial contracts to be fully consummated

 item 1 business 

our company 

we are one of the largest steel producers and one of the largest metals recyclers in the united states based on a current estimated annual steelmaking capability of 63 million tons and actual metals recycling shipping volumes during 2008 and 2009 of 56 million tons and 41 million tons of ferrous materials respectively and 912 million pounds and 780 million pounds of nonferrous metallics respectively our steel production excluding the techs during 2008 and 2009 was 48 million tons and 35 million tons respectively in 2008 we reported net sales of 81 billion and an operating margin of 10 as compared to net sales of 40 billion and an operating margin of 3 during 2009 at december 31 2009 we employed approximately 5990 individuals 90 of which are nonunion located at our operations throughout the eastern half of the united states 

steel dynamics inc was incorporated in indiana in august 1993 our principal executive offices are located at 7575 w jefferson blvd fort wayne indiana 46804 and our telephone number is 2609693500 

the primary sources of our revenues are from the manufacture and sale of steel products processing and sale of recycled ferrous and nonferrous metals and to a lesser degree fabrication and sale of steel joist and decking products our operations are managed and reported based on three operating segments steel operations metals recycling and ferrous resources operations and steel fabrication operations 

steel operations steel operations consist of our five electricarc furnace minimills producing steel from steel scrap utilizing continuous casting automated rolling mills and various downstream finishing facilities including the techs operations our steel operations accounted for 81 of our consolidated net sales in 2007 and 63 in both 2008 and 2009 collectively our steel operations sell directly to end users and service centers these products are used in numerous industry sectors including the automotive construction commercial transportation and industrial machinery markets 

  sheet products our flat roll division sells a broad range of sheet steel products such as hot rolled cold rolled and coated steel products including a large variety of specialty products such as light gauge hot rolled galvanized galvalume® and painted products the techs operations comprised of three galvanizing lines acquired in july 2007 also sells specialized galvanized sheet steels used in nonautomotive applications in 2008 our sheet operations represented only 45 of our steel segments pretax income as compared to 65 in 2009 the greater proportion of our pretax income was derived from sheet products in 2009 as compared to 2008 representing the more severe decline in long product demand more specifically in structural steels used predominantly in the nonresidential construction markets 

  long products our structural and rail division sells structural steel beams and pilings and is also designed to produce and sell a variety of standard and premiumgrade rail for the railroad industry our engineered bar products division primarily sells special bar quality and merchant bar quality rounds and roundcornered squares our roanoke bar division sells billets and merchant steel products including angles plain rounds flats and channels steel of west virginia primarily sells merchant beams channels and specialty structural steel sections 

metals recycling and ferrous resources operations this operating segment includes our metals recycling operations liquid pig iron manufacturing facility and iron nugget manufacturing startup facility our metals recycling and ferrous resources operations accounted for 9 of our consolidated net sales in 2007 and 31 in both 2008 and 2009 

  metals recycling our metals recycling operations represent our metals sourcing and processing operations and are the most significant source of income in this segment as evidenced by the increased diversification of our revenue streams beginning in 2008 we have significantly grown our metals recycling business through the acquisition of omnisource corporation in october 2007 and recycle south llc in june 2008 our metals recycling operations sell ferrous metals to steel mills and foundries and nonferrous metals such as copper brass aluminum and stainless steel to among others ingot manufacturers copper refineries and mills smelters and specialty mills in 2008 and 2009 31 and 23 respectively of the sales from metals recycling were to our own steel operations in 2008 our metals recycling operations represented 92 of this segments gross margin as compared to 108 in 2009 

  ferrous resources our ferrous resource operations consist of the revenues and expenses associated with our scrap substitute manufacturing facility iron dynamics idi and mesabi nugget and mesabi mining idi primarily produces liquid pig iron which is used as a scrap substitute raw material input exclusively at our flat roll division mesabi nugget began initial limited production of iron nuggets in january 2010 we believe substantially all of the iron nuggets produced by mesabi nugget will be used in our steel operations again as a raw material substitute for primarily imported pig iron but possibly also as a substitute for steel scrap 

steel fabrication operations our steel fabrication operations include three operating and two idled new millennium building systems plants located in the midwest and southeastern parts of the united states revenues from these plants are generated from the fabrication of trusses girders steel joists and steel decking used within the nonresidential construction industry steel fabrication operations accounted for 5 and 4 of our consolidated net sales and 4 of our consolidated gross margin during 2008 and 2009 respectively 

current environment 

as a result of prevailing domestic and global economic conditions in the second half of 2008 and throughout 2009 there has been significant declines in among others nonresidential construction residential construction and automobile manufacturing activity consistently 2009 was a challenging year for our company and the domestic steel manufacturing and metals recycling industries specifically as a result of this environment we have experienced deterioration in the volumes of orders and prices we can charge our customers in these industries and as a consequence our revenues and profitability have also declined 

despite these challenges we believe we are wellpositioned to weather this economic downturn our financial strategy currently includes a commitment to improve our leverage metrics while allowing for longterm sustainable growth and maintaining appropriate liquidity levels our commitment to these goals drives a focus on controlling costs and maximizing per unit margins managing capital investments and disciplined growth 

during 2009 our focus was toward strengthening our capital structure and enhancing longterm liquidity 

• in june we executed joint common stock and senior convertible note issues raising net proceeds of approximately 6788 million and prepaying all of our term a loan of 5520 million • we concurrently amended the covenants within our senior secured credit agreement to gain greater flexibility from 2009 through the end of 2010 • during a very challenging year we were able to decrease overall debt by 4276 million improve our liquidity position by 1938 million—all while • investing 3739 million in capital growth projects • funding 617 million in 2008 employee profit sharing contributions and • paying 687 million in cash dividends to our stockholders • additionally our total debt to equity capitalization ratio decreased from 62 to 53 and our first lien leverage as defined in the notes to our financial statements contained herein was 49x at december 31 2009 competitive strengths  business strategy 

although the depth and duration of the current economic downturn has been more pronounced than previous recessions we believe our financial strategy coupled with our competitive advantages of maintaining a low variable cost structure producing a diversified valueadded product offering controlling a secure supply of recycled ferrous metals and having an experienced senior management team and entitywide entrepreneurial culture has positioned us to navigate the economic downturn in a manner that can strengthen our leadership position in a recovery and improve our returns to stockholders 

one of the lowest cost steel producers in the united states stateoftheart facilities  continue to maintain low production costs 

we are focused on continuing to maintain and enhance one of the lowest operating cost structures in the north american steel industry our low operating costs are primarily a result of our efficient plant designs and operations our high productivity rate such as our productivity rate of approximately 03 man hours per hot band ton produced at our flat roll divisions mill low ongoing maintenance cost requirements and strategic locations near sources of our primary raw material scrap steel and our customers 

we will continue to strive to optimize the use of our equipment enhance our productivity and explore new technologies to further improve our unit costs of production at each of our facilities we believe that as one of the lowest cost producers in each of our primary operating segments we are able to better manage through cyclical and noncyclical such as the current economic environment downturns and to always maximize our profitability we continuously seek to maximize the variability of our cost structure and to reduce per unit and fixed costs our incentive compensation plans at all employee levels are based on both divisional and consolidated company performance they are designed to reward high productivity and efficient use of physical resources and capital employed 

experienced management team and unique corporate culture  foster entrepreneurial culture 

our senior management team is highly experienced and has a proven track record in the steel industry and metals recycling industry their objectives are closely aligned with our stockholders through meaningful stock ownership positions and performancebased compensation programs our corporate culture is also unique for the steel industry we emphasize decentralized decision making and have established incentive compensation programs specifically designed to reward employee teams for their efforts towards enhancing productivity improving profitability and controlling costs 

we intend to continue to foster our entrepreneurial corporate culture and emphasize decentralized decision making and responsibility while rewarding teamwork innovation and operating efficiency we will also continue to focus on maintaining the effectiveness of our incentivebased bonus plans that are designed to enhance overall productivity and align the interests of our management and employees with our stockholders 

diversified product mix  expand product offerings 

our current products in our steel segment include hot rolled cold rolled galvanized galvalume® and painted sheet steel various structural steel beams and rails special bar quality steel various merchant steel products including beams angles flats and channels in addition we offer steel finishing and fabrication services in the metals recycling segment our products include an array of both ferrous and nonferrous scrap processing scrap management transportation and brokerage products and services finally our steel fabrication segment produces steel joists and steel decking materials this diversified mix of products enables us to access a broad range of enduser markets serve a broad customer base and mitigate our exposure to cyclical downturns in any one product or enduser market in addition our value added product offerings help to balance our exposure to commodity grade products 

we will continue to seek additional opportunities to further expand our range of products through the expansion of existing facilities greenfield projects and acquisitions of other steel producers or steelmaking assets as well as scrap recycling companies that may become available in both the domestic steel and recycling industries completion of our mesabi nugget project as well as the expansions and upgrades of existing facilities are important steps in pursuing our strategy of product line expansion 

secure supply of ferrous raw materials  develop metals recycling and ferrous resources business platform 

we maintain a secure supply of ferrous raw material resources through the benefit of our metals recycling operations omnisource corporation as well as through our current and future ironmaking facilities iron dynamics and mesabi nugget ferrous materials represent our singlelargest manufacturing cost and generally represent between 55 and 60 of our steel production costs during 2009 omnisource provided our steel operations with 47 of their ferrous material needs and iron dynamics provided our flat roll division with 7 of the mills iron requirements through the transfer of liquid pig iron a higherquality energysaving substitute as mesabi nugget production increases it will also supply our steel operations with iron requirements 

as global and domestic demand for steel products improves as a response to improving world economies and consumption rates we believe there will be pressure on the supply of world commodities including ferrous materials during this economic downturn there has been a significant reduction in industrial scrap supply due to historically low manufacturing rates there has also been less generation of other sources of scrap such as auto bodies appliances and other goods as consumers are utilizing assets for longer periods of time and replacing items less frequently in addition as world demand increases domestic ferrous resources are often shipped overseas to developing countries for their own consumption in steel production 

we believe our metals recycling and ferrous resources operations not only provide us with a quality cost effective secure raw material platform but we also believe they provide us with significant revenue generating and profitability opportunities that allow for funding of future growth whether in resources or in other ventures we intend to continue to participate in the development of new technologies to increase the effectiveness of our metals recycling recovering capabilities and to develop new relationships in order to increase the amount of unprocessed metals we have the ability to source and eventually sell 

strategic geographic locations  enter new geographic markets 

the locations of our steelmaking facilities near sources of scrap materials and near our customer base allow us to realize freight savings for inbound scrap as well as for outbound steel products destined for our customers recycled steel scrap and iron units represent the most significant component of our cost of steel manufacturing our metals recycling facilities are located in the upper midwest and southeastern united states and thus further expand our geographic service area we believe these regions account for a majority of the total steel scrap produced in the united states the techs in pittsburgh pennsylvania and our jeffersonville indiana galvanizing facility located on the ohio river also provide us with a geographic reach to southern markets 

we may seek to enter new steel markets in strategic geographic locations that offer attractive growth opportunities 

2010 outlook 

looking ahead to 2010 we remain cautious concerning demand for our products given the current economic environment however we are seeing positive signs as our order logs related to sheet steel products special barquality products and ferrous and nonferrous materials are improving we currently anticipate increased utilization rates in both our steel and metals recycling operations during the year given the continued weakness in the nonresidential construction markets we currently do not anticipate material improvement during 2010 in our fabrication or structural steels operations 

our focus will continue to be on enhanced liquidity disciplined cost control and revenue optimization while continuing to manage risk in an uncertain and volatile economic environment we currently plan to spend less than 150 million in capital investments during 2010 of which over 50 

are currently within our steel operations we believe our current possible sources of cash are adequate to meet the cash requirements associated with these possible investments as we progress through the year if our markets and liquidity levels warrant we may approve additional capital investments or delay already planned projects 

industry segments 

we have three reportable segments steel operations metals recycling and ferrous resources operations and steel fabrication operations please refer to item 7 consolidated financial statements and supplementary data for additional information 



our steel operations segment consists of steelmaking and coating operations the following chart summarizes the locations and the capacities of the facilities in the broad categories 



  



1 the increase in future expected casting capacity is due to the anticipated completion of a second caster in the third quarter of 2010 we expect to begin commissioning 2 the increase in expected future casting and rolling capacity is due to anticipated expansion of melting capacity 3 excess billet tonnage available for sale 

note capacities represent the capabilities based on mill configuration and the related employee support these capacities do not represent expected volumes in a given year in addition estimates of 

mill capacity particularly rolling capacity are highly dependent on the specific product mix manufactured each of our mills can and do roll many different types and sizes of products therefore our capacity estimates assume a typical product mix 

sheet products 

our steel sheet products are produced by both our flat roll division which consists of our flat roll mill galvanizing and paint facilities in butler indiana our galvanizing and paint facilities in jeffersonville indiana and the techs our pittsburgh pennsylvaniabased galvanizing company which operates three galvanizing facilities galvtech metaltech and nextech 

our flat roll mill manufactures flat rolled hot rolled cold rolled and coated steel products we produced 24 million tons and 22 million tons at this facility in 2008 and 2009 respectively our products are characterized by high quality surface characteristics precise tolerances and light gauge in addition this mill has achieved iso 90012008—ansiisoasq q90012008 certification we believe that these certifications have enabled us to serve a broad range of customers who may require certifications for themselves or to satisfy the endusers of our steel products 

our flat roll mill has two twinshell electric arc furnaces which enable us to melt scrap in one vessel while tapping the other vessel and refilling it with steel scrap and iron units to make it ready for the next heat this results in more heats and greater productivity we have three ladle metallurgy stations two continuous thinslab casters which produce twoinch slabs and two tunnel furnaces our hot rolling mill which progressively reduces the slab in thickness consists of a sevenstand rolling mill capable of rolling sheet steel down to 10mm with excellent surface quality which enables us to access markets previously available only to more costly cold finished material 

located within our flat roll mill we have a hot rolled galvanizing line capable of coating steel in gauges from 044 to 160 inches and in widths ranging from 39 to 61 inches also within our flat roll mill we have a cold rolled galvanizing line capable of coating steel in gauges from 014 to 068 inches and in widths ranging from 39 to 61 inches our onsite paint line receives material directly from our other processing lines and is capable of painting hot rolled galvanized coil cold rolled coil and cold rolled galvanized coil in gauges of 010 to 070 inches and in widths ranging from 39 to 61 inches we believe this enables us to realize substantial savings in the production of painted coil when compared to remote offsite coating facilities 

in jeffersonville indiana we have a cold rolled galvanizing facility located within the clark maritime centre on the ohio river this facility is capable of coating cold rolled steel in gauges from 008 to 045 inches and in widths between 24 and 60 inches this gauge range is lighter than that available from our butler facility and creates further expansion of our value added product offerings our flat roll mill provides our jeffersonville facility with cold rolled material 

the techs facilities produced 804000 tons and 640000 tons at this facility in 2008 and 2009 respectively the techs facilities have galvanizing lines with varying capabilities nextech is capable of coating cold rolled steel in gauges from 007 to 020 inches and in widths between 24 and 43 inches galvtech is capable of coating cold rolled steel in gauges from 012 to 040 inches and in widths between 30 and 60 inches metaltech is capable of coating cold rolled steel in gauges from 015 to 160 inches and in widths between 24 and 52 inches in addition to third party steel producers our flat roll division provides the techs with required steel material the techs has achieved the iso 90012000—ansiisoasq q90012000 certification 

the following table summarizes the mix of types of sheet products we sold during the respective years 



hot rolled products our flat roll mill produces hot rolled products that include a variety of high quality mild and medium carbon and high strength low alloy hot rolled bands in widths from 40 inches to 62 inches and in thicknesses from 500 inches down to 043 inches we also produce an array of lighter gauge hot rolled products including high strength low alloy and medium carbon steels these products are suitable for automobile suspension arms frames wheels and other unexposed parts in auto and truck bodies truck trailer and recreational vehicle parts and components mechanical and structural steel tubing gas and fluid transmission piping building and construction products rail cars ships barges and other marine equipment agricultural equipment and farm implements lawn garden and recreation equipment industrial machinery and shipping containers and highway guard rails we believe that our basic hot rolled material has shape characteristics that exceed those of other thinslab flat roll steel minimills and compares favorably with those of the integrated steel mills 

we sell a portion of our hot rolled coils produced at our flat roll mill directly to endusers or to intermediate steel processors or service centers where they may be pickled cold rolled annealed tempered galvanized or painted by those customers the rest of the hot rolled coils are directed to our cold mill where we add value to this product through our own pickling cold rolling annealing tempering galvanizing and painting processes a portion of our cold rolled production is shipped to our jeffersonville indiana galvanizing facility 

cold rolled products cold rolled steel is hot rolled steel that has been further processed through a pickler and then passed through a rolling mill until the desired gauge or thickness and other physical properties have been achieved cold rolling reduces gauge and hardens the steel and when further processed through an annealing furnace and a temper mill improves uniformity ductility and formability cold rolling can also impart various surface finishes and textures cold rolled steel is used in exposed steel applications that demand higher surface quality or finish such as exposed automobile and appliance panels as a result of higher processing costs cold rolled prices are typically higher than hot rolled prices cold rolled material is often coated or painted 

coated products hot rolled or cold rolled steel can be coated with zinc to render it corrosionresistant and to improve its paintability galvanized galvannealed galvalume® electrogalvanized and aluminized products are types of coated steels these are also the highest valueadded sheet products because they require the greatest degree of processing and tend to have the strictest quality requirements coated steel is used in high volume applications such as automobiles household appliances roofing and siding heating and air conditioning equipment air ducts switch boxes chimney flues awnings garbage cans and food containers our paint lines in butler and jeffersonville incorporate stateoftheart coil coating equipment with quick color change capability and online color matching this allows us to produce prepainted steel products that are used in many of these same end products 

we also produce hot rolled pickled and oiled hot rolled galvanized hot rolled galvannealed cold rolled galvanized cold rolled galvannealed and fully processed cold rolled sheet as a result of our lighter gauge hot rolling capabilities our hot rolled galvanized and galvannealed steel products are capable of replacing products that have traditionally only been available as more costly cold rolled galvanized or cold rolled galvannealed steel this material is typically used in transportation products building products such as raised garage door panels heating and cooling products appliances furniture and lighting equipment 

customers steel processors and service centers typically act as intermediaries between primary steel producers and the many enduser manufacturers that require further processing of hot rolled coils the additional processing performed by the intermediate steel processors and service centers include pickling galvanizing cutting to length slitting to size leveling blanking shape correcting edge rolling shearing and stamping we expect that our intermediate steel processor and service center customers will remain an integral part of our customer base the location of our jeffersonville facility on the ohio river also creates opportunities for market expansion into other geographic regions our flat roll divisions sales inside the united states accounted for approximately 99 of the divisions sales in 2009 

during 2009 we sold our flat rolled products to approximately 400 customers heidtman steel products inc which is principally owned by one of our directors accounted for approximately 4 and 3 of our consolidated net sales in 2008 and 2009 respectively 

the techs produces galvanized flat rolled products that are similar to those produced by our flat roll division and sold to a similar customer base each of the techs facilities specializes in the galvanizing of specific types of flat rolled steels in generally nonautomotive applications servicing a variety of customers in the heating ventilation and air conditioning hvac commercial construction and consumer goods markets the techs sales inside the united states were approximately 98 in 2009 

the following table summarizes the types of customers who purchased our sheet products 



markets flat rolled products represent the largest portion of the domestic steel market flat rolled products consist of hot rolled cold rolled and coated steel the following table shows the us shipments of these products as reported by the american iron and steel institute aisi 



1 includes pipetube sheet strip and plate in coils 2 includes blackplate sheet strip and electrical 3 includes tin coated hot dipped galvanized electrogalvanized and all other metallic coated 

competitors our flat roll divisions products compete with many north american integrated hot rolled coil producers such as us steels plants near detroit michigan granite city illinois gary indiana dravosburg pennsylvania and fairfield alabama ak steel corporations plant in middletown ohio and mittal steels facilities in east chicago illinois riverdale illinois cleveland ohio indiana harbor indiana burns harbor indiana and sparrows point maryland our hot rolled products also compete with the products of a number of hot rolled minimills such as nucor corporations plants in crawfordsville indiana hickman arkansas decatur alabama and berkeley south carolina gallatin steel companys plant in ghent kentucky and north star bluescope steels plant in delta ohio our flat rolled products compete as well with companies that convert steel slabs into sheet steel such as duferco steel in farrell pennsylvania

we produced 11 million tons and 500000 tons at this facility during 2008 and 2009 respectively our facility melts scrap and iron units in two singleshell electric arc furnaces our existing continuous caster is capable of casting four strands of various sized blooms and beam blanks in varying lengths of 17 to 48 feet we can transport the cast strands directly through a reheat furnace to our original fourstand all reversing hot rolling mill to our medium section rolling mill completed in 2008 or into a storage area for reheating and rolling in either mill at a later time our original hot rolling mill rolls the product into either a structural steel product or a rail product the medium section rolling mill can 

produce lighter structural shapes and merchant bar our columbia city indiana facility has achieved the iso 90012000—ansiisoasq q90012000 certification 

products we have the capability to produce various structural steel products such as wide flange beams american standard beams miscellaneous beams h piling material american standard and miscellaneous channels bulb angles and zees the following listing shows structural steel products and their intended markets 



we have also initiated certain value added services for the midwestern fabricator market including exact length and exact piece count capabilities 

customers the principal customers for our structural steel products are steel service centers steel fabricators and various manufacturers service centers though not the ultimate enduser provide valuable mill distribution functions to the fabricators and manufacturers including small quantity sales repackaging cutting preliminary processing and warehousing the majority of our structural steel products are sold to service centers our structural and rail divisions sales inside the united states accounted for approximately 92 of the divisions sales in 2009 

sales of structural steel products are sensitive to the level of construction activity including infrastructure development which is in turn affected by such cyclical factors as general economic conditions interest rates inflation consumer and government spending and employment 

markets according to the steel manufacturers association domestic structural steel consumption in 2007 2008 and 2009 was approximately 84 million tons 76 million tons and 43 million tons respectively consumption of structural steel products is influenced both by new construction and manufacturing activity and by the selection of steel over alternative structural or manufacturing materials 

competitors our structural steel products compete with various electric arc furnace structural steelmakers some of which have cost structures and flexible management cultures similar to our own notable competitors include nucor steel in berkeley south carolina nucoryamato steel in blytheville arkansas gerdau ameristeel in midlothian texas and petersburg virginia and arcelor mittal in laplace louisiana the nucor minimills and the gerdau ameristeel minimills have accounted for the majority of tons produced in north america over the past three years we also believe however that both geography and product choice play significant roles there are currently no other structural mills located in the midwest one of the largest structural steel consuming regions in the united states and we believe we provide freightsavings and customer service benefits to service centers fabricators and manufacturers located in the region we also believe that most of canadas structural steel consumption is located in canadas eastern provinces closer to us than to either of our two largest competitors moreover we provide a broad product mix focusing on the midrange and 

larger section served only by nucoryamato steel and gerdau ameristeel from locations more remote than our facility

metals recycling 

our metals recycling operations include both ferrous and nonferrous scrap metal processing transportation marketing brokerage and consulting services in over 70 locations primarily in the midwest and southeast portion of the united states in addition omnisource designs installs and manages customized scrap management programs for industrial manufacturing companies at more than 200 locations throughout north america our steel mills utilize a portion of the steel scrap processed through omnisource as raw material in our steelmaking operations and the remainder is sold to other consumers such as other steel companies and foundries in 2009 omnisource supplied our steel mills with approximately 47 of their ferrous raw material requirements representing approximately 23 of omnisources 2009 net sales 

our metals recycling operations processed andor brokered approximately 56 million tons and 41 million tons of ferrous material during 2008 and 2009 respectively omnisource also processed and 

brokered approximately 912 million pounds and 780 million pounds of nonferrous material during 2008 and 2009 respectively omnisources revenues by major scrap category in 2009 were approximately 56 ferrous and 44 nonferrous including stainless sales inside the united states accounted for approximately 94 of omnisources net sales in 2009 

we sell various grades of ferrous scrap metals to steel mills and foundries and we sell various grades of nonferrous metals such as copper brass aluminum and stainless steel we generally sell these materials to aluminum sheet and ingot manufacturers brass and bronze ingot makers copper refineries and mills smelters specialty mills alloy manufacturers and other consumers ferrous scrap metal is the primary raw material for electric arc furnaces such as those operated by our steel mills our mills do not utilize the nonferrous scrap we purchase ferrous and nonferrous scrap metals processed and unprocessed in a variety of forms for our metals recycling facilities 

ferrous scrap comes from two primary sources i manufacturers and industrial plants metal fabrication plants machine shops and factories which generate steel scrap referred to as prompt or industrial scrap and ii scrap dealers retail individuals auto wreckers demolition firms and others who generate steel and iron scrap referred to as obsolete scrap market demand and the composition quality size weight and location of the materials are the primary factors that determine prices we purchase nonferrous scrap from three primary sources i manufacturers and other nonferrous scrap sources which generate or sell scrap aluminum copper stainless steel and other nonferrous metals ii producers of electricity telecommunication service providers aerospace defense and recycling companies that generate nonferrous scrap consisting primarily of copper wire aluminum beverage cans and various other metals and alloys and iii retail individuals who deliver directly to our facilities material which they collect from a variety of sources we also collect ferrous and nonferrous scrap from sources other than those that are delivered directly to our processing facilities by placing retrieval boxes near these sources the boxes are subsequently transported to our processing facilities 

our metals recycling facilities consist of offices warehouse buildings and open air collection and processing facilities of various sizes and acreages equipped with specialized equipment for processing both ferrous and nonferrous metal we receive sort process and store the metals we equip our facilities with scales shears baling presses briquetting machines conveyors and magnetic separators which enable us to efficiently process large volumes of scrap metals to facilitate processing shipping and receiving we equip our ferrous metal processing centers with presses shredders or hydraulic shears to prepare and compress scrap metal for easier handling cranes are utilized to handle scrap metals for processing and to load material for shipment many facilities have rail access as ferrous scrap is primarily shipped by open gondola railcar additionally several of the metals recycling divisions have achieved certifications including iso 90012000 iso 90012008 and iso 140012004 certification 

products our metals recycling operations primarily involve the purchase processing and resale of ferrous and nonferrous scrap metals into reusable forms and grades 

we produce an array of ferrous products used in foundry and steel mill applications for use in our own steel mills or for resale to other customers through a variety of methods including sorting shearing cutting torching baling shredding briquetting and breaking our major ferrous products include heavy melting steel busheling bundled scrap shredded scrap and other scrap metal products such as steel turnings and cast iron these products vary in properties or attributes related to cleanness size of individual pieces and residual alloys these factors are determined by the specific needs and requirements of the consumer and affect the individual products relative value we process nonferrous products including aluminum brass copper stainless steel and other nonferrous metals for use in foundry mill refining and smelting applications our superior aluminum alloys operations produce specification aluminum alloys in the form of ingots sows and molten metal in addition we provide transportation logistics truck rail and river barge management services marketing brokerage and consulting services related to the scrap industry 

customers we sell processed ferrous scrap to endusers such as steel producing minimills like ours integrated steelmakers foundries secondary smelters and metal brokers who aggregate materials for other large users most of our ferrousscrap customers purchase processed scrap through negotiated spot sales contracts which establish a quantity purchase for the month the price we charge for ferrous scrap depends upon market demand and transportation costs as well as the quality and grade of the scrap in many cases our selling price also includes the cost of transportation to the enduser 

we sell processed nonferrous scrap to endusers such as specialty steelmakers foundries aluminum sheet and ingot manufacturers copper refineries and smelters brass and bronze ingot manufacturers wire and cable producers utilities and telephone networks 

markets according to the institute of scrap recycling industries isri approximately 85 million tonnes of recycled iron and steel are processed annually in the united states scrap is a global commodity influenced by conditions in a number of industrialized countries throughout asia europe and north america isri estimates that approximately 18 million tonnes of ferrous scrap were exported from the us in 2008 market pricing of scrap was characterized in 2009 by high volatility 

scrap metal supplies are generated from a variety of sources industrial scrap or home scrap is generated from steel processing and manufacturing facilities utilizing steel in their production process obsolete scrap including post consumer waste demolition of steel structures and automobiles represent a significant source of scrap generation we do not purchase a material amount of scrap metal from a single source or from a limited number of major sources 

competitors the markets for scrap metals are highly competitive both in the purchase of raw scrap and the sale of processed scrap with regard to the purchase of raw scrap we compete with numerous independent recyclers as well as smaller scrap companies engaged only in collecting industrial scrap in many cases we also purchase unprocessed scrap metal from smaller scrap dealers and other processors successful procurement of materials is determined primarily by the price offered by the purchaser for the raw scrap and the proximity of our processing facility to the source of the raw scrap both ferrous and nonferrous scrap sells as a commodity in both national and international markets which are affected by relative economic conditions currency fluctuations and the availability and cost of transportation competition for sales of processed scrap is based primarily on the price quality and location of the scrap metals as well as the level of service provided in terms of reliability and timing of delivery 

we also face potential competition for sales of processed scrap from other producers of steel products such as integrated steel mills and steel minimills some of which are vertically integrated in the scrap metals recycling business as a number of steel manufacturers currently operate their own scrap yards in addition other steel mills may compete with us in attempting to secure scrap supply through direct purchasing from our scrap suppliers scrap metals processors also face competition from substitutes for prepared ferrous scrap such as prereduced iron pellets hot briquetted iron pig iron iron carbide and other forms of processed iron the availability and relative prices of substitutes for ferrous scrap could result in a decreased demand for processed ferrous scrap and could result in lower prices andor lower demand for our scrap products 

the industry is highly fragmented with many smaller family owned companies although omnisource also competes with a number of national and global companies each of which has multiple locations in areas in which omnisource also operates these include the david j joseph company a subsidiary of nucor corporation sims metal management ferrous processing and trading co aleris international cmc a division of commercial metals company newell recycling and darlington shredding in addition omnisource competes with many regional scrap companies no single scrap metals recycler has a significant market share in the domestic market 

ferrous resources 

sources availability and cost of steel raw materials 

scrap metals our principal raw material of our steel operations segment is scrap metal derived from among other sources home scrap generated internally at steel mills themselves industrial scrap generated as a byproduct of manufacturing and obsolete scrap recycled from endoflife automobiles appliances railroad cars and railroad track materials agricultural machinery and demolition scrap from obsolete structures containers and machines 

scrap typically comprises more than 80 of the metallic melt mix in electric arc furnace steelmaking in contrast to integrated mill steelmaking where the proportion of scrap has traditionally been approximately 25 to 35 depending upon the scrap substitute material that may be available from time to time and the relative cost of such material the percentage of scrap used in our steelmaking operations could be reduced down to almost 60 of our metallic melt mix 

many variables can impact scrap prices all of which reflect the pushes and pulls of the supply demand equation these factors include the level of us new steel production for high quality low residual scrap is a byproduct of new steel manufacturing activity the level of exports of scrap from the united states the amount of obsolete scrap production and the effect of speculation on the amount of scrap offered on the market from time to time generally as domestic steel demand increases so does scrap demand and resulting scrap prices the reverse is also normally but not always true with scrap prices following steel prices downward when supply exceeds demand according to isri scrap recyclers in the us annually recycle approximately 85 million tonnes of ferrous scrap and approximately 11 million tonnes of nonferrous scrap 

the following table provides pricing per gross ton from metal based trade associations estimates for ferrous materials used in steel production 

the price of steel scrap as a commodity has tended to be volatile rising and falling with supply and demand and not always in lock step with or in proportion to the market price of new steel when scrap costs greatly accelerate this threatens one of the principal elements of a minimills traditional 

lower cost structure—the cost of its metallic raw material therefore having a lower cost alternative source of iron for a portion of a minimills melt mix if realizable would partially buffer the effects of high scrap prices and scrap price volatility with the growing proportion of electric furnace steelmaking both worldwide and domestically we believe that the benefit of developing a costeffective alternate iron source to augment scrap our primary raw material makes good economic sense in the long run 

iron units direct reduced iron hot briquetted iron and pig iron can substitute for a limited portion of the steel scrap used in electric furnace minimill steel production during 2009 we consumed 41 million tons of metallic materials in our steel making furnaces and approximately 8 by weight was scrap substitutes mainly liquid pig iron our iron dynamics operations supplied 223000 tons of scrap substitutes 

iron dynamics 

iron dynamics developed a process of producing liquid pig iron and hot briquetted iron hbi that serves as a substitute for a portion of the metallic raw material mix that goes into our electric arc furnaces to produce steel direct reduced iron dri is a metallic product made from millscale and iron ore fines that has been reduced in a rotary hearth furnace using natural gas and coal the reduction method employed by iron dynamics uses coal as the reducing agent the dri is either compacted by briquetters to form hbi or is processed further to produce liquid pig iron hbi can be immediately used in our melting furnaces or stockpiled for later use liquid pig iron is tapped from iron dynamics submerged arc furnace and immediately transferred in ladles to the flat roll mills melt shop where it is combined with scrap steel in the mills electric arc furnaces during 2009 approximately 85 of dri production was used to produce liquid pig iron 

since the plants initial startup in august 1999 we have made continuous process design and equipment modifications to improve production capacity and uptime capabilities we have encountered various quality and consistency issues with this pioneering technology during 2009 the plants primary focus was to maximize liquid pig iron production due to the inherent economic benefits achieved when the material is used in the steelmaking process such as reduced energy cost reduced materials cost and quicker melting cycles during 2009 iron dynamics produced 165000 tonnes 148000 tonnes in 2008 of liquid pig iron and 37000 tonnes 68000 tonnes in 2008 of hbi we have used and plan to use all of the facilitys output in our steelmaking operations 

mesabi nugget and mesabi mining 

mesabi nugget our ironmaking project at hoyt lakes minnesota began the commissioning process of the facility in the fourth quarter of 2009 and by the end of december all individual production systems were operational and prepared for integration nuggets were produced on january 12 2010 the facility continues to test and refine the process during its initials startup phase this plant is the worlds first commercial ironmaking facility to use the itmk3® process an ironnugget production technology pioneered by kobe steel ltd which kobe steel is licensing to the venture we hold an equity position of 850 million or an 81 equity interest while kobe steel holds an equity position of 200 million or 19 noncontrolling equity interest the project involved the construction of an ironnugget manufacturing facility utilizing ironore concentrate coal and natural gas annual ironnugget production capacity is expected to be 500000 tonnes we anticipate that substantially all of the iron output from the planned nugget plant will be consumed in our mills we believe that this new business will be capable of providing a cost effective source of iron units to our steel mills that is of equal or higher quality than purchased pig iron 

we also plan to reopen an existing iron mine on the mesabi iron range and to construct a facility for concentrating iron ore we have purchased land on the mesabi iron range in minnesota that is expected to provide a longterm supply of iron ore in the future we plan to process the iron ore and use it as raw material feedstock for the nugget plant in total the cost of the mining project is currently estimated to be approximately 167 million mesabi mining is currently in the permitting process and mining operations could begin as early as the end of 2011 however this is dependent on receiving the appropriate permits which are expected at the end of 2010 



our fabrication operations primarily serve the nonresidential construction industry as a result of the prevailing domestic decline in this industry as well as many other constructionrelated industries it is estimated that the steel joist and decking domestic demand decreased almost 50 during 2009 as a result we have been unable to maintain our volumes and prices therefore our revenues and profitability have been severally reduced at these operations in an effort to reduce costs and losses during this unprecedented downturn in the nonresidential construction markets we idled our south carolina facility in the fourth quarter of 2008 and our ohio facility in the second quarter of 2009 during 2008 these idled operations negatively impacted the segments operating income by 5 or an operating loss of 945000 we have an annual estimated joist production capacity of 210000 tons and an estimated deck production capacity of 170000 tons in the currently operating facilities 

we fabricate trusses girders steel joists and steel decking these products are sold to the nonresidential building components market total production of all products was 287000 tons and 145000 tons during 2008 and 2009 respectively our flat roll division and roanoke bar division supply a substantial portion of the steel utilized in these manufacturing operations

environmental matters 

our steel operations metals recycling and ferrous resources operations and steel fabrication operations are subject to substantial and evolving local state and federal environmental health and safety laws and regulations concerning among other things emissions to the air discharges to surface and ground water and to sewer systems and the generation handling storage transportation treatment and disposal of toxic and hazardous substances in particular our steel manufacturing operations are dependent upon both state and federal permits regulating discharges into the air or into the water in order to operate our facilities we believe that in all current respects our steel operations metals recycling and ferrous resources operations and steel fabrication operations are in material compliance with all provisions of federal and state laws concerning the environment and we do not 

currently believe that future compliance with such provisions will have a material adverse effect on our results of operations cash flows or financial condition 

since the level of enforcement of environmental laws and regulations or the nature of those laws that may be enacted from time to time are sometimes subject to changing social or political pressures our environmental capital expenditures and costs for environmental compliance may increase in the future in addition due to the possibility of unanticipated regulatory or other developments the amount and timing of future environmental expenditures may vary substantially from those currently anticipated the cost of current and future environmental compliance may also place us steel producers at a competitive disadvantage with respect to foreign steel producers which may not be required to undertake equivalent costs in their operations 

pursuant to the resource conservation and recovery act or rcra which governs the treatment handling and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes the united states environmental protection agency or us epa and authorized state environmental agencies conduct inspections of rcra regulated facilities to identify areas where there may have been releases of solid or hazardous constituents into the environment and require the facilities to take corrective action to remediate any such releases rcra also allows citizens to bring certain suits against regulated facilities for potential damages and clean up our steelmaking facilities are subject to rcra our manufacturing operations produce various byproducts some of which for example electric arc furnace or eaf dust are categorized as industrial or hazardous waste requiring special handling for disposal or for the recovery of metallics we collect such coproducts in approved baghouses and other facilities but we are also examining alternative reclamation technologies to recycle some of these products while we cannot predict the future actions of the regulators or other interested parties the potential exists for required corrective action at these facilities the costs of which could be substantial 

under the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act or cercla the us epa and in some instances private parties have the authority to impose joint and several liability for the remediation of contaminated properties upon generators of waste current and former site owners and operators transporters and other potentially responsible parties regardless of fault or the legality of the original disposal activity many states including indiana have statutes and regulatory authorities similar to cercla and to the us epa we have a number of waste handling agreements with various contractors to properly dispose of our electric arc furnace dust and certain other waste products of steelmaking however we cannot assure you that even if there has been no fault by us we may not still be cited as a waste generator by reason of an environmental clean up at a site to which our waste products were transported 

in addition to rcra and cercla there are a number of other environmental health and safety laws and regulations that apply to our facilities and may affect our operations by way of example and not of limitation certain portions of the federal clean air act clean water act toxic substances control act oil pollution act safe drinking water act and emergency planning and community righttoknow act as well as state and local laws and regulations implemented by the regulatory agencies apply to our facilities operations many of these laws allow both the governments and citizens to bring certain suits against regulated facilities for alleged environmental violations finally any steelmaking company could be subject to certain toxic tort suits brought by citizens or other third parties alleging causes of action such as nuisance negligence trespass infliction of emotional distress or other claims alleging personal injury or property damage 

employees 

our work force consisted of 5990 full time employees at december 31 2009 of which approximately 10 were represented by collective bargaining agreements the largest group of unionized employees is at steel of west virginia the remaining unionized employees are located in 6 

different omnisource metals recycling locations each of which has its own agreement we believe that our relationship with our employees is good

 item 1a risk factors 

  many factors could have an effect on our financial condition cash flows and results of operations we are subject to various risks resulting from changing economic environmental political industry business and financial conditions the factors described below represent our principal risks  

risks related to our industry 

our industry is affected by global economic factors including the risk of a prolonged recession 

our financial results are substantially dependent upon overall economic conditions in the united states in europe and in asia a prolonged or a deepening recession in the united states or globally could substantially further decrease the demand for our products below already currently depressed levels and adversely affect our business many of our products are commodities subject to cyclical fluctuations in supply and demand in both metal consuming industries and in construction metals industries have historically been vulnerable to significant declines in consumption and product pricing during prolonged periods of economic downturn such as at present likewise the pace of construction activity has historically slowed significantly during economic downturns and is at historically low levels today 

our business is also dependent upon certain industries such as commercial and government construction energy metals service centers automotive petrochemical and original equipment manufacturing and these are also cyclical in nature therefore these industries may experience significant fluctuations in demand for our products based on economic conditions energy prices consumer demand and infrastructure funding decisions by governments many of these factors are beyond our control as a result of the volatility in the industries we serve we may have difficulty increasing or maintaining our level of sales or profitability if the industries we serve continue to suffer a prolonged downturn then our business may be further adversely affected 

our level of production and our sales and earnings are subject to significant fluctuations as a result of the cyclical nature of the steel industry and some of the industries we serve 

the steel manufacturing business is cyclical in nature and the price of the steel we make may fluctuate significantly due to many factors beyond our control the timing and magnitude of these price fluctuations are difficult to predict the sale of our manufactured steel products is directly affected by demand for our products in other cyclical industries such as the automotive oil and gas gas transmission residential and commercialindustrial construction commercial equipment rail transportation appliance agricultural and durable goods industries currently the domestic automotive industry which is a major consumer of new steel and a major generator of steel scrap is still suffering from a prolonged and unprecedented downturn continuing to threaten its financial viability despite massive government assistance continued economic difficulties stagnant economies supplydemand imbalances and currency fluctuations in the united states or globally could further decrease the demand for our products or increase the amount of imports of steel into the united states which would decrease our sales margins and profitability 

the scrap metals recycling industry has historically been and is expected to remain highly cyclical a prolonged period of currently low scrap prices or a further fall in scrap metal prices such as the one that began during the latter part of 2008 could have a material adverse effect on our metals recycling operations results when inbound scrap flows are weak it reduces our ability to obtain process and sell recycled metals 

scrap metal prices are volatile and operating results within the metals recycling industry in general have historically been cyclical and are expected to remain highly cyclical in nature similarly but not necessarily paralleling the price fluctuations in the steel business the purchase prices for automobile bodies and various other grades of obsolete and industrial scrap as well as the selling prices for processed and recycled scrap metals we utilize in our own manufacturing process or we resell to others through our metals recycling operations are also currently and may continue to be highly volatile as a metals recycler we may attempt to respond to changing recycled metal selling prices by adjusting the scrap metal purchase prices we would pay but our ability to do this may be limited by competitive or other factors and this in turn could adversely affect our sales and profitability after rising during 2007 and through the summer of 2008 scrap metal prices in global markets fell sharply beginning in the late summer of 2008 as a result of collapsing demand and the resulting excess supply in the industry the fall in prices during this period adversely affected the results of metals recycling companies including our metals recycling company omnisource corporation 

scrap metal prices are also sensitive to trends in other cyclical industries such as the automotive and construction industries and are also adversely affected by increases in steel imports into the united states which may have an adverse impact on steel production in the united states and this could have a corresponding adverse impact on the demand for recycled metal from our metals recycling operations in the past substantial price decreases during periods of economic weakness have not always been offset by commensurate price increases during periods of economic strength although scrap prices have stabilized somewhat the timing and extent of factors that will lead to a recovery to inbound flows of scrap cannot be predicted recovery of inbound volumes will likely depend on a broader recovery from the current global economic downturn although the length and nature of business cycles affecting the scrap metal industry have historically been unpredictable if the downturn in scrap metal realized margins were to be protracted this would materially and adversely affect our revenues and profitability from our metals recycling operations 

imports of steel into the united states have in the past adversely affected and may yet again adversely affect us steel prices which could impact our sales margins and profitability 

excessive imports of steel into the united states as a result of excess world supply have in recent years exerted and may again in the future exert downward pressure on us steel prices and may reduce or may negatively affect our ability to increase our sales margins and profitability us steel producers compete with many foreign producers including those in china competition from foreign producers is typically strong and is periodically exacerbated by weakening of the economies of certain foreign steelmaking countries greater steel exports to the united states tend to occur at depressed prices when steel producing countries experience periods of economic difficulty decreased demand for steel products or excess capacity 

in addition we believe the downward pressure on and periodically depressed levels of us steel prices in some recent years have been further exacerbated by imports of steel involving dumping and subsidy abuses by foreign steel producers some foreign steel producers are owned controlled or subsidized by foreign governments as a result decisions by these producers with respect to their production sales and pricing are often influenced to a greater degree by political and economic policy considerations than by prevailing market conditions realities of the marketplace or consideration of profit or loss however while some tariffs and quotas are currently in effect for certain steel products imported from a number of countries that have been found to have been unfairly pricing steel imports to the us many of these are only shortlived when such tariffs or duties expire or if others are further relaxed or repealed or if relatively higher us steel prices make it attractive for foreign steelmakers to export their steel products to the united states despite the presence of duties or tariffs the resurgence of substantial imports of foreign steel could create downward pressure on us steel prices 

chinas current steelmaking overcapacity in relation to its steel consumption could have a material adverse effect on domestic and global steel pricing and could result in increased steel imports into the united states 

a significant factor in the worldwide volatility of steel pricing in recent years was the explosive growth in chinese steel consumption in relation to its domestic production which until the third quarter of 2008 had vastly outpaced that countrys capacity to produce steel in sufficient quantity to serve its internal demand the shortage of chinese domestic steel supply during this time period resulted not only in heightened chinese demand for imported steel and other raw materials with a consequent upward spiral in worldwide steel pricing for finished steel products but also led to a rapid and significant expansion of steel production capacity in china as well as many of the commodities supplies and services utilized in steelmaking however the subsequent drop in chinese steel consumption that began in 2008 and continued in 2009 in addition to the continued utilization of a large amount of outdated inefficient and government subsidized production capacity has resulted in a situation in which chinas steel producing capacity currently exceeds that countrys demand for many kinds of steel products that we produce making china a net exporter of millions of tons of steel in 2008 and 2009 therefore a combination of a slowdown in chinas economic growth rate and steel consumption coupled with its own expansion of steelmaking capacity could result in a substantial further weakening of both domestic and global steel demand and steel pricing also should chinese steelmaking capacity remain the same or further increase or should its demand either not increase or further weaken china might not only remain a net exporter of steel but many asian and european steel producers whose steel output previously fed chinas steel import needs could find their way into the us market through increased steel imports causing a further erosion of margins or negatively impacting our ability to increase our prices 

the worldwide economic downturn that began in 2008 and the difficult conditions in the global industrial capital and credit markets that resulted have adversely affected and may continue to adversely affect our business and our industry as well as the industries of many of our customers and suppliers upon whom we are dependent 

many of the markets in which our customers participate such as the automotive consumer products original equipment manufacturing commercial residential and government construction and metals service center industries are also cyclical in nature and experience significant fluctuations in demand for our steel products based on economic conditions consumer demand raw material and energy costs and decisions by our government to fund or not fund infrastructure projects such as highways bridges schools energy plants railroads and transportation facilities many of these factors are beyond our control these markets are highly competitive to a large extent driven by enduse markets and may experience overcapacity all of which may affect demand for and pricing of our products 

recent declines in consumer and business confidence and spending together with severe reductions in the availability and cost of credit as well as volatility in the capital and credit markets have adversely affected the business and economic environment in which we operate and the profitability of our business we are exposed to risks associated with the creditworthiness of our suppliers and customers moreover the current worldwide financial crisis has reduced the availability of credit to fund or support the continuation and expansion of our customers business operations the inability of our customers or of their customers to access credit adversely affects our business by reducing our sales and by increasing our exposure to losses from uncollectible customer accounts these conditions and continued disruption of the credit markets could result in financial instability of some of our suppliers and customers the consequences of such adverse effects could include the interruption of production at the facilities of our customers the reduction delay or cancellation of customer orders delays or interruptions of the supply of raw materials we purchase and bankruptcy of customers suppliers or other creditors any of these events may adversely affect our cash flow profitability and financial condition 

moreover the current worldwide financial crisis has reduced the availability of credit to fund or support the continuation and expansion of our customers business operations many lenders and institutional investors have reduced and in some cases ceased to provide funding to borrowers therefore continued disruption of the credit markets has affected and could continue to adversely affect our customers access to credit which supports the continuation and expansion of their businesses and could result in contract cancellations or suspensions payment delays or defaults by our customers 

volatility and major fluctuations in scrap metal and pig iron prices and our potential inability to pass such higher costs on to our customers may constrain operating levels and reduce profit margins 

steel producers require large amounts of raw materials including scrap metal and scrap substitute products such as pig iron pelletized iron and other supplies such as graphite electrodes and ferroalloys our vertical integration into the metals recycling business through our omnisource subsidiary and into the iron making business through our iron dynamics and the recent startup of our mesabi nugget operations will enable us to be our own supplier for some of our metallics requirements however we may still need to rely on other metallics and raw material suppliers as well as upon general industry supply conditions 

purchase prices for auto bodies scrap metal and scrap substitute products such as pig iron that we consume and selling prices for scrap and recycled metals that we sell to third parties are volatile and beyond our control while omnisource attempts to respond to changing recycled metal selling prices through adjustments to its metal purchase prices its ability to do so is limited by competitive and other market factors changing prices could potentially impact the volume of scrap metal available to the company and the volume and realized margins of processed metal sold by the company 

the availability and prices of raw materials may also be negatively affected by new laws and regulations allocation by suppliers interruptions in production accidents or natural disasters changes in exchange rates worldwide price fluctuations and the availability and cost of transportation 

if prices for ferrous metallics and energy increase by a greater margin than corresponding price increases for the sale of our steel products we may not be able to recoup such cost increases from increases in the selling prices of steel products or our inability to pass on all or any substantial part of such cost increases through scrap or other surcharges or to provide for our customers needs because of the potential unavailability of key raw materials or other inputs may result in production curtailments or may otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations or prospects 

the cost and availability of electricity and natural gas are also subject to volatile market conditions 

steel producers like us consume large amounts of energy inasmuch as minimills melt steel scrap in electric arc furnaces and use natural gas to heat steel billets for rolling into finished products we rely on third parties for the supply of energy resources we consume in our steelmaking activities the prices for and availability of electricity natural gas oil and other energy resources are all also subject to volatile market conditions often affected by weather conditions as well as political and economic factors beyond our control as large consumers of electricity and gas we must have dependable delivery in order to operate accordingly we are at risk in the event of an energy disruption prolonged blackouts or brownouts or disruptions caused by natural disasters or by political considerations would substantially disrupt our production moreover much of our finished steel products is typically delivered by truck rapid increases in the price of fuel attributable to increases in crude oil prices would have a negative impact on our costs or on the costs of many of our customers in addition changes in certain environmental regulations in the us including those that may impose output limitations or higher costs associated with climate change or greenhouse gas emissions legislation could substantially increase the cost of manufacturing and raw materials such as energy to us steel producers 

fluctuations in the value of the united states dollar relative to other currencies may adversely affect our business  

fluctuations in the value of the dollar can be expected to affect our business a strong us dollar makes imported metal products less expensive potentially resulting in more imports of steel products into the us by our foreign competitors while a weak us dollar may have the opposite impact on imports 

compliance with and changes in environmental and remediation requirements could result in substantially increased capital requirements and operating costs 

existing laws or regulations as currently interpreted or as may be interpreted in the future as well as future laws or regulations may have a material adverse effect on our results of operation and financial condition 

we are subject to comprehensive local state federal and international statutory and regulatory environmental requirements relating to among other things 

• the acceptance storage treatment handling and disposal of solid and hazardous waste • the discharge of materials into air • the management and treatment of wastewater and storm water • the remediation of soil and groundwater contamination • global climate change legislation or regulation 27 

• the remediation and reclamation of land used for iron mining • natural resource damages and • the protection of our employees health and safety compliance with environmental laws and regulations which affect both our steelmaking and our metals recycling and ironmaking operations is a significant factor in our business we are required to obtain and comply with environmental permits and licenses and failure to obtain or renew or the violation of any permit or license if not remedied could result in substantial fines and penalties suspension of operations or the closure of a subject facility similarly delays in obtaining permits or unanticipated or costly conditions imposed on such permits such as permits we are seeking in connection with our plan to engage in the mining of taconite ore close to our mesabi nugget facility in minnesota could delay a project or affect its profitability private parties might also bring claims against us for alleged property damage or personal injury resulting from the environmental impacts of our operations moreover legal requirements change frequently are subject to interpretation and have tended to become more stringent over time uncertainty regarding adequate pollution control levels testing and sampling procedures and new pollution control technology are factors that may increase our future compliance expenditures we are unable to predict the ultimate cost of future compliance with these requirements or their effect on our operations and we also cannot predict whether such costs can be passed on to customers through product price increases although we believe that we are in substantial compliance with all applicable laws and regulations legal requirements frequently change and are subject to interpretation new laws regulations and changing interpretations by regulatory authorities together with uncertainty regarding adequate pollution control levels testing and sampling procedures new pollution control technology and cost benefit analysis based on market conditions are all factors that may increase our future expenditures to comply with environmental requirements the cost of complying with existing laws or regulations as currently interpreted or reinterpreted in the future or with future laws or regulations may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

our manufacturing and recycling operations produce significant amounts of byproducts some of which are handled as industrial waste or hazardous waste for example our mills generate electric arc furnace eaf dust which the united states environmental protection agency usepa and other regulatory authorities classify as hazardous waste eaf dust requires special handling recycling and disposal 

in addition the primary feed materials for the shredders operated by our metals recycling operations are automobile hulks and obsolete household appliances approximately 20 of the weight of an automobile hulk consists of unrecyclable material known as shredder fluff after the segregation of ferrous and saleable nonferrous metals shredder fluff remains we along with others in the recycling industry interpret federal regulations to require shredder fluff to meet certain criteria and pass a toxic leaching test to avoid classification as a hazardous waste we also endeavor to remove hazardous contaminants from the feed material prior to shredding as a result we believe the shredder fluff we generate is not normally considered or properly classified as hazardous waste however if laws or regulations the interpretation of the laws or regulations or testing methods change with regard to eaf dust or shredder fluff we may incur significant additional expenditures 

the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act cercla or superfund enables usepa and state agencies to recover from owners operators generators and transporters the cost of investigation and cleanup of sites which pose serious threats to the environment or public health in connection with cercla and analogous state laws we may be required to clean up contamination discovered at our sites including contamination that may have been caused by former owners or operators of the sites conduct additional cleanup at sites where we have already participated in remediation efforts or to take remediation action with regard to sites formerly used in connection with our operations 

in addition we may be required to pay for or to pay a portion of the costs of remediation at sites to which we sent hazardous wastes for disposal notwithstanding that the original disposal activity may have complied with all regulatory requirements then in effect pursuant to cercla a potentially responsible party can be held jointly and severally liable for all of the cleanup costs associated with a thirdparty disposal site in practice a liable party often splits the costs of cleanup with other potentially responsible parties we have received notices from usepa state agencies and third parties that it has been identified as potentially responsible for the cost of investigating and cleaning up a number of thirdparty disposal sites in most cases many other parties are also named as potentially responsible parties based upon information currently available to us we do not believe the potential cost in connection with the remediation of these sites will have a material effect on our business 

because cercla can be imposed retroactively on shipments that occurred many years ago and because usepa and state agencies are still discovering sites that pose a threat to public health or the environment we can provide no assurance that we will not become liable in the future for significant costs associated with investigation and remediation of additional cercla clean up sites 

cercla including the superfund recycling equity act of 1999 limits the exposure of scrap metal recyclers for sales of certain recyclable material under certain circumstances however the recycling defense is subject to conducting of reasonable care evaluations of current and potential consuming facilities 

increased regulation associated with climate change and greenhouse gas emissions could impose significant additional costs on both our steelmaking and metals recycling operations 

the united states government or various governmental agencies have introduced or are contemplating regulatory changes in response to the potential impacts of climate change international treaties or agreements may also result in increasing regulation of greenhouse gas emissions including the introduction of carbon emissions trading mechanisms any such regulation regarding climate change and greenhouse gas or ghg emissions could impose significant costs on our steelmaking and metals recycling operations and on the operations of our customers and suppliers including increased energy capital equipment environmental monitoring and reporting and other costs in order to comply with current or future laws or regulations concerning and limitations imposed on our operations by virtue of climate change and ghg emissions laws and regulations the potential costs of allowances offsets or credits that may be part of potential capandtrade programs or similar future regulatory measures are still uncertain any adopted future climate change and ghg regulations could negatively impact our ability and that of our customers and suppliers to compete with companies situated in areas not subject to such limitations from a medium and longterm perspective we are likely to see an increase in costs relating to our assets that emit significant amounts of greenhouse gases as a result of these regulatory initiatives these regulatory initiatives will be either voluntary or mandatory and may impact our operations directly or through our suppliers or customers until the timing scope and extent of any future regulation becomes known we cannot predict the effect on our financial condition operating performance and ability to compete 

risks related to the business 

our senior secured credit agreement contains and any future financing agreements may contain restrictive covenants that may limit our flexibility 

restrictions and covenants in our existing debt agreements including our senior secured credit agreement and any future financing agreements may impair our ability to finance future operations or capital needs or to engage in other business activities specifically these agreements restrict our ability to 

• incur additional indebtedness • pay dividends or make distributions with respect to our capital stock • repurchase or redeem capital stock • make some investments • create liens and enter into sale and leaseback transactions • make some capital expenditures • enter into transactions with affiliates or related persons • issue or sell stock of certain subsidiaries • sell or transfer assets and • participate in some joint ventures acquisitions or mergers a breach of any of the restrictions or covenants could cause a default under our senior secured credit agreement our senior notes or our other debt a significant portion of our indebtedness then may become immediately due and payable if the default is not remedied 

under our senior secured revolving credit facility we are required to maintain certain financial covenants tied to our debt and profitability in addition we are subject to a monthly borrowing base requirement limiting the maximum availability of our senior secured revolver our ability to meet such ratios can be affected by events beyond our control if a default were to occur the lenders could elect to declare all amounts outstanding to be immediately due and payable and terminate all commitments to extend further credit if we are unable to repay those amounts the lenders could proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure such indebtedness we have pledged substantially all of our receivables and inventories and all shares of capital stock or other equity interests of the companys subsidiaries and intercompany debt held by us 

we are exposed to risks associated with the current financial crisis  

financial markets in the us and abroad have experienced extreme disruption including severely diminished liquidity and credit availability resulting both in volatilities in shortterm borrowing costs and in severely constrained credit availability and more stringent borrowing terms recessionary conditions in the global economy have not appreciably improved and could worsen even further these conditions may continue to adversely affect our business in the future particularly if current conditions persist or if there is further deterioration in the world financial markets and major economies these current business and credit conditions also adversely affect the business of our customers difficulties in obtaining capital may lead to their inability to obtain affordable financing to fund their operations resulting in lower demand for our products furthermore liquidity issues could impair the ability of those with whom we do business to satisfy their obligations to us should these constraints on access to credit continue for a prolonged period some of our customers may struggle and fail to meet their obligations to us especially if they in turn experience defaults or slow payment on receivables due from 

their customers a prolonged recession could result in our incurring bad debt costs in excess of our expectations and prior experience 

we may face significant price and other forms of competition from other steel producers and scrap processors which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operation or prospects 

the global markets in which steel companies and metals recyclers conduct business are highly competitive and are becoming even more so due to the current prolonged global economic downturn and to consolidations in recent years in the steel and the metal recycling industries increased competition could cause us to lose market share increase expenditures or reduce pricing any one of which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations or prospects 

we are subject to significant risks relating to changes in commodity prices and may not be able to effectively protect against these risks 

we are exposed to commodity price risk during periods where we hold title to scrap metal products that we may hold in inventory for processing or resale prices of commodities including recycled metals can be volatile due to numerous factors beyond our control in an increasing price environment for raw materials competitive conditions may limit our ability to pass on price increases to our consumers in a decreasing price environment for processed recycled metal we may not have the ability to fully recoup the cost of raw materials that we procure process and sell to our customers in addition new entrants into the market areas we serve could result in higher purchase prices for raw materials and lower margins from our recycled metal we are unable to hedge positions in certain commodities such as recycled ferrous metal where no established futures market exists or where we may from time to time hedge our positions in certain nonferrous metal transactions we could incur losses thus our sales and inventory position will be vulnerable to adverse changes in commodity prices which could materially adversely impact our operating and financial performance 

we may be unable to pass on increases in the cost of ferrous materials and other raw materials to our customers which would reduce our earnings 

if from time to time we are unable to pass on periodic increases in ferrous resource and other raw material costs to our customers we will be less profitable we may not be able to adjust our product prices especially in the shortterm to recover the costs of prolonged increases in raw material prices our principal raw material is scrap metal derived primarily from junked automobiles industrial scrap railroad cars railroad track materials agricultural machinery and demolition scrap from obsolete structures containers and machines the prices for scrap are subject to market forces largely beyond our control including demand by us and international steel producers freight costs and speculation the prices for scrap have varied significantly may vary significantly in the future and do not necessarily fluctuate in tandem with the price of steel moreover some of our integrated steel producer competitors are not as dependent as we are on scrap as a part of their raw material melt mix which during periods of high scrap costs relative to the cost of blast furnace iron used by the integrated producers give them a raw material cost advantage over minimills in addition our operations require substantial amounts of other raw materials including various types of pig iron alloys refractories graphite electrodes oxygen natural gas and electricity the price and availability of which are also subject to market conditions 

the profitability of our metals recycling operations depends in part on the availability of an adequate source of supply 

we procure our recyclable metal inventory from numerous sources these suppliers generally are not bound by longterm contracts and have no obligation to sell recyclable metal to us in periods of low industry prices suppliers may elect to hold recyclable metal to wait for higher prices or intentionally slow their metal collection activities if a substantial number of suppliers cease selling recyclable metal to us we will be unable to recycle metal at desired levels and our results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected in addition a slowdown of industrial production in the united states as has recently occurred reduces the supply of industrial grades of metal to the metal recycling industry resulting in our having less recyclable metal available to process and market 

competition from other materials may have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations or prospects 

in many applications steel competes with other materials such as aluminum and plastics particularly in the automobile industry cement composites glass and wood increased use of or additional substitutes for steel products could adversely affect future market prices and demand for steel products 

we may face risks associated with the implementation of our growth strategy 

our growth strategy subjects us to various risks as part of our growth strategy we may expand existing facilities build additional plants acquire other businesses and steel assets enter into joint ventures or form strategic alliances that we believe will complement our existing business these transactions will likely involve some or all of the following risks 

• the difficulty of competing for acquisitions and other growth opportunities with companies having materially greater financial resources than ours • the inability to realize anticipated synergies or other benefits expected from an acquisition • the difficulty of integrating the acquired operations and personnel into our existing businesses • the potential disruption of ongoing businesses • the diversion of financial resources to acquired businesses • the diversion of management attention from other business concerns to acquired businesses • the loss of key employees and customers of acquired businesses • the potential exposure to unknown liabilities • the inability of management to maintain uniform standards controls procedures and policies • the difficulty of managing the growth of a larger company • the risk of entering markets in which we have little experience • the risk of becoming involved in labor commercial or regulatory disputes or litigation related to the new enterprise • the risk of becoming more highly leveraged • the risk of contractual or operational liability to other venture participants or to third parties as a result of our participation • the inability to work efficiently with joint venture or strategic alliance partners and 32 

• the difficulties of terminating joint ventures or strategic alliances these transactions might be required for us to remain competitive but we may not be able to complete any such transactions on favorable terms or obtain financing if necessary for such transactions on favorable terms future transactions may not improve our competitive position and business prospects as anticipated and if they do not our sales and earnings may be significantly reduced 

technology operating and startup risks as well as commodity market risks associated with our mesabi nugget ironmaking project may prevent us from realizing its anticipated benefits and could result in a loss of all or a part of our investment 

while we and certain of our current and former joint venture partners built and operated a successful small scale pilot plant on the mesabi iron range in minnesota for the production of a cost effective iron nugget using kobe steels proprietary itmk3® ironmaking process there are technology operational market and startup risks associated with the construction recent commissioning and startup of our worlds first full scale commercial nugget plant utilizing this technology although we believe this full scale plant should be capable of consistently producing highquality iron nuggets for use as a scrap substitute feed stock in our steelmaking operations and in sufficient quantities and at a cost that will compare favorably with the cost of steel scrap and other more conventional scrap substitute products including pig iron there can be no assurance that these expectations will be achieved if we encounter cost overruns systems or process difficulties during or after startup or quality control or output restrictions our capital costs could materially increase the expected cost benefits from the development of this iron nugget product could be diminished or lost and we could lose all or a substantial portion of our investment in the project we could also encounter commodity market risk if during a sustained period the cost to manufacture the nuggets is greater than projected or if the relative market price of scrap and other scrap substitutes for which this iron nugget product is intended as a lower cost substitute is lower than projected which could render our nuggets noneconomical moreover we are undertaking certain ancillary ventures related to the ironmaking process such as our nearby mesabi mining facility currently under construction for the mining and concentration of taconite ore for use in the production of nuggets a business in which we have no experience and which is also subject to possible permitting and environmental risks and uncertainties 

we are subject to litigation which could adversely affect our profitability  

we are involved in various routine litigation matters including administrative proceedings regulatory proceedings governmental investigations environmental matters and commercial and construction contract disputes 

we were involved as the sole defendant in a february 1 2008 lawsuit by prime eagle group limited seeking damages in excess of 11 billion but on february 23 2009 pursuant to our motion to dismiss that action the united states district court for the northern district of indiana granted our motion to dismiss with prejudice and denied the plaintiffs the right to amend their complaint the plaintiffs in that lawsuit appealed the dismissal to the united states court of appeals for the seventh circuit and that appeal is still pending 

we are also involved as one of nine defendants in a september 12 2008 class action antitrust complaint by standard iron works and others involving alleged antitrust violations of section 1 of the sherman act we and the other defendants filed a joint motion to dismiss these actions and our motion to dismiss was denied some discovery will shortly commence in these proceedings we are contesting and will continue to vigorously contest 

due to the uncertain nature of litigation we cannot predict the outcome of these matters these matters however could have a material adverse affect on our financial condition and profitability 

litigation is very costly and the costs associated with prosecuting and defending litigation matters could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and profitability although we are unable to estimate the dollar amount of exposure to loss if any in connection with many litigation matters we make accruals as warranted we have also asserted insurance claims where appropriate however the amounts that we may accrue from time to time could vary significantly from the amounts we actually pay due to inherent uncertainties and the inherent shortcomings of the estimation process the uncertainties involved in litigation and other factors 

unexpected equipment failures may lead to production curtailments or shutdowns  

interruptions in our production capabilities could adversely affect our production costs products available for sales and earnings during the affected period in addition to equipment failures our facilities are also subject to the risk of catastrophic loss due to unanticipated events such as fires explosions or violent weather conditions our manufacturing processes are dependent upon critical pieces of steelmaking equipment such as our furnaces continuous casters and rolling equipment as well as electrical equipment such as transformers this equipment may on occasion be out of service as a result of unanticipated failures we have experienced and may in the future experience material plant shutdowns or periods of reduced production as a result of such equipment failures 

some of our operations present significant risk of injury or death 

the industrial activities conducted at our facilities present significant risk of serious injury or death to our employees customers or other visitors to our operations notwithstanding our safety precautions including our material compliance with federal state and local employee health and safety regulations while we have in place policies and procedures to minimize such risks we may nevertheless be unable to avoid material liabilities for an injury or death even though we maintain workers compensation insurance to address the risk of incurring material liabilities for injury or death there can be no assurance that the insurance coverage will be adequate or will continue to be available on the terms acceptable to us or at all which could result in material liabilities for an injury or death 

governmental agencies may refuse to grant or renew some of our licenses and permits 

we must receive licenses permits and approvals from state and local governments to conduct certain of our operations or to develop or acquire new facilities governmental agencies often resist the establishment of certain types of facilities in their communities including scrap metal collection and processing facilities there can be no assurance that future approvals licenses and permits will be granted or that we will be able to maintain and renew the approvals licenses and permits we currently hold and failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

our common stock price may fluctuate substantially 

the market price of our common stock has experienced and may continue to experience significant volatility numerous factors including many over which we have no control may have a significant impact on the market price of our common stock these risks include those described or referred to in this risk factors section and in the other documents incorporated herein by reference as well as among other things 

• our actual or anticipated fluctuations in our operating and financial performance and prospects • perceptions regarding the level of our debt • investor perceptions relating to our products our industry and the markets in which we operate • market conditions in the end markets into which we or our customers sell our products 34 

• changes in industry forecasts earnings estimates or buysell recommendations by analysts and • broad financial domestic international economic and other market conditions in addition the stock market in recent years has experienced significant price and trading volume fluctuations that often have been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of individual companies these broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the price of our common stock regardless of our operating performance as a result of these factors among others the value of your investment may decline because a decrease in the market price of our common stock would likely adversely impact the trading price of the notes 

payment of dividends will depend on our future financial condition and performance 

while our board of directors has been authorizing the payment of regular quarterly cash dividends on shares of our common stock the timing and amount of future dividends will depend on the boards assessment of our operations financial condition projected cash needs contractual restrictions or restrictions imposed by applicable law and other factors we cannot guarantee that we will continue to declare dividends or declare them at the same or similar rates in addition our senior secured credit agreement and the indenture relating to our notes restrict the amount of cash dividends we can pay

 item 2 properties 

the following table describes our more significant properties as of december 31 2009 these properties are owned by us and are not subject to any significant encumbrances we believe these properties are suitable and adequate for our current operations and are appropriately utilized 



 the mesabi nugget and mesabi mining properties are located at the site of an open pit taconite mine on the mesabi iron range near hoyt lakes minnesota the site encompasses land owned outright by us including mineral and surface rights and land for which we acquired a leasehold interest including mineral and surface rights the properties were purchased from cleveland cliffs inc and the mines were formerly operated by ltv corporation mesabi mining is currently attempting to obtain the necessary permits to commence mining operations during 2011 the concentrate eventually provided by the mines is intended as a raw material input for the iron nugget production 36 

mesabi nugget began the commissioning process of the facility in the fourth quarter of 2009 and by the end of december all individual production systems were operational and prepared for integration nuggets were produced on january 12 2010 the facility continues to test and refine the process during its initials startup phase

competitive strengthsbusiness strategy 

  one of the lowest cost steel producers in the united states stateoftheart facilitiescontinue to maintain low production costs 

we believe that our facilities are among the lowestcost steel producing facilities in the united states our low operating costs are primarily a result of our efficient plant designs and operations our high productivity rate such as our productivity rate of approximately 3 man hours per hot band ton produced at our flat roll divisions mill low ongoing maintenance cost requirements and strategic locations near sources of our primary raw material scrap steel and our customers 

we are focused on continuing to maintain and enhance one of the lowest operating cost structures in the north american steel industry based upon operating cost per ton we will continue to strive to optimize the use of our equipment enhance our productivity and explore new technologies to further improve our unit costs of production at each of our facilities including newly acquired facilities

  diversified product mixexpand product offerings 

our current products in our steel segment include hot rolled cold rolled galvanized galvalume® and painted sheet steel various structural steel beams and rails special bar quality steel various merchant steel products including beams angles flats and channels in addition our products include in the metals recycling segment an array of both ferrous and nonferrous scrap processing scrap management transportation and brokerage and trading products and services finally our steel fabrication segment produces steel joists and decking materials this diversified mix of products enables us to access a broader range of enduser markets serve a broader customer base and mitigate our exposure to cyclical downturns in commodity grade flat rolled products or in any one product or enduser market 

we will continue to seek additional opportunities to further expand our range of products through the expansion of existing facilities greenfield projects and acquisitions of other steel producers or steelmaking assets as well as scrap recycling companies that may become available through the continuing consolidation of both the domestic steel and recycling industries completion of the our new medium section structural rolling mill at our columbia city indiana facility acquisitions of omnisource recycle south and the techs as well as the expansions and upgrades of existing facilities notably the bar finishing facility in pittsboro and the addition of a paint line and galvalume® production capabilities in jeffersonville are important steps in pursuing our strategy of product line expansion the development of our mesabi nugget project further will expand our product offerings 

  strategic geographic locationsenter new geographic markets 

the locations of our steelmaking facilities near sources of scrap materials and near our customer base allow us to realize freight savings for inbound scrap as well as for outbound steel products destined for our customers steel scrap and scrap substitutes represent the most significant component of our cost of steel manufacturing our scrap facilities are located in the upper midwest and southeastern united states which we believe account for a majority of the total scrap produced in the united states our jeffersonville indiana galvanizing facility located on the ohio river also provides us with an expanded geographic reach to southern markets our scrap processing facilities are located in multiple states throughout the midwest and south atlantic regions 

we may seek to enter new steel markets in strategic geographic locations that offer attractive growth opportunities our acquisition of the techs in pittsburgh pa and our expansion of the jeffersonville facility on the ohio river which provides access to southern markets are examples of such activities in addition the location of certain recycle south metals recycling facilities in the southeastern region of the united states further expands our geographic service areas 

industry segments 

under statement of financial accounting standards board statement no 131 disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information  we have three reportable segments steel operations metals recycling and ferrous resources operations and steel fabrication operations 

steel operations 

our steel operations segment consists of steel making and coating operations the following chart summarizes the locations and the capacities of the facilities in the broad categories 





1 furnaces are expected to be expanded when needed resulting in increased capacity 2 the increase is due to the anticipated completion of a second caster in the second half of 2009 3 the increase is due to the anticipated expansion of melting and rolling capacity 4 excess billet tonnage available for sale note capacities represent the capabilities based on mill configuration and the related employee support these capacities do not represent expected volumes in a given year in addition estimates of mill capacity particularly rolling capacity are highly dependent on the specific product mix manufactured each of our mills can and do roll many different types and sizes of products therefore our capacity estimates assume a typical product mix sheet products 

our steel sheet products are produced by both our flat roll division which consists of our flat roll mill galvanizing and paint facilities in butler indiana our galvanizing and paint facilities in jeffersonville indiana and the techs a pennsylvaniabased galvanizing company which operates three galvanizing facilities galvtech metaltech and nextech 

our butler mill manufactures flat rolled hot rolled cold rolled and coated steel products we produced 26 million tons and 24 million tons at this facility in 2007 and 2008 respectively our products are characterized by high quality surface characteristics precise tolerances and light gauge in addition this mill has achieved iso 90012000—ansiisoasq q90012000 certification we believe that these certifications have enabled us to serve a broader range of customers who may require certifications for themselves or to satisfy the endusers of our steel products 

our butler mill has two twinshell electric arc furnaces which enable us to melt scrap in one vessel while tapping the other vessel and refilling it with scrap and scrap substitute to make it ready for the next heat this results in more heats and greater productivity per shift we have three ladle metallurgy stations two continuous thinslab casters which produce twoinch slabs and two tunnel furnaces our hot rolling mill which progressively reduces the slab in thickness consists of a sevenstand rolling mill capable of rolling sheet steel down to 10mm with excellent surface quality which enables us to access markets previously available only to more costly cold finished material 

our jeffersonville indiana cold rolled galvanizing facility is located within the clark maritime centre on the ohio river this facility is capable of coating cold rolled steel in gauges from 008 to 045 inches and in widths between 24 and 60 inches this gauge range is lighter than that available from our butler facility and creates further expansion of our value added product offerings the galvanizing line was built in 1999 and is similar to the cold rolled galvanizing line at our butler facility in 2007 and early 2008 we completed the addition of three strategic capabilities at our jeffersonville facility this expansion allows us to produce prepainted steel acryliccoated steel and galvalume® coated steel our butler facility provides our jeffersonville facility with cold rolled material 

the techs facilities have galvanizing lines with varying capabilities nextech is capable of coating cold rolled steel in gauges from 007 to 020 inches and in widths between 24 and 43 inches galvtech is capable of coating cold rolled steel in gauges from 012 to 040 inches and in widths between 30 and 60 inches metaltech is capable of coating cold rolled steel in gauges from 015 to 160 inches and in widths between 24 and 52 inches in addition to third party steel producers our butler facility provides the techs with required steel material the techs has achieved the iso 90012000—ansiisoasq q90012000 certification 

the following table summarizes the mix of types of sheet products we sold during the respective years 



hot rolled products our flat roll mill produces hot rolled products that include a variety of high quality mild and medium carbon and high strength low alloy hot rolled bands in 40 inches to 62 inches widths and in thicknesses from 500 inches down to 043 inches we also produce an array of lighter gauge hot rolled products including high strength low alloy and medium carbon steels these products are suitable for automobile suspension arms frames wheels and other unexposed parts in auto and truck bodies truck trailer and recreational vehicle parts and components mechanical and structural steel tubing gas and fluid transmission piping building and construction products rail cars ships 

barges and other marine equipment agricultural equipment and farm implements lawn garden and recreation equipment industrial machinery and shipping containers and highway guard rails we believe that our basic hot rolled material has shape characteristics that exceed those of other thinslab flat roll minimills and compares favorably with those of the integrated mills 

we sell a portion of our hot rolled coils produced at our butler facility directly to endusers or to intermediate steel processors or service centers where they may be pickled cold rolled annealed tempered galvanized or painted by those customers the rest of hot rolled coils are directed to our cold mill where we add value to this product through our own pickling cold rolling annealing tempering galvanizing and painting processes a portion of our cold rolled production is shipped to our jeffersonville indiana galvanizing facility at our butler facility our cold mill is located adjacent to our hot mill and produces products that require gauges properties or surface conditions that cannot be achieved in our hot mill 

cold rolled products cold rolled steel is hot rolled steel that has been further processed through a pickler and then passed through a rolling mill until the desired gauge or thickness and other physical properties have been achieved cold rolling reduces gauge and hardens the steel and when further processed through an annealing furnace and a temper mill improves uniformity ductility and formability cold rolling can also impart various surface finishes and textures cold rolled steel is used in exposed steel applications that demand higher surface quality or finish such as exposed automobile and appliance panels as a result of higher processing costs cold rolled prices are typically higher than hot rolled prices cold rolled material is often coated or painted 

coated products hot rolled or cold rolled steel can be coated with zinc to render it corrosionresistant and to improve its paintability galvanized galvannealed galvalume® electrogalvanized and aluminized products are types of coated steels these are also the highest valueadded sheet products because they require the greatest degree of processing and tend to have the strictest quality requirements coated steel is used in high volume applications such as automobiles household appliances roofing and siding heating and air conditioning equipment air ducts switch boxes chimney flues awnings garbage cans and food containers 

we also produce hot rolled pickled and oiled hot rolled galvanized hot rolled galvannealed cold rolled galvanized cold rolled galvannealed and fully processed cold rolled sheet as a result of our lighter gauge hot rolling capabilities we are able to produce hot rolled galvanized and galvannealed steel products these products are capable of replacing products that have traditionally only been available as more costly cold rolled galvanized or cold rolled galvannealed steel this material is typically used in transportation products building products such as raised garage door panels heating and cooling products appliances furniture and lighting equipment 

our butler indiana paint line located adjacent to our cold mill is capable of coating in gauges from 010 to 070 inches and in widths ranging from 36 to 64 inches the paint line receives material directly from our other processing lines and is capable of painting hot rolled galvanized coil cold rolled coil and cold rolled galvanized coil the line incorporates stateoftheart coil coating equipment with quick color change capability and online color matching we believe that we are the only mill in north america with an onsite paint line which we believe enables us to realize substantial savings in overhead maintenance engineering sales and marketing capital investment and infrastructure costs and allows us to eliminate the typical cost of transfer freight that a customer must otherwise pay to transport coils to other remote coating facilities 

customers steel processors and service centers typically act as intermediaries between primary steel producers and the many enduser manufacturers that require further processing of hot rolled coils the additional processing performed by the intermediate steel processors and service centers include pickling galvanizing cutting to length slitting to size leveling blanking shape correcting edge rolling 

shearing and stamping we expect that our intermediate steel processor and service center customers will remain an integral part of our customer base the location of our jeffersonville facility on the ohio river also creates opportunities for market expansion into other geographic regions our flat roll divisions sales inside the united states accounted for approximately 95 of the divisions net sales in 2008 

during 2008 we sold our flat rolled products to approximately 400 customers heidtman steel products inc which is principally owned by one of our directors accounted for approximately 5 and 4 of our consolidated net sales in 2007 and 2008 respectively 

the techs produces galvanized flat rolled products that are similar to those produced by our flat roll division and sold to a similar customer base each of the techs facilities specializes in the galvanizing of specific types of flat rolled steels in nonautomotive applications servicing a variety of customers in the heating ventilation and air conditioning hvac commercial construction and consumer goods markets about 97 of the techs sales are to customers in the eastern us and the midwest 

the following table shows information about the types of customers sheet products were sold to during the respective years 



markets flat rolled products represent the largest portion of the domestic steel market flat rolled products consist of hot rolled cold rolled and coated steel the following table shows the us shipments of these products as reported by the american iron and steel institute aisi 



1 includes pipetube sheet strip and plate in coils 2 includes blackplate sheet strip and electrical 3 includes tin coated hot dipped galvanized electrogalvanized and all other metallic coated competitors our flat roll divisions products compete with many north american integrated hot rolled coil producers such as us steels plants near detroit michigan granite city illinois gary indiana dravosburg pennsylvania and fairfield alabama ak steel corporations plant in middletown ohio and mittal steels facilities in east chicago illinois riverdale illinois cleveland

long products 

structural 

our columbia city indiana structural mill is currently designed to produce structural steel beams pilings and other steel components for the construction transportation and industrial machinery markets as well as standard and premium grade rails for the railroad industry 

we produced 12 million tons and 11 million tons at this facility during 2007 and 2008 respectively our facility melts scrap and scrap substitutes in two singleshell electric arc furnaces during 2008 we completed construction of a second rolling mill to produce medium sections and continued the construction of our second caster at this facility our existing continuous caster is capable of casting four strands of various sized blooms and beam blanks in varying lengths of 17 to 48 feet we can transport the cast strands directly through a reheat furnace to our original fourstand all reversing hot rolling mill to our new medium section rolling mill or into a storage area for reheating and rolling in either mill at a later time the hot rolling mills roll the product into either a structural steel product or a rail product the addition of the new medium section mill allows us to add lighterweight structural shapes and merchant bars to our product offerings from this facility our columbia city indiana facility has achieved the iso 90012000—ansiisoasq q90012000 certification 

products we have the capability to produce various structural steel products such as wide flange beams american standard beams miscellaneous beams h piling material american standard and miscellaneous channels bulb angles and zees the following listing shows structural steel products and their intended markets 



we have also initiated certain value added services for the midwestern fabricator market including exact length and exact piece count capabilities 

customers the principal customers for our structural steel products are steel service centers steel fabricators and various manufacturers service centers though not the ultimate enduser provide 

valuable mill distribution functions to the fabricators and manufacturers including small quantity sales repackaging cutting preliminary processing and warehousing the majority of our structural steel products are sold to service centers 

sales of structural steel products are sensitive to the level of construction activity including infrastructure development which is in turn affected by such cyclical factors as general economic conditions interest rates inflation consumer and government spending and employment 

markets according to the steel manufacturers association domestic structural steel consumption in 2006 2007 and 2008 was approximately 87 million tons 84 million tons and 76 million tons respectively consumption of structural steel products is influenced both by new construction and manufacturing activity and by the selection of steel over alternative structural or manufacturing materials customers in the united states markets accounted for 88 of the divisions net sales in 2008 

competitors our structural steel products compete with various electric arc furnace structural steelmakers some of which have cost structures and flexible management cultures similar to our own notable competitors include nucor steel in berkeley south carolina nucoryamato steel in blytheville arkansas gerdau ameristeel in midlothian texas and petersburg virginia and arcelor mittal in laplace louisiana the nucor minimills and the gerdau ameristeel minimills have accounted for the majority of tons produced in north america over the past three years we also believe however that both geography and product choice will play significant roles there are currently no other structural mills located in the midwest one of the largest structural steel consuming regions in the united states and we believe we can provide freightsaving and customer service benefits to service centers fabricators and manufacturers located in the region we also believe that most of canadas structural steel consumption is located in canadas eastern provinces closer to us than to either of our two largest competitors moreover we intend to provide a broad product mix focusing on the midrange and larger section served only by nucoryamato steel and gerdau ameristeel from locations more remote than our minimill 

rail products 

our columbia city indiana mill also is designed to produce standard and premium grade rails for the railroad industry we produced and shipped approximately 4000 tons of industrial quality rails during 2008 in addition we continue the development of our railwelding facility which we plan to use to weld our longer length rails to lengths up to 1600 feet such long strings offer substantial savings to the railroads both in terms of initial capital cost and through reduced maintenance in contrast current production of rail in the united states and available imported rail is limited to 80foot lengths as a result of existing plant layout restrictions and the physical limitations of ocean freight 

products we are currently capable of manufacturing standard rail grades in a range of weights from 115 lbs per yard to 141 lbs per yard in highly desirable 240 feet rail lengths which no one else presently produces in or imports into the united states or canadian rail markets

ferrous scrap comes from two primary sources i manufacturers and industrial plants metal fabrication plants machine shops and factories which generate steel scrap referred to as prompt or industrial scrap and ii scrap dealers retail individuals auto wreckers demolition firms and others who generate steel and iron scrap referred to as obsolete scrap market demand and the composition quality size weight and location of the materials are the primary factors that determine prices we purchase nonferrous scrap from three primary sources i manufacturers and other nonferrous scrap sources which generate or sell scrap aluminum copper stainless steel and other nonferrous metals ii producers of electricity telecommunication service providers aerospace defense and recycling companies that generate nonferrous scrap consisting primarily of copper wire aluminum beverage cans and various other metals and alloys and iii retail individuals who deliver directly to our facilities material which they collect from a variety of sources we also collect ferrous and nonferrous scrap from sources other than those that are delivered directly to our processing facilities by placing retrieval boxes near these sources the boxes are subsequently transported to our processing facilities 

our scrap metal recycling facilities consist of offices warehouse buildings and open air collection and processing facilities of various sizes and acreages equipped with specialized equipment for processing both ferrous and nonferrous metal we receive sort process and store the metals we equip our facilities with scales shears baling presses briquetting machines conveyors and magnetic separators which enable us to efficiently process large volumes of scrap metals to facilitate processing shipping and receiving we equip our ferrous metal processing centers with presses shredders or hydraulic shears to prepare and compress scrap metal for easier handling cranes are utilized to handle scrap metals for processing and to load material for shipment many facilities have rail access as ferrous scrap is primarily shipped by open gondola railcar additionally several of the metals recycling divisions have achieved the iso 90012000 certification 

products our scrap operations primarily involve the purchase processing and resale of ferrous and nonferrous scrap metals into reusable forms and grades 

we produce an array of ferrous products used in foundry and steel mill applications for use in our own steel mills or for resale to other customers through a variety of methods including sorting shearing cutting torching baling shredding briquetting and breaking our major ferrous products include heavy melting steel busheling bundled scrap shredded scrap and other scrap metal products such as steel turnings and cast iron these products vary in properties or attributes related to cleanness size of individual pieces and residual alloys these factors are determined by the specific needs and requirements of the consumer and affect the individual products relative value we process nonferrous products including aluminum brass copper stainless steel and other nonferrous metals for use in foundry mill refining and smelting applications our superior aluminum alloys operations produce specification aluminum alloys in the form of ingots sows and molten metal in addition omnisource provides transportation logistics truck rail and river barge management services marketing brokerage and consulting services related to the scrap industry 

customers we sell processed ferrous scrap to endusers such as steel producing minimills like ours integrated steelmakers foundries secondary smelters and metal brokers who aggregate materials for other large users most of our ferrousscrap customers purchase processed scrap through negotiated spot sales contracts which establish a quantity purchase for the month the price we charge for ferrous scrap depends upon market demand and transportation costs as well as the quality and grade of the scrap in many cases our selling price also includes the cost of transportation to the enduser 

we sell processed nonferrous scrap to endusers such as specialty steelmakers foundries aluminum sheet and ingot manufacturers copper refineries and smelters brass and bronze ingot manufacturers wire and cable producers utilities and telephone networks 

markets according to the institute of scrap recycling industries isri more than 80 million tons of recycled iron and steel are processed annually in the united states worldwide scrap generation is estimated to be approximately 500 million tons per year scrap is a global commodity influenced by conditions in a number of industrialized countries throughout asia europe and north america isri estimates that 156 million tons of ferrous scrap was exported from the us in 2007 market pricing of scrap was characterized in 2008 by high volatility for example pricing for no 1 bundles a scrap commodity ranged from 125 to 865 per ton in 2008 

scrap metal supplies are generated from a variety of sources industrial scrap or home scrap is generated from steel processing and manufacturing facilities utilizing steel in their production process obsolete scrap including post consumer waste demolition of steel structures and automobiles represent a significant source of scrap generation we do not purchase a material amount of scrap metal from a single source or from a limited number of major sources 

competitors the markets for scrap metals are highly competitive both in the purchase of raw scrap and the sale of processed scrap with regard to the purchase of raw scrap we compete with 

numerous independent recyclers as well as smaller scrap companies engaged only in collecting industrial scrap in many cases we also purchase unprocessed scrap metal from smaller scrap dealers and other processors successful procurement of materials is determined primarily by the price offered by the purchaser for the raw scrap and the proximity of our processing facility to the source of the raw scrap both ferrous and nonferrous scrap sells as a commodity in both national and international markets which are affected by relative economic conditions currency fluctuations and the availability and cost of transportation competition for sales of processed scrap is based primarily on the price quality and location of the scrap metals as well as the level of service provided in terms of reliability and timing of delivery 

we also face potential competition for sales of processed scrap from other producers of steel products such as integrated steel mills and minimills which may vertically integrate their current operations by entering the scrap metals recycling business or by their attempting to secure scrap supply through direct purchasing from our suppliers a number of steel manufacturers currently operate their own scrap yards scrap metals processors also face competition from substitutes for prepared ferrous scrap such as prereduced iron pellets hot briquetted iron pig iron iron carbide and other forms of processed iron the availability and relative prices of substitutes for ferrous scrap could result in a decreased demand for processed ferrous scrap and could result in lower prices andor lower demand for our scrap products 

the industry is highly fragmented with many smaller family owned companies although omnisource also competes with a number of national and global companies each of which has multiple locations in areas in which omnisource also operates these include the david j joseph co acquired by nucor corporation in 2008 sims metal management ferrous processing and trading co aleris international cmc a division of commercial metals newell and darlington shredding in addition omnisource competes with many regional scrap companies no single scrap metals recycler has a significant market share in the domestic market 

ferrous resources 

sources availability and cost of steel raw materials 

scrap metals our principal raw material of our steel operations segment is scrap metal derived from among other sources home scrap generated internally at steel mills themselves industrial scrap generated as a byproduct of manufacturing and obsolete scrap recycled from endoflife automobiles appliances railroad cars and railroad track materials agricultural machinery and demolition scrap from obsolete structures containers and machines 

scrap typically comprises approximately 8085 of the metallic melt mix in electric arc furnace steelmaking in contrast to integrated mill steelmaking where the proportion of scrap has traditionally been approximately 20 depending upon the scrap substitute material that may be available from time to time and the relative cost of such material the percentage of scrap used in our steelmaking operations could be reduced to the range of 60 or less of our metallic melt mix 

many variables can impact scrap prices all of which reflect the pushes and pulls of the supply demand equation these factors include the level of us new steel production for high quality low residual scrap is a byproduct of new steel manufacturing activity the level of exports of scrap from the united states the amount of obsolete scrap production and the effect of speculation on the amount of scrap offered on the market from time to time generally as domestic steel demand increases so does scrap demand and resulting scrap prices the reverse is also normally but not always true with scrap prices following steel prices downward when supply exceeds demand according to isri scrap recyclers in the us annually recycle more than 80 million tonnes of ferrous scrap and 8 million tons of nonferrous scrap 

the price of steel scrap as a commodity has tended to be volatile rising and falling with supply and demand and not always in lock step with or in proportion to the market price of new steel when scrap costs greatly accelerate this threatens one of the principal elements of a minimills traditional lower cost structure—the cost of its metallic raw material therefore having a lower cost alternative source of iron for a portion of a minimills melt mix if realizable would partially buffer the effects of high scrap prices and scrap price volatility with the growing proportion of electric furnace steelmaking both worldwide and domestically we believe that the benefit of developing a costeffective alternate iron source to augment scrap our primary raw material makes good economic sense in the long run 

scrap substitutes direct reduced iron hot briquetted iron and pig iron can substitute for a limited portion of the steel scrap used in electric furnace minimill steel production during 2008 we consumed 56 million tons of metallic materials in our steel making furnaces and approximately 7 by weight was scrap substitutes mainly imported pig iron our iron dynamics operations supplied 256000 tons of those scrap substitutes all purchases of scrap substitutes were made on the spot market at prevailing market prices 

iron dynamics 

since 1997 iron dynamics has worked to develop and commercialize a process of producing a form of iron that might serve as a lower cost substitute for a portion of the metallic raw material mix that goes into our electric arc furnaces to be melted into new steel direct reduced iron is a metallic product made from iron ore or iron ore fines that have been treated in a direct reduction furnace such as a rotary hearth furnace with either natural gas or coal to reduce the iron oxide to metallic iron the method selected by iron dynamics is one that uses coal as the reducing agent the direct reduced iron or dri is then compacted by briquetters to form hot briquetted iron or hbi which is stable and can be immediately used in our melting furnaces or stockpiled for later use liquid pig iron the ultimate end product intended to be produced by iron dynamics is a pure metal product produced by smelting the direct reduced iron in a submerged arc furnace we have used and plan to use all of iron dynamics hbi and liquid pig iron in our steelmaking operations 

since the plants initial startup in august 1999 we have made continuous process design and equipment modifications as we encountered various quality and consistency issues with this pioneering technology in connection with the liquid pig iron conversion process the direct reduced iron is first liquefied and the hot liquid pig iron is then transferred in ladles to the flat roll mills melt shop and combined with scrap steel in the mills electric arc furnaces during 2008 the iron dynamics facility produced 268000 tonnes of direct reduced iron of which 68000 tonnes were converted into hbi and 148000 tonnes were converted into liquid pig iron 

mesabi nugget and mesabi mining 

we have begun construction on our announced mesabi nugget ironmaking project at hoyt lakes minnesota this plant is anticipated to be the worlds first commercial ironmaking facility to use the itmk3® process an ironnugget production technology pioneered by kobe steel ltd which kobe steel is licensing to the venture we hold an equity position of 85 million or 81 equity interest while kobe steel holds an equity position of 20 million or 19 minority equity interest the project involves the construction of a 265 million ironnugget manufacturing facility utilizing ironore concentrate coal and natural gas annual ironnugget production capacity is expected to be 500000 tonnes we anticipate that substantially all of the iron output from the planned nugget plant will be consumed in our mills we believe that this new business will be capable of providing a cost effective source of iron units to our steel mills that is of equal or higher quality than purchased pig iron we currently anticipate the production of nuggets to commence in the second half of 2009 

we also plan to reopen an existing iron mine on the mesabi iron range and to construct a facility for concentrating iron ore we have purchased land on the mesabi iron range in minnesota that is expected to provide a longterm supply of iron ore in the future we plan to process the iron ore and use it as raw material feedstock for the nugget plant in total the cost of this venture is estimated to be approximately 165 million operations could begin in late year 2010

research and development 

our research and development efforts have consisted of efforts to develop or improve our operating practices and our efforts to develop and improve alternative ironmaking technologies through iron dynamics and our investment in mesabi nugget with the exception of mesabi nugget most of these research and development efforts have been conducted inhouse by our employees 

environmental matters 

our steel operations metals recycling and ferrous resources and steel fabrication operations are subject to substantial and evolving local state and federal environmental health and safety laws and regulations concerning among other things emissions to the air discharges to surface and ground water and to sewer systems and the generation handling storage transportation treatment and disposal of toxic and hazardous substances in particular our steel manufacturing operations are dependent upon both state and federal permits regulating discharges into the air or into the water in order to operate our facilities we believe that in all current respects our steel operations metals recycling and ferrous resources and steel fabrication operations are in material compliance with all provisions of federal and state laws concerning the environment and we do not currently believe that future compliance with such provisions will have a material adverse effect on our results of operations cash flows or financial condition 

since the level of enforcement of environmental laws and regulations or the nature of those laws that may be enacted from time to time are sometimes subject to changing social or political pressures our environmental capital expenditures and costs for environmental compliance may increase in the future in addition due to the possibility of unanticipated regulatory or other developments the amount and timing of future environmental expenditures may vary substantially from those currently anticipated the cost of current and future environmental compliance may also place us steel producers at a competitive disadvantage with respect to foreign steel producers which may not be required to undertake equivalent costs in their operations 

pursuant to the resource conservation and recovery act or rcra which governs the treatment handling and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes the united states environmental protection agency or us epa and authorized state environmental agencies conduct inspections of rcra regulated facilities to identify areas where there may have been releases of solid or hazardous constituents into the environment and require the facilities to take corrective action to remediate any such releases rcra also allows citizens to bring certain suits against regulated facilities for potential damages and clean up our steelmaking facilities are subject to rcra our manufacturing operations produce various byproducts some of which for example electric arc furnace or eaf dust are categorized as industrial or hazardous waste requiring special handling for disposal or for the recovery of metallics we collect such coproducts in approved baghouses and other facilities but we are also examining alternative reclamation technologies to recycle some of these products while we cannot predict the future actions of the regulators or other interested parties the potential exists for required corrective action at these facilities the costs of which could be substantial 

under the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act or cercla the us epa and in some instances private parties have the authority to impose joint and several liability for the remediation of contaminated properties upon generators of waste current and 

former site owners and operators transporters and other potentially responsible parties regardless of fault or the legality of the original disposal activity many states including indiana have statutes and regulatory authorities similar to cercla and to the us epa we have a number of waste handling agreements with various contractors to properly dispose of our electric arc furnace dust and certain other waste products of steelmaking however we cannot assure you that even if there has been no fault by us we may not still be cited as a waste generator by reason of an environmental clean up at a site to which our waste products were transported 

in addition to rcra and cercla there are a number of other environmental health and safety laws and regulations that apply to our facilities and may affect our operations by way of example and not of limitation certain portions of the federal clean air act clean water act toxic substances control act oil pollution act safe drinking water act and emergency planning and community righttoknow act as well as state and local laws and regulations implemented by the regulatory agencies apply to our facilities operations many of these laws allow both the governments and citizens to bring certain suits against regulated facilities for alleged environmental violations finally any steelmaking company could be subject to certain toxic tort suits brought by citizens or other third parties alleging causes of action such as nuisance negligence trespass infliction of emotional distress or other claims alleging personal injury or property damage 

employees 

our work force consisted of 6650 full time employees at december 31 2008 of which approximately 10 were represented by collective bargaining agreements the largest group of unionized employees is at steel of west virginia the remaining unionized employees are located in 6 different omnisource metals recycling locations each of which has its own agreement we believe that our relationship with our employees is good

 item 1a risk factors 

  many factors could have an effect on our financial condition cash flows and results of operations we are subject to various risks resulting from changing economic environmental political industry business and financial conditions the factors described below represent our principal risks  

risks related to our industry 

our industry is affected by cyclical and global economic factors including the risk of a prolonged recession  

our financial results are substantially dependent upon overall economic conditions in the united states in europe and in asia a prolonged or a deepening recession in the united states or globally could substantially further decrease the demand for our products below already currently depressed levels and adversely affect our business many of our products are commodities subject to cyclical fluctuations in supply and demand in both metal consuming industries and in construction metals industries have historically been vulnerable to significant declines in consumption and product pricing during prolonged periods of economic downturn such as at present likewise the pace of construction activity has historically slowed significantly during economic downturns and is already at historically low levels today moreover many of our customers rely on access to credit to adequately fund their operations or to finance construction projects and the inability of our customers to access credit facilities has affected and may continue to adversely affect our business by reducing our sales increasing our exposure to uncollectible customer accounts and reducing our profitability 

our business supports cyclical industries such as commercial and government construction energy metals service center automotive petrochemical and original equipment manufacturing these industries may experience significant fluctuations in demand for our products based on economic conditions energy prices consumer demand and decisions by governments to either fund or not to fund infrastructure projects such as highways bridges schools energy plants and airports many of these factors are beyond our control as a result of the volatility in the industries we serve we may have difficulty increasing or maintaining our level of sales or profitability if the industries we serve continue to suffer a prolonged downturn then our business may be further adversely affected 

imports of steel into the united states have in the past adversely affected and may yet again adversely affect us steel prices which could impact our sales margins and profitability 

excessive imports of steel into the united states as a result of excess world supply have in recent years exerted and may again in the future exert downward pressure on us steel prices even at currently low levels and may reduce or may negatively affect our ability to increase our sales margins and profitability us steel producers compete with many foreign producers including those in china competition from foreign producers is typically strong and is periodically exacerbated by weakening of the economies of certain foreign steelmaking countries greater steel exports to the united states tend to occur at depressed prices when steel producing countries experience periods of economic difficulty decreased demand for steel products or excess capacity 

in addition we believe the downward pressure on and periodically depressed levels of us steel prices in some recent years have been further exacerbated by imports of steel involving dumping and subsidy abuses by foreign steel producers some foreign steel producers are owned controlled or subsidized by foreign governments as a result decisions by these producers with respect to their production sales and pricing are often influenced to a greater degree by political and economic policy considerations than by prevailing market conditions realities of the marketplace or consideration of profit or loss however while some tariffs and quotas are currently in effect for certain steel products imported from a number of countries that have been found to have been unfairly pricing steel imports 

to the us many of these are only shortlived when such tariffs or duties expire or if others are further relaxed or repealed or if relatively higher us steel prices enable foreign steelmakers to export their steel products to the united states even despite the presence of duties or tariffs the resurgence of substantial imports of foreign steel could create downward pressure on us steel prices 

chinas current steelmaking overcapacity coupled with a reduction or slowdown in chinas steel consumption could have a material adverse effect on domestic and global steel pricing and could result in increased steel imports into the united states 

a significant factor in the worldwide strengthening of steel pricing prior to the third quarter of 2008 was the explosive growth in chinese steel consumption which had until the past year or so vastly outpaced that countrys capacity to produce steel in sufficient quantity to serve its internal demand the shortage of chinese domestic steel supply resulted not only in heightened chinese demand for imported steel and other raw materials with a consequent upward spiral in worldwide steel pricing but also led to a rapid and significant expansion of steel production capacity in china that however in addition to the existence of a large amount of outdated inefficient and government subsidized production capacity has resulted in a situation in which chinas steel producing capacity currently substantially exceeds that countrys demand for certain steel products china became a net exporter of more than 40 million tons in 2007 therefore a combination of a slowdown in chinas economic growth rate and its consumption of steel coupled with its own expansion of steelmaking capacity has caused a reduction in and could result in a substantial further weakening of both domestic and global steel demand and steel pricing and should chinese steelmaking capacity further increase or its demand weaken china might not only remain a net exporter of steel but many asian and european steel producers whose steel output previously fed chinas steel import needs could find their way into the us market through increased steel imports thus either causing a erosion of margins or negatively impacting our ability to increase our prices 

the worldwide economic downturn and difficult conditions in the global capital and credit markets have affected and may continue to adversely affect our business and our industry as well as the industries of many of our customers and suppliers which are also cyclical in nature 

some of the markets in which our enduse customers participate such as the automotive consumer products original equipment and construction industries are cyclical in nature thus posing a risk to us which is beyond our control these markets are highly competitive to a large extent driven by enduse markets and may experience overcapacity all of which may affect demand for and pricing of our products 

recent declines in consumer and business confidence and spending together with severe reductions in the availability and cost of credit as well as volatility in the capital and credit markets have adversely affected the business and economic environment in which we operate and the profitability of our business we are exposed to risks associated with the creditworthiness of our key suppliers and customers in particular we are exposed to risks associated with the ongoing decline of the automotive consumer products original equipment manufacturing construction and housing markets these conditions have resulted in financial instability or other adverse effects at many of our suppliers and customers the consequences of such adverse effects could include the interruption of production at the facilities of our customers the reduction delay or cancellation of customer orders delays in or the inability of customers to obtain financing to purchase our products delays or interruptions of the supply of raw materials we purchase and bankruptcy of customers suppliers or other creditors any of these events may adversely affect our cash flow profitability and financial condition 

moreover the current worldwide financial crisis has reduced the availability of credit to fund or support the continuation and expansion of our customers business operations many lenders and institutional investors have reduced and in some cases ceased to provide funding to borrowers therefore continued disruption of the credit markets has affected and could continue to adversely affect our customers access to credit which supports the continuation and expansion of their businesses and could result in contract cancellations or suspensions payment delays or defaults by our customers 

volatility and major fluctuations in prices and limited availability of raw materials and energy including energy prices may constrain operating levels and reduce profit margins 

steel producers require large amounts of raw materials the principal raw materials being scrap metal and scrap substitute products such as pig iron or pelletized iron although our vertical integration into iron making through our iron dynamics operations and our ongoing mesabi nugget project and our entrance into the metals recycling business through our acquisition of omnisource corporation may enable us to be our own source for some of our metallics requirements we will still need to rely on other metallics and raw material suppliers as well as general industry supply conditions during 2008 alone prices for no 1 bundles a scrap commodity reached a high of 865 per ton and also fell to a low of 125 per ton the availability and prices of raw materials may also be negatively affected by new laws and regulations allocation by suppliers interruptions in production accidents or natural disasters changes in exchange rates worldwide price fluctuations and the availability and cost of transportation 

steel producers also consume large amounts of energy inasmuch as minimills melt steel scrap in electric arc furnaces and use natural gas to heat steel billets for rolling into finished products the prices for and availability of electricity natural gas oil and other energy resources are all subject to volatile market conditions often affected by weather conditions as well as political and economic factors beyond our control 

if prices for scrap and other raw materials and energy increase by a greater margin than corresponding price increases for the sale of our steel products we may not be able to recoup such cost increases from increases in the selling prices of steel products or our inability to pass on all or any substantial part of such cost increases through scrap or other surcharges or to provide for our customers needs because of the potential unavailability of key raw materials or other inputs may result in production curtailments or may otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations or prospects 

our level of production and our sales and earnings are subject to significant fluctuations as a result of the cyclical nature of the steel industry the scrap metal recycling industry and some of the industries we serve 

the steel manufacturing business and the scrap metal recycling business are both cyclical in nature and the price of the steel we make or the steel scrap we utilize to manufacture that steel may fluctuate significantly due to many factors beyond our control with our acquisition of omnisource a significant portion of our revenues and our operating results are now also dependent upon both ferrous and nonferrous scrap metal sales to other steel mills and foundries for use in their manufacturing operations the timing and magnitude of these price fluctuations are difficult to predict the sale of our manufactured steel products is directly affected by demand for our products in other cyclical industries such as the automotive oil and gas gas transmission residential and commercialindustrial construction commercial equipment rail transportation appliance agricultural and durable goods industries currently the domestic automotive industry which is a major consumer of new steel and a major generator of steel scrap is suffering from a prolonged and unprecedented downturn threatening their financial viability continued economic difficulties stagnant economies supplydemand imbalances and currency fluctuations in the united states or globally could further decrease the demand for our 

products or increase the amount of imports of steel into the united states which would decrease our sales margins and profitability we are also particularly sensitive to trends and events including strikes and labor unrest that may adversely impact these industries these industries are significant markets for our products and are themselves highly cyclical overall we believe that rapid substantial price changes should they continue to occur will not be to our industrys benefit our customer and supplier base would be impacted due to uncertainty as to future prices a reluctance to purchase inventory in the face of extreme price decreases or sell quickly during a period of rapid price increases would likely reduce our volume of business 

similarly but not necessarily paralleling the price fluctuations in the steel business the purchase prices for automobile bodies and various other grades of obsolete and industrial scrap as well as the selling prices for processed and recycled scrap metals we utilize in our own manufacturing process or we resell to others through our omnisource facilities are also currently and may continue to be highly volatile and beyond our control as a metals recycler we may attempt to respond to changing recycled metal selling prices by adjusting the scrap metal purchase prices we would pay but our ability to do this may be limited by competitive or other factors and this in turn could adversely affect our sales and profitability 

fluctuations in the value of the united states dollar relative to other currencies may adversely affect our business  

fluctuations in the value of the dollar can be expected to affect our business a strong us dollar makes imported metal products less expensive potentially resulting in more imports of steel products into the us by our foreign competitors while a weak us dollar may have the opposite impact on imports 

compliance with and changes in environmental and remediation requirements could result in substantially increased capital requirements and operating costs 

we are subject to comprehensive local state federal and international statutory and regulatory environmental requirements relating to among other things 

• the acceptance storage treatment handling and disposal of solid and hazardous waste • the discharge of materials into air • the management and treatment of wastewater and storm water • the remediation of soil and groundwater contamination • natural resource damages and • the protection of our employees health and safety compliance with environmental laws and regulations which affect both our steelmaking and our scrap processing operations is a significant factor in our business we must obtain and comply with environmental permits and licenses and failure to obtain or the violation of any permit or license if not remedied could result in substantial fines and penalties suspension of operations or the closure of a subject facility private parties might also bring claims against us for alleged property damage or personal injury resulting from the environmental impacts of our operations moreover legal requirements change frequently are subject to interpretation and have tended to become more stringent over time uncertainty regarding adequate pollution control levels testing and sampling procedures and new pollution control technology are factors that may increase our future compliance expenditures we are unable to predict the ultimate cost of future compliance with these requirements or their effect on our operations and we also cannot predict whether such costs can be passed on to 

customers through product price increases although we believe that we are in substantial compliance with all applicable laws and regulations the cost of complying with existing laws or regulations as currently interpreted or reinterpreted in the future or with future laws or regulations may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

our manufacturing and recycling operations produce significant amounts of byproducts some of which are handled as industrial waste or hazardous waste for example our mills generate electric arc furnace eaf dust which the united states environmental protection agency usepa and other regulatory authorities classify as hazardous waste eaf dust requires special handling recycling and disposal 

in addition the primary feed materials for the shredders operated by our scrap metal recycling facilities are automobile hulks and obsolete household appliances approximately 20 of the weight of an automobile hulk consists of unrecyclable material known as shredder fluff after the segregation of ferrous and saleable nonferrous metals shredder fluff remains we along with others in the recycling industry interpret federal regulations to require shredder fluff to meet certain criteria and pass a toxic leaching test to avoid classification as a hazardous waste we also endeavor to remove hazardous contaminants from the feed material prior to shredding as a result we believe the shredder fluff we generate is not normally considered or properly classified as hazardous waste however if laws or regulations the interpretation of the laws or regulations or testing methods change with regard to eaf dust or shredder fluff we may incur significant additional expenditures 

the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act cercla or superfund enables usepa and state agencies to recover from owners operators generators and transporters the cost of investigation and cleanup of sites which pose serious threats to the environment or public health in connection with cercla and analogous state laws we may be required to clean up contamination discovered at our sites including contamination that may have been caused by former owners or operators of the sites conduct additional cleanup at sites where we have already participated in remediation efforts or to take remediation action with regard to sites formerly used in connection with our operations 

in addition we may be required to pay for or to pay a portion of the costs of remediation at sites to which we sent hazardous wastes for disposal notwithstanding the original disposal activity accorded with all regulatory requirements pursuant to cercla a potentially responsible party can be held jointly and severally liable for all of the cleanup costs associated with a thirdparty disposal site in practice a liable party often splits the costs of cleanup with other potentially responsible parties omnisource has received notices from usepa state agencies and third parties that it has been identified as potentially responsible for the cost of investigating and cleaning up several thirdparty disposal sites in most cases may other parties are also named as potentially responsible parties based upon information currently available to us we do not believe the cost of remediation of these sites will have a material effect on our business 

because cercla can be imposed retroactively on shipments that occurred many years ago and because usepa and state agencies are still discovering sites that pose a threat to public health or the environment we can provide no assurance that we will not become liable in the future for significant costs associated with investigation and remediation of additional cercla waste sites 

cercla including the superfund recycling equity act of 1999 limits the exposure of scrap metal recyclers for sales of certain recyclable material under certain circumstances however the recycling defense is subject to conducting of reasonable care evaluations of current and potential consumers 

risks relating to our business 

our senior secured credit agreement contains and any future financing agreements may contain restrictive covenants that may limit our flexibility 

restrictions and covenants in our existing debt agreements including our senior secured credit agreement and any future financing agreements may impair our ability to finance future operations or capital needs or to engage in other business activities specifically these agreements restrict our ability to 

• incur additional indebtedness • pay dividends or make distributions with respect to our capital stock • repurchase or redeem capital stock • make some investments • create liens and enter into sale and leaseback transactions • make some capital expenditures • enter into transactions with affiliates or related persons • issue or sell stock of certain subsidiaries • sell or transfer assets and • participate in some joint ventures acquisitions or mergers a breach of any of the restrictions or covenants could cause a default under our senior secured credit agreement other debt or our senior notes a significant portion of our indebtedness then may become immediately due and payable if the default is not remedied 

we are exposed to risks associated with the current financial crisis  

financial markets in the us and abroad have experienced extreme disruption including severely diminished liquidity and credit availability resulting in volatilities in shortterm borrowing costs and more stringent borrowing terms recessionary conditions in the global economy threaten to cause further tightening of the credit markets more stringent lending standards and terms and higher volatility in interest rates these conditions may adversely affect our business in the future particularly if there is further deterioration in the world financial markets and major economies the current credit conditions may also adversely affect the business of our customers difficulties in obtaining capital may lead to the inability of some customers to obtain affordable financing to fund their operations resulting in lower demand for our products furthermore liquidity issues could impair the ability of those with whom we do business to satisfy their obligations to us 

should the recent constraints on access to credit continue for a prolonged period some of our customers may struggle or fail to meet their obligations especially if they in turn experience defaults or slow payment on receivables due from their customers a prolonged recession could result in our incurring bad debt costs in excess of our expectations and prior experience in certain markets consolidation together with higher metals and other commodity prices has resulted in an increased credit exposure being spread among fewer customers often without a corresponding strengthening of these customers financial status 

we may not have sufficient cash flow to make payments on our senior unsecured notes and our other debt 

as of december 31 2008 we had 265 billion of indebtedness which represented approximately 62 of our total consolidated capitalization including current maturities of longterm debt 

our ability to pay principal and interest on our senior unsecured notes and our other debt and to fund our planned capital expenditures depends on our future operating performance our future operating performance is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties that are often beyond our control including general economic conditions and financial competitive regulatory and environmental factors consequently we cannot assure you that we will have sufficient cash flow to meet our liquidity needs including making payments on our indebtedness 

if our cash flow and capital resources are insufficient to allow us to make scheduled payments on our notes or our other debt we may have to sell assets seek additional capital or restructure or refinance our debt we cannot assure you that the terms of our debt will allow for these alternative measures or that such measures would satisfy our scheduled debt service obligations 

if we cannot make scheduled payments on our debt 

• our debt holders could declare all outstanding principal and interest to be due and payable • the lenders under our senior secured credit agreement could terminate their commitments and commence foreclosure proceedings against our assets and • we could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation the amount of our indebtedness may limit our financial and operating flexibility for example it could 

• make it more difficult to satisfy our obligations with respect to our notes and our debt • limit our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital capital expenditures acquisitions or general corporate purposes • require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our notes andor our debt reducing our ability to use these funds for other purposes • limit our ability to adjust rapidly to changing market conditions and • increase our vulnerability to downturns in general economic conditions or in our business we may face significant price and other forms of competition from other steel producers and scrap processors which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operation or prospects 

the global markets in which steel companies and scrap processors conduct business are highly competitive and are becoming even more so due to the current global economic downturn and to consolidations in recent years in the steel industry and in the scrap industry increased competition could cause us to lose market share increase expenditures or reduce pricing any one of which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations or prospects the global steel industry has historically suffered from substantial overcapacity and excess capacity in some of our products will intensify price competition for such products the global demand for steel scrap has also recently decreased due to market conditions causing a decrease in the price of scrap metals a decrease in price could result in some scrap generators exiting the marketplace which could further decrease the availability of scrap this shortage in availability of scrap could have a material 

adverse effect on both our steelmaking and our metals recycling operations and thus on our business financial condition results of operations or prospects 

we may be unable to pass on increases in the cost of steel scrap and other raw materials to our customers which would reduce our earnings 

if from time to time we are unable to pass on higher steel scrap and other raw material costs to our customers we will be less profitable we may not be able to adjust our product prices especially in the shortterm to recover the costs of prolonged increases in scrap and other raw material prices our principal raw material is scrap metal derived primarily from junked automobiles industrial scrap railroad cars railroad track materials agricultural machinery and demolition scrap from obsolete structures containers and machines the prices for scrap are subject to market forces largely beyond our control including demand by us and international steel producers freight costs and speculation the prices for scrap have varied significantly may vary significantly in the future and do not necessarily fluctuate in tandem with the price of steel moreover some of our integrated steel producer competitors are not as dependent as we are on scrap as a part of their raw material melt mix which during periods of high scrap costs relative to the cost of blast furnace iron used by the integrated producers give them a raw material cost advantage over minimills in addition our operations require substantial amounts of other raw materials including various types of pig iron alloys refractories oxygen natural gas and electricity the price and availability of which are also subject to market conditions 

competition from other materials may have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations or prospects 

in many applications steel competes with other materials such as aluminum and plastics particularly in the automobile industry cement composites glass and wood additional substitutes for steel products could adversely affect future market prices and demand for steel products 

equipment downtime or shutdowns could adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations or prospects 

steel manufacturing processes are dependent on critical steelmaking equipment such as furnaces continuous casters rolling mills and electrical equipment such as transformers and this equipment may incur downtime as a result of unanticipated failures or other events such as fires or furnace breakdowns as well as other unusual and unplanned maintenance requirements our manufacturing plants have experienced and may in the future experience plant shutdowns or periods of reduced production as a result of such equipment failures or other events these disruptions could have an adverse effect on our operations customer service levels and financial results 

we may face risks associated with the implementation of our growth strategy 

our growth strategy subjects us to various risks as part of our growth strategy we may expand existing facilities build additional plants acquire other businesses and steel assets enter into joint ventures or form strategic alliances that we believe will complement our existing business these transactions will likely involve some or all of the following risks 

• the difficulty of competing for acquisitions and other growth opportunities with companies having materially greater financial resources than us • the inability to realize anticipated synergies or other benefits expected from an acquisition • the difficulty of integrating the acquired operations and personnel into our existing businesses 28 

• the potential disruption of ongoing businesses • the diversion of resources • the inability of management to maintain uniform standards controls procedures and policies • the difficulty of managing the growth of a larger company • the risk of entering markets in which we have little experience • the risk of becoming involved in labor commercial or regulatory disputes or litigation related to the new enterprise • the risk of becoming more highly leveraged • the risk of contractual or operational liability to other venture participants or to third parties as a result of our participation • the inability to work efficiently with joint venture or strategic alliance partners and • the difficulties of terminating joint ventures or strategic alliances these transactions might be required for us to remain competitive but we may not be able to complete any such transactions on favorable terms or obtain financing if necessary for such transactions on favorable terms future transactions may not improve our competitive position and business prospects as anticipated and if they do not our sales and earnings may be significantly reduced 

there are risks associated with the development and operation of new businesses or acquisitions 

on september 20 2007 we announced that we are moving forward with our mesabi nugget ironmaking project to construct the worlds first commercial ironmaking facility to use kobe steel companys itmk3® ironmaking process an undertaking involving an investment of approximately 265 million for the nugget facility and 165 million for the mining operation on october 26 2007 we completed the acquisition of omnisource one of the largest scrap processing brokerage and industrial scrap management companies in north america for a purchase price of approximately 11 billion and on june 9 2008 we acquired the remaining 75 equity interest in recycle south llc that we did not already own for an purchase price of 376 million 

the success of any future business or acquisition will depend substantially on our ability to manage the acquired operations successfully and to integrate them with our existing operations in an efficient and effective manner if we are unable to manage or integrate new operations successfully our financial results could suffer additional risks associated with acquisitions include the diversion of managements attention from other business concerns the potential loss of key employees and customers of the acquired companies the potential assumption of unknown liabilities the potential risk of increasing the amount of our outstanding indebtedness and the inherent risks in entering markets or lines of business in which we have limited or no prior experience 

technology operating and startup risks associated with our announced mesabi nugget project may prevent us from realizing the anticipated benefits and could result in a loss of our investment 

while we and certain other current and former joint venture partners built and operated a successful small scale pilot project in minnesota using kobe steels proprietary itmk3® ironmaking process to produce a cost effective iron nugget product which we plan to utilize as a scrap substitute feedstock in our steel making operations we have no assurance that the full scale commercial plant we recently announced in which we will be the dominant investor and owner will be successful although we believe that a fullscale commercial plant should be capable of consistently producing highquality 

iron nuggets in sufficient quantities and at a cost that will compare favorably with the cost of steel scrap and scrap substitute products including pig iron there can be no assurance that these expectations can be achieved we anticipate the capital costs of this project to be approximately 265 million for the nugget facility if we encounter cost overruns construction delays or systems or process difficulties during or after startup the anticipated capital costs could materially increase the expected operating cost benefits from the development of this iron nugget product could be diminished or lost and we could also lose our investment in the project moreover we may undertake certain ancillary ventures related to the ironmaking process such as the mining and concentrating of taconite ore a business in which we have no experience and that could entail substantial additional investment with no guarantees of success 

hedging transactions may expose us to loss or limit our potential gains  

our product lines and operations may expose us to risks associated with commodity prices interest rates and possible fluctuations in foreign currency exchange as part of our risk management program we may use financial instruments including commodity futures or forwards foreign currency exchange forward contracts and interest rate swaps while intended to reduce the effects of the fluctuations these transactions may also from time to time limit our potential gains or expose us to loss moreover should any of our counterparties to such transactions or the sponsors of the exchanges through which these transactions are offered fail to honor their obligations due to financial distress we would be exposed to potential losses or the inability to recover anticipated gains from these transactions 

we are subject to litigation which could adversely affect our profitability 

we are involved in various routine litigation matters including administrative proceedings regulatory proceedings governmental investigations environmental matters and commercial and construction contract disputes we were involved as the sole defendant in a february 1 2008 lawsuit by prime eagle group limited seeking damages in excess of 11 billion but on february 23 2008 pursuant to our motion to dismiss that action the united states district court for the northern district of indiana granted our motion to dismiss with prejudice and denied the plaintiffs the right to amend their complaint we are also involved as one of nine defendants in a september 12 2008 class action antitrust complaint by standard iron works and others involving alleged antitrust violations of section 1 of the sherman act we and the other defendants have filed a joint motion to dismiss these actions these lawsuits are described in more detail in item 3 legal proceedings of this report we are contesting and will continue to vigorously contest all these matters 

due to the uncertain nature of litigation we cannot predict the outcome of these matters these matters however could have a material adverse affect on our financial condition and profitability litigation is very costly and the costs associated with prosecuting and defending litigation matters could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and profitability although we are unable to estimate the dollar amount of exposure to loss if any in connection with many litigation matters we make accruals as warranted however the amounts that we may accrue from time to time could vary significantly from the amounts we actually pay due to inherent uncertainties and the inherent shortcomings of the estimation process the uncertainties involved in litigation and other factors

operations 

we are one of the largest steel producers in the united states based on an estimated annual steelmaking capability approaching six million tons with 2008 shipments from steel operations including galvanizing totaling 56 million tons pursuant to our acquisitions of omnisource corporation in october 2007 and recycle south in 2008 we are also now one of north americas largest scrap recycling companies with ferrous metals shipments of 56 million tons and nonferrous shipments of 9118 million pounds during 2008 

• steel operations steel operations include our flat roll division structural and rail division engineered bar products division roanoke bar division steel of west virginia swva and the techs operations these operations consist of minimills producing steel from steel scrap using electric arc furnaces continuous casting automated rolling mills and downstream finishing facilities steel operations accounted for 63 81 and 89 of the companys consolidated net sales during 2008 2007 and 2006 respectively the flat roll division accounted for 24 32 and 48 of our consolidated net sales during 2008 2007 and 2006 respectively this decreased concentration in steel operations and flat rolled products reflects our continued growth and escalating product diversification our flat roll division sells a broad range of hot rolled cold rolled and coated steel products including a large variety of specialty products such as light gauge hot rolled galvanized 

galvalume® and painted products our structural and rail division sells structural steel beams and pilings and is also designed to produce and sell a variety of standard and premiumgrade rail for the railroad industry our engineered bar products division primarily sells special bar quality and merchant bar quality rounds and roundcornered squares our roanoke bar division sells billets and merchant steel products including angles plain rounds flats and channels swva primarily sells merchant beams channels and specialty structural steel sections the techs was acquired in july 2007 and operates three galvanizing lines specializing in the galvanizing of specific types of flat rolled steels in nonautomotive applications our steel operations sell directly to end users and service centers these products are used in numerous industry sectors including the automotive construction commercial transportation and industrial machinery markets 

• metals recycling and ferrous resources operations metals recycling and ferrous resources operations include the revenues and expenses associated with our omnisource and recycle south locations in addition our iron dynamics idi facility is included in this segment as well as the impact related to the construction of the mesabi nugget ironmaking facility and future mining operations in hoyt lakes minnesota output from these operations is generally used as raw materials within our steel operations metals recycling and ferrous resources operations accounted for 31 and 9 of our consolidated net sales during 2008 and 2007 respectively • steel fabrication operations steel fabrication operations include our new millennium building systems plants located in the midwest and southeastern united states revenues from these plants are generated from the fabrication of trusses girders steel joists and steel decking used within the nonresidential construction industry steel fabrication operations accounted for 5 8 and 8 of our consolidated net sales during 2008 2007 and 2006 respectively acquisitions 

sturgis iron  metal on june 24 2008 we completed our acquisition of certain assets of sturgis iron  metal an operator of scrap collection and processing locations in indiana michigan and georgia the assets were purchased for approximately 434 million in cash through bankruptcy proceedings and are operated as a part of omnisource and reported in our metals recycling and ferrous resources segment we purchased the assets to continue our expansion of our metals recycling operations and have begun operating three of the ten acquired locations sturgis iron  metal operations represented less than 1 of segment total sales and gross margin during the period since its acquisition 

recycle south on june 9 2008 we completed our acquisition of recycle south one of the nations largest privatelyheld regional scrap metal recycling companies headquartered in spartanburg south carolina omnisource which already owned 25 of recycle south acquired the remaining 75 equity interest for a purchase price of approximately 3763 million we paid approximately 2366 million in cash including transaction costs and issued 3938000 shares of steel dynamics inc common stock valued at 1398 million in addition we assumed 1449 million of net debt of which approximately 1428 million was repaid upon the closing of the acquisition 

we purchased recycle south to expand our metals recycling business recycle south provides a significant presence in the southeastern united states through its 22 locations within north carolina south carolina and georgia recycle souths consolidated operating results have been reflected in our financial statements since june 9 2008 in the metals recycling and ferrous resources reporting segment recycle south operations are reflected in our financial statements from the effective date of the merger june 9 2008 through december 31 2008 the addition of recycle south added shipments of 830000 tons of ferrous metals and 807 million pounds of nonferrous materials to the metals recycling 

and ferrous resources segment during 2008 net sales during the period were 4741 million or 13 of the segment annual total and gross margin was 403 million or 17 of the segment annual total 

omnisource on october 26 2007 we completed our acquisition of 100 of the stock of omnisource a privately owned ferrous and nonferrous scrap processing and trading company we paid approximately 4491 million in cash including transaction costs and issued 194 million shares march 2008 twoforone stock split adjusted of our common stock with a value of approximately 4550 million in addition we assumed approximately 2106 million of debt which we repaid on the closing of the acquisition we have in the past and will continue in the future to purchase a portion of our raw material needs for the steel operations segment from omnisource 

we purchased omnisource to significantly expand our strategic expansion into the steel scrap and recycled metals sector omnisource primarily procures and processes an array of ferrous and nonferrous scrap materials and also provides brokerage and materials management services for these materials aside from the fact that scrap is the single largest cost component for our steelmaking operations the acquisition along with the acquisition of recycle south provides an entry for further profitable growth in a sector that is continuing to grow on a global basis omnisource employs approximately 2000 people in 50 facilities located in the eastern united states and canada 

omnisource operates as a whollyowned subsidiary of steel dynamics and continues to focus on the ferrous and nonferrous scrap processing brokerage and industrial scrap management needs of its customers omnisource operations are reported in our metals recycling and ferrous resources operating segment omnisource operating results are reflected in our financial statements from the effective date of the merger october 26 2007 through december 31 2008 

the techs on july 2 2007 we purchased the techs for approximately 3734 million which was funded from our existing senior secured revolving credit facility the techs is a pennsylvaniabased flat rolled steel galvanizing company which consists of three nonunion galvanizing facilities galvtech metaltech and nextech each facility specializes in the galvanizing of specific types of flat rolled steels in nonautomotive applications servicing a variety of customers in the hvac commercial construction and consumer goods markets about 97 of the techs sales are to customers in the eastern us and the midwest we purchased the techs to expand our marketshare in the valueadded steel coating business with the addition of the techs we have an annual estimated galvanizing capacity of approximately 2 million tons the techs complements our three existing galvanizing lines located in butler indiana and jeffersonville indiana the purchase of the techs allows us to access markets that require widths or gauges that our existing facilities can not currently supply the techs operations are reflected in our steel operations segment the techs operating results are reflected in our financial statements from the effective date of the merger july 2 2007 through december 31 2008 

income statement classifications 

net sales net sales from our operations are a factor of net tons shipped product mix and related pricing we charge premium prices for certain grades of steel product dimensions certain smaller volumes and for valueadded processing or coating of the steel products except for our steel fabrication operations segment we recognize revenue from sales and the allowance for estimated costs associated with returns from these sales at the time the title of the product is transferred to the customer provision is made for estimated product returns and customer claims based on estimates and actual historical experience net sales from steel fabrication are recognized from construction contracts utilizing a percentageofcompletion method which is based on the percentage of steel consumed to date as compared to the estimated total steel required for each contract 

costs of goods sold our costs of goods sold represent all direct and indirect costs associated with the manufacture of our products the principal elements of these costs for our steel operations are steel scrap and scrap substitutes alloys zinc natural gas argon direct and indirect labor and related 

benefits electricity oxygen electrodes depreciation materials and freight our metallic raw materials steel scrap and scrap substitutes represent the most significant single component of our costs of goods sold the primary costs related to our metals recycling and ferrous resources operations is the cost of raw materials freight costs and processing expenses 

selling general and administrative expenses selling general and administrative expenses consist of all costs associated with our sales finance and accounting and administrative departments these costs include among other items labor and benefits professional services insurance expense property taxes profitsharing and amortization of intangible assets 

interest expense net capitalized interest interest expense consists of interest associated with our senior credit facilities and other debt described in the notes to our financial statements net of capitalized interest costs that are related to construction expenditures during the construction period of material capital projects 

other income expense other income consists of interest income earned on our cash balances and any other nonoperating income activity including gains on certain shortterm investments and income from equity investments other expense consists of any nonoperating costs 

operating results 2008 vs 2007 

net income was 4634 million or 238 per diluted share during 2008 compared with 3946 million or 201 per diluted share during 2007 our gross margin percentage was 15 and 21 during 2008 and 2007 respectively the decrease in our gross margin percentage during 2008 was due primarily to the inclusion of the techs and omnisource in our 2008 financial results as well as recycle south during the second half of the year although the techs generally elicits higher selling values due to valueadded products the gross margin for the galvanized steels produced by the techs is lower than that of our other galvanizing lines due to the incremental cost of purchasing a steel coil to be coated versus producing that coil at cost as we do at our flat roll division omnisource and recycle south are primarily engaged in the collection and processing of ferrous and nonferrous materials for resale to steel producers brokers and other processors this type of business operates at lower margins than we have historically experienced as a steel producer 

gross profit during 2008 our net sales increased 37 billion or 84 to 81 billion while shipping volumes increased modestly during 2008 in our steel operations and steel fabrication operating segments due to the fullyear inclusion of the techs acquisition in 2008 our metals recycling and ferrous resources operating segment experienced a significant increase in volumes compared to 2007 because of the fullyear inclusion of omnisource operations as well as the acquisition of recycle south in june 2008 

—steel operations 



steel operations accounted for 63 81 and 89 of our consolidated net sales and 75 88 and 96 of our consolidated gross margin during 2008 2007 and 2006 respectively our flat roll division decreased shipments by 167000 tons or 7 and our structural and rail division decreased shipments by 80000 tons or 7 these divisions were negatively impacted in the late third quarter and fourth quarter of 2008 by the weak economy and dramatic decrease in steel scrap prices our engineered bar products division increased shipments by 20000 tons or 4 during this period as a result of increased demand for specialbarquality products and the continued development of longerterm customer supply relationships in 2008 our roanoke bar division and steel of west virginia shipped 530000 tons and 265000 tons respectively compared to 595000 tons and 284000 tons respectively during 2007 the techs operations increased shipments by 369000 tons due to the inclusion of a full year of operations during 2008 

average quarterly steel selling prices 

our 2008 average steel operations selling price per ton shipped increased 284 compared with 2007 during 2008 strong demand for our steel products during the first half of the year allowed us to increase our annual average selling price by more than 41 however throughout the late third quarter and fourth quarter of 2008 demand and selling prices for our steel products fell dramatically due to the weakening of the economy and a swift decline in steel scrap costs we currently anticipate a substantial decrease in our steel operations average pricing in 2009 compared to 2008 due to the continued weak economy and demand for our steel products 

metallic raw materials used in our electric arc furnaces represent our most significant manufacturing cost our metallic raw material cost per net ton consumed in our steel operations increased 164 during 2008 as compared to 2007 during 2008 and 2007 our metallic raw material costs represented 63 and 50 of our steel operations manufacturing costs excluding the operations of the techs which purchases rather than produces the steel it further processes during the fourth quarter of 2008 our steel operations costs of goods sold included approximately 26 million in increased costs in order to value our inventories at market value which was below our cost we anticipate steel scrap prices to remain relatively low during 2009 which when combined with the revaluation of our inventories at the end of 2008 and the consumption of previously purchased higherpriced steel scrap should result in a lowercost posture entering 2009 

—steel fabrication operations 

steel fabrication operations accounted for 5 8 and 8 of our consolidated net sales and 4 7 and 5 of our consolidated gross margin during 2008 2007 and 2006 respectively our average steel fabrication operations selling price per ton shipped increased 5 or less than 1 during 2008 when compared with 2007 the purchase of various steel products is the largest single cost of production for our steel fabrication operations during 2008 and 2007 respectively the cost of steel products purchased represented 79 and 67 of the total cost of manufacturing for our steel fabrication operations the weak economy and decreased activity in nonresidential construction had a negative impact on this operating segment during the latter half of 2008 we anticipate nonresidential construction to remain slow during 2009 resulting in decreased shipping volumes and selling prices for this segment of our operations compared to 2008 

average quarterly fabrication selling prices 

—metals recycling and ferrous resources operations 

metals recycling and ferrous resources operations accounted for 31 and 9 of our consolidated net sales and 22 and 5 of our consolidated gross margin during 2008 and 2007 respectively our metals recycling operations primarily engage in the brokerage collection and processing of ferrous and nonferrous metals for resale to steel companies brokers and other metals processors we acquired omnisource in october 2007 and recycle south in june 2008 therefore our 2008 segment results are significantly higher than our results for 2007 during 2008 this segment recorded shipments of 56 million tons of ferrous metals and 9118 million pounds of nonferrous materials in addition 256000 tons of scrap substitute materials were shipped to and consumed by our steel operations segment 

the results of the metals recycling and ferrous resources operations include the consolidated results of recycle south beginning june 9 2008 and omnisource beginning october 26 2007 

elevated global demand for commodity products including ferrous and nonferrous materials in addition to decreased availability of domestic ferrous materials due to the decrease in industrial generation of ferrous scrap drove a tightening of availability and unprecedented cost increases for 

ferrous materials during the first half of 2008 however global demand precipitated a sharp decline in ferrous and nonferrous material costs at the end of the third quarter and throughout the fourth quarter of 2008 during the fourth quarter of 2008 our metals recycling operations costs of goods sold included approximately 10 million in increased costs due to reduction in inventory values that were recorded at a cost level which was higher than current market values we anticipate ferrous and nonferrous material costs will most likely remain relatively stable during 2009 

consolidated results 2008 vs 2007 

selling general and administrative expenses selling general and administrative expenses including profit sharing and amortization expenses were 3760 million during 2008 as compared to 2245 million during 2007 an increase of 1515 million or 67 our selling general and administrative expenses represented 5 of our total net sales during both 2008 and 2007 

we recorded expense of 617 million and 502 million during 2008 and 2007 respectively related to our steel dynamics performancebased profit sharing plan allocation during 2008 the companys board of directors modified the contribution percentage for this plan to consist of 2 of consolidated pretax earnings plus a unique percentage of each of the companys operating segments pretax earnings the resulting total contribution percentage was 83 of consolidated pretax earnings during 2008 the plan allocation was calculated on 80 of pretax earnings during 2007 during 2008 and 2007 respectively we recorded additional profit sharing expense of 53 million and 83 million related to certain subsidiaries whose employees did not participate in the aforementioned plan 

amortization expense increased 294 million or 245 during 2008 compared to 2007 this increase reflects the addition of finitelived intangible assets related to the acquisitions of omnisource and recycle south in october 2007 and june 2008 respectively the recycle south valuation of finitelived intangibles is still preliminary which could cause a change in the amount of amortization on a go forward basis 

interest expense net capitalized interest during 2008 gross interest expense increased 933 million or 135 to 1624 million and capitalized interest increased 41 million to 178 million when compared to 2007 this increase in interest expense was due to increased debt levels of 621 million the interest capitalization that occurred during these periods resulted from the interest required to be capitalized with respect to construction activities at our various operating segments we currently anticipate gross interest expense to remain somewhat comparable for 2009 

other income net other expense other income was 331 million during 2008 as compared to other expense of 55 million during 2007 during 2008 other income of 202 million was attributable to earnings from investments in scrap procurement and processing entities which were accounted for under the equity method of accounting as of the date of its acquisition recycle south which was 204 million of other income during 2008 is no longer included in these earnings as its results are consolidated in our financial statements after acquisition in addition we also realized gains on sales of marketable securities during 2008 of 86 million during 2007 other income was offset by 71 million of expense related to the call premium associated with the redemption of our 9 1  2  notes and the termination of a related fixedtofloating interest rate swap which resulted in a 50 million loss on hedging activities 

income taxes during 2008 our income tax provision was 2804 million as compared to 2357 million during 2007 our effective income tax rate was 377 and 374 during 2008 and 2007 respectively we account for income taxes and the related accounts under the liability method deferred tax liabilities and assets are determined based on the difference between the financial 

statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted rates expected to be in effect during the year in which the basis differences reverse 

included in the balance of unrecognized tax benefits at december 31 2008 are potential benefits of 385 million that if recognized would affect the effective tax rate we recognize interest and penalties related to our tax contingencies on a netoftax basis in income tax expense during 2008 we recognized interest of 778000 net of tax and penalties of 187000 at december 31 2008 we had 70 million accrued for the payment of interest and penalties 

we file income tax returns in the us federal jurisdiction as well as income tax returns in various state jurisdictions the internal revenue service irs completed an examination of our federal income tax returns for 1997 through 2001 in the third quarter of 2007 the final examination adjustments did not result in a material change to the companys financial position or results of operations the state of indiana completed its examination of the calendar years 2000 through 2005 in the third quarter of 2008 the total tax paid to settle the examinations was 207 million this amount was included in the balance of the unrecognized tax benefits recorded when we adopted fin 48 on january 1 2007 it is reasonably possible that the amount of unrecognized tax benefits could change in the next twelve months as a result of state income tax audits based on the current audits in process the payment of taxes as a result of audit settlements could be in an amount from zero to 20 million by the end of 2009 primarily related to state nexus issues with few exceptions we are no longer subject to federal state and local income tax examinations by tax authorities for years ended before 2005 

consolidated results 2007 vs 2006 

net income was 3946 million or 201 per diluted share during 2007 compared with 3967 million or 189 per diluted share during 2006 our gross margin percentage was 21 and 26 during 2007 and 2006 respectively the decrease in our gross margin percentage during 2007 was due to several factors primarily weaker flat roll steel markets and the acquisition of the techs and omnisource although the techs generally elicits higher selling values due to valueadded products the gross margin for the galvanized steels produced by the techs is lower than that of our other galvanizing lines due to the incremental cost of purchasing a steel coil to be coated versus producing that coil at cost as we do at our flat roll division omnisource is primarily engaged in the collection and processing of ferrous and nonferrous materials for resale to steel producers brokers and other processors this type of business operates at lower margins than we have historically experienced as a steel producer 

gross profit during 2007 our net sales increased 11 billion or 35 to 44 billion while our consolidated shipments increased 15 million tons or 32 to 62 million tons when compared with 2006 the increase in shipments was due to increased shipments at several of our steelmaking operations and to shipments from our acquired operations the techs and omnisource our flat roll division decreased shipments by 46000 tons or 2 our structural and rail division increased shipments by 156000 tons or 15 which resulted from increased demand for structural products for the nonresidential construction industry our engineered bar products division increased shipments by 44000 tons or 9 during this period as a result of increased demand for specialbarquality products and the continued development of longerterm customer supply relationships in 2007 our roanoke bar division and steel of west virginia shipped 595000 tons and 284000 tons respectively for the full year compared to 458000 tons and 237000 tons respectively for the period april 12 2006 to december 31 2006 

our 2007 average steel operations selling price per ton shipped increased 33 compared with 2006 during 2007 strong demand for structural steel products allowed us to increase our annual 

average selling price by more than 16 while the inverse was true for our flat roll products due to weaker demand during 2007 and the overhang of inventories from the impact of lower priced inventory during the third and fourth quarters of 2006 our annual average selling price for flat roll products decreased by more than 6 however throughout the second half of 2007 steel service center inventories continued to decline and were at a twoyear low by the end of the year 

metallic raw materials used in our electric arc furnaces represent our most significant manufacturing cost our metallic raw material cost per net ton consumed in our steel operations increased 25 during 2007 as compared to 2006 during 2007 and 2006 our metallic raw material costs represented 50 and 54 of our steel operations manufacturing costs and 44 and 53 of our total consolidated manufacturing costs 

during april 2006 we purchased three additional joist manufacturing facilities which were included in the operations of our steel fabrication segment our average steel fabrication operations selling price per ton shipped increased 146 or 13 during 2007 when compared with 2006 the purchase of various steel products is the largest single cost of production for our fabrication operations during 2007 and 2006 respectively the cost of steel products purchased represented 67 and 69 of the total cost of manufacturing for our fabrication operations 

selling general and administrative expenses selling general and administrative expenses including profit sharing an amortization expenses were 2245 million during 2007 as compared to 1709 million during 2006 an increase of 536 million or 31 our selling general and administrative expenses represented 5 of our total net sales during both 2007 and 2006 during 2007 we incurred an expense of 23 million related to the writeoff of previously capitalized financing costs when we redeemed our 300 million 9 1  2  senior notes due 2009 9 1  2  notes 

we recorded expense of 502 million and 450 million during 2007 and 2006 respectively related to our steel dynamics performancebased profit sharing plan allocation which is currently calculated as 8 of pretax earnings during 2007 and 2006 respectively we recorded additional profit sharing expense of 83 million and 53 million related to certain subsidiaries whose employees did not participate in the aforementioned plan our board of directors approved an increase from 6 to 8 in the profit sharing rate effective august 1 2006 in recognition of the additional plan participants added as a result of acquisition activity 

interest expense net capitalized interest during 2007 gross interest expense increased 353 million or 105 to 691 million and capitalized interest increased 120 million to 137 million when compared to 2006 the interest capitalization that occurred during these periods resulted from the interest required to be capitalized with respect to construction activities at our steel operations and steel fabrication operations during 2007 interest expense was also reduced by 34 million related to the recognition of the remaining unamortized bond premium associated with the redemption of our 9 1  2  notes 

other income net other expense other expense was 55 million during 2007 as compared to other income of 45 million during 2006 during 2007 other expense was principally comprised of 71 million of additional expense related to the call premium associated with the redemption of our 9 1  2  notes and the termination of a related fixedtofloating interest rate swap which resulted in a 50 million loss on hedging activities these expenses were partially offset by interest income certain nonoperating revenues and income from certain equity investments during 2006 other income was principally comprised of certain nonoperating revenues recognized at several of the roanoke electric subsidiaries 

income taxes we adopted the provisions of fasb interpretation no 48 fin 48 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  an interpretation of fasb statement no 109 on january 1 2007 the 

implementation of fin 48 did not have a significant impact on our financial position or results of operations during 2007 our income tax provision was 2357 million as compared to 2348 million during 2006 our effective income tax rate was 374 and 372 during 2007 and 2006 respectively we account for income taxes and the related accounts under the liability method deferred tax liabilities and assets are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted rates expected to be in effect during the year in which the basis differences reverse 

liquidity and capital resources 

our business is capital intensive and requires substantial expenditures for among other things the purchase and maintenance of equipment used in our steelmaking and finishing operations and to remain in compliance with environmental laws our shortterm and longterm liquidity needs arise primarily from capital expenditures working capital requirements and principal and interest payments related to our outstanding indebtedness we have met these liquidity requirements with cash provided by operations equity longterm borrowings state and local grants and capital cost reimbursements 

working capital during 2008 our operational working capital position representing our cash invested in trade receivables and inventories less trade payables and accruals decreased 227 million to 9864 million compared to december 31 2007 trade receivables decreased 2112 million or 30 during 2008 to 5029 million of which more than 95 were current or less than 60 days past due our largest customer is an affiliated company heidtman steel which represented 10 and 6 of our outstanding trade receivables at december 31 2008 and 2007 respectively trade receivables declined substantially during the fourth quarter of 2008 due to a sharp decrease in shipping volumes and product prices the dollar value of our raw materials primarily steel scrap inventories increased by approximately 939 million during the year conversely the value of our finished goods inventories decreased by approximately 97 million over the same period during 2008 our total inventories increased 1188 million or 13 to 10 billion of this increase in total inventories 340 million was the result of the acquisition of recycle south the remaining increase during the year was driven primarily by the significant increase in the cost and volume of our steel scrap inventories at december 31 2008 our trade payables and general accruals decreased 696 million or 11 during 2008 this is a reflection of the slowdown in our production process during the fourth quarter of 2008 

capital expenditures during 2008 we invested 4125 million in property plant and equipment of which 1166 million related primarily to the addition of a second rolling mill and second caster at our structural and rail division 819 million related to omnisource operations and 1070 million related to construction at mesabi nugget our planned ironnugget manufacturing facility the remaining capital expenditures primarily represented improvement projects at our other facilities we believe these capital investments will benefit our net sales and related cash flows as each project develops 

capital resources and longterm debt during 2008 our total outstanding debt increased 6205 million to 27 billion our total longterm debt to capitalization ratio representing our longterm debt including current maturities divided by the sum of our longterm debt and our total stockholders equity was 62 and 57 at december 31 2008 and 2007 respectively at december 31 2008 there were outstanding borrowings of 3660 million under our 8740 million senior secured revolver and 5682 million outstanding under our term a loan both due july 2012 

the senior secured credit agreement contains financial covenants and other covenants that limit or restrict our ability to make capital expenditures incur indebtedness permit liens on property enter into transactions with affiliates make restricted payments or investments enter into mergers acquisitions or consolidations conduct asset sales pay dividends or distributions and enter into other 

specified transactions and activities our ability to borrow funds within the terms of the revolver is dependent upon our continued compliance with the financial covenants and other covenants contained in the senior secured credit agreement the financial covenants state that we must maintain at all times an interest coverage ratio of not less than 200100 and must maintain a total debt to consolidated lasttwelvemonths trailing ebitda earnings before interest taxes depreciation amortization and certain other noncash transaction adjustments as defined in the credit agreement ratio of not more than 500100 if the total debt to ebitda ratio exceeds 350100 then our ability to make restricted payments as defined in the credit agreement which includes cash dividends to stockholders and share purchases among other things is limited to 25 million per quarter we were in compliance with these covenants at december 31 2008 and believe we will remain in compliance during the next twelve months our interest coverage ratio was 705 and our total debt to ebitda ratios was 235 at december 31 2008 

during april 2008 we issued 500 million of 7 3  4  senior notes due 2016 7 3  4  notes the net proceeds from the 7 3  4  notes were used to repay amounts outstanding under our senior secured revolving credit facility and for general corporate purposes including the acquisition of recycle south as described in note 2 

during 2008 holders of our convertible subordinated 40 notes converted the remaining 373 million of the notes to steel dynamics common stock resulting in the issuance of 88 million shares of our treasury stock 

common stock purchases during 2008 we purchased 223 million shares of our common stock in open market trades at an average purchase price of 2250 per share as of december 31 2008 36 million shares remain authorized and available for purchase our board of directors authorized increases of 50 million 100 million and 50 million shares to our existing share repurchase program on july 29 2008 august 26 2008 and september 17 2008 respectively 

cash dividends we declared cash dividends of 752 million or 40 per share during 2008 556 million or 30 per share during 2007 and 478 million or 25 per share during 2006 we paid cash dividends of 713 million 556 million and 375 million during 2008 2007 and 2006 respectively our board of directors along with executive management approves the payment of dividends on a quarterly basis the determination to pay cash dividends in the future will be at the discretion of our board of directors after taking into account various factors including our financial condition results of operations outstanding indebtedness current and anticipated cash needs and growth plans in addition the terms of our senior secured revolving credit agreement and the indenture relating to our senior notes restrict the amount of cash dividends we can pay 

twoforone stock split our board of directors authorized a twoforone stock split effective for shareholders of record at the close of business on march 19 2008 and increased our authorized common shares from 200 million with a par value of 005 per common share to 900 million shares with the approval of shareholders on may 21 2008 with a par value of 0025 per common share all prior period share and per share amounts have been adjusted to reflect the stock split 

other our ability to meet our debt service obligations and reduce our total debt will depend upon our future performance which in turn will depend upon general economic financial and business conditions along with competition legislation and regulatory factors that are largely beyond our control in addition we cannot assure you that our operating results cash flow and capital resources will be sufficient for repayment of our indebtedness in the future we believe that based upon current levels of operations and anticipated growth cash flow from operations together with other available sources of funds including additional borrowings under our senior secured credit agreement will be 

adequate for the next two years for making required payments of principal and interest on our indebtedness funding working capital requirements and anticipated capital expenditures 

during 2009 we currently anticipate spending approximately 270 million on capital improvement projects at our existing facilities and on among others the following capital projects approximately 46 million in connection with the completion of a second caster at our structural and rail division 125 related to the mesabi nugget project 32 million in connection with various scrap processing projects and 67 million of various smaller individual projects at our existing operations these amounts do not include capital requirements that may arise from our involvement in new joint ventures or merger and acquisition activity that may occur throughout the year 

during 2008 we received benefits from state and local governments in the form of real estate and personal property tax abatements and credits of approximately 49 million based on our current abatements and incentive credits and utilizing our existing longlived asset structure we estimate the remaining annual effect on future operations to be approximately 90 million 19 million 17 million 16 million 650000 600000 and 430000 during the years 2009 through 2015 respectively 

contractual obligations and other longterm liabilities 

we have the following minimum commitments under contractual obligations including purchase obligations as defined by the us securities and exchange commission a purchase obligation is defined as an agreement to purchase goods or services that is enforceable and legally binding and that specifies all significant terms including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased fixed minimum or variable price provisions and the approximate timing of the transaction other longterm liabilities are defined as longterm liabilities that are reflected on our balance sheet under generally accepted accounting principles based on this definition the following table includes only those contracts which include fixed or minimum obligations it does not include normal purchases which are made in the ordinary course of business 

the following table provides aggregated information about outstanding contractual obligations and other longterm liabilities as of december 31 2008 dollars in thousands 



1 the longterm debt payment information presented above assumes that our senior unsecured notes remain outstanding until maturity refer to note 3 to the consolidated financial statements elsewhere in this report for additional information regarding our longterm debt 2009 amounts include 3660 million related to our senior secured revolver which does not mature until 2012 however is classified as a current maturity due to our intention to repay this balance as free cash flow allows 48 

2 the estimated interest payments shown above assume interest rates of 7 3  8  on our 700 million senior unsecured notes due october 2012 6 3  4  on our 500 million senior unsecured notes due april 2015 7 3  4  on our 500 million senior unsecured notes due april 2016 45 on our outstanding senior secured revolver and term a balances and 77 on our other fixed rate debt of approximately 162 million 3 purchase obligations include commitments we have for the purchase of natural gas and its transportation to be utilized within our production process these arrangements have take or pay or other similar commitment provisions we have fully utilized all such take or pay requirements during the past three years under these contracts 4 construction commitments relate to firm contracts we have with various vendors for the completion of certain construction projects at our various divisions at december 31 2008 5 other commitments principally relate to certain pension and deferred compensation plan obligations other matters 

inflation 

we believe that inflation has not had a material effect on our results of operations 

environmental and other contingencies 

we have incurred and in the future will continue to incur capital expenditures and operating expenses for matters relating to environmental control remediation monitoring and compliance during 2008 we incurred costs related to the monitoring and compliance of environmental matters in the amount of approximately 497 million and capital expenditures related to environmental compliance of approximately 16 million nearly 65 of the costs incurred during 2008 for monitoring and compliance were related to the normal transportation of certain types of waste produced in the steelmaking process in accordance with legal requirements we incurred combined environmental remediation costs of approximately 11 million at all of our facilities during 2008 we have an accrual of 40000 recorded as a contingency for environmental remediation related to our omnisource subsidiary we believe apart from our dependence on environmental construction and operating permits for our existing and proposed manufacturing facilities that compliance with current environmental laws and regulations is not likely to have a materially adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or liquidity however environmental laws and regulations have changed rapidly in recent years and we may become subject to more stringent environmental laws and regulations in the future 

recent accounting pronouncements and developments 

in note 1 to our consolidated financial statements we discuss new accounting policies adopted by steel dynamics during 2008 and the expected financial impact of accounting policies recently issued or proposed but not yet required to be adopted 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

managements discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america we review the accounting policies we use in reporting our financial results on a regular basis the preparation of these financial statements 

requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities we evaluate the appropriateness of these estimations and judgments on an ongoing basis we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources results may differ from these estimates due to actual outcomes being different from those on which we based our assumptions we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 

revenue recognition and allowance for doubtful accounts except for our steel fabrication operations segment we recognize revenues from sales and the allowance for estimated costs associated with returns from these sales when the title of the product transfers upon shipment provision is made for estimated product returns and customer claims based on estimates and actual historical experience if the historical data used in our estimates does not reflect future returns and claims trends additional provision may be necessary our steel fabrication operations segment recognizes revenues from construction contracts using a percentage of completion methodology based on steel tons used on completed units todate as a percentage of estimated total steel tons required by each contract steel fabrication operations accounted for 5 of our 2008 net sales 

we are exposed to credit risk in the event of nonpayment by our customers which are principally intermediate steel processors and service centers that sell our products to numerous industry sectors including the automotive construction commercial transportation and industrial machinery markets we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments based on known credit risks historical loss experience and current economic conditions affecting our customers we mitigate our exposure to credit risk by performing ongoing credit evaluations and taking further action when necessary such as requiring letters of credit or other security interests to support the receivable from our customer if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate resulting in the impairment of their ability to make payments additional allowance may be required 

inventories we record inventories at lower of cost or market cost is determined principally on a firstin firstout basis 

impairments of longlived tangible and finitelived intangible assets in accordance with the methodology described in fasb statement no 144 accounting for the impairment or disposal of longlived assets  we review longlived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable impairment losses are recorded on longlived assets used in operations when indicators of impairment are present and the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than the assets carrying amounts the impairment loss is measured by comparing the fair value of the asset to its carrying amount 

goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets at least once annually or when indicators of impairment exist we perform an impairment test for goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets as required by fasb statement no 142 goodwill and other intangible assets as amended 

goodwill is allocated to various reporting units which are generally one level below our operating segments we utilize a twostepped approach to measuring goodwill impairment the first step of the test determines if there is potential goodwill impairment in this step we compare the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying amount which includes goodwill the fair value of the reporting unit is determined by using an estimate of future cash flows and a riskadjusted discount rate to compute a 

net present value of future cash flows if the carrying amount exceeds the fair value we perform the second step of the test which measures the amount of impairment loss to be recorded if any in the second step we compare the carrying amount of the goodwill to the net fair value of the recognized and unrecognized assets and liabilities of the reporting unit if the implied fair value is less than the carrying value an impairment loss is recorded to the extent that the fair value of the goodwill is less than its carrying value 

our other indefinitelived intangible assets are related to trademarks acquired through various business combinations as follows as of december 31 2008 in thousands 



we test indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment through the comparison of the fair value of the specific intangible asset with its carrying amount the fair value of the intangible asset is determined by using an estimate of future cash flows attributable to the asset and a riskadjusted discount rate to compute a net present value of future cash flows if the fair value is less than the carrying value an impairment loss is recorded in an amount equal to the excess in carrying value 

deferred tax assets and liabilities we are required to estimate our income taxes as a part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements this requires us to estimate our actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatments of items for tax and accounting purposes these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities which are included within our consolidated balance sheet we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely we must establish a valuation allowance 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

market risk 

in the normal course of business we are exposed to interest rate changes our objectives in managing exposure to interest rate changes are to limit the impact of these rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower overall borrowing costs to achieve these objectives we primarily use interest rate swaps to manage net exposure to interest rate changes related to our portfolio of borrowings we generally maintain fixed rate debt as a percentage of our net debt between a minimum and maximum percentage a portion of our debt has an interest component that resets on a periodic basis to reflect current market conditions we have an interest rate swap agreement swap agreement with a notional amount of 185 million in order to mitigate interestrate volatility exposure associated with the cost of our senior secured credit facility the swap agreement is scheduled to terminate on october 28 2009 under the terms of the swap agreement we are entitled to receive on the 28 th of each month interest payments at a floatingrate based on the one month libor rate and we are obligated to make interest payments on the 28 th of each month at a fixed rate of 221 

the following table represents the principal cash repayments and related weightedaverage interest rates by maturity date for our longterm debt as of december 31 2008 in thousands 



commodity risk 

in the normal course of business we are exposed to the market risk and price fluctuations related to the sale of steel products and to the purchase of commodities used in our production process such as metallic raw materials electricity natural gas and alloys our risk strategy associated with product sales has generally been to obtain competitive prices for our products and to allow operating results to reflect market price movements dictated by supply and demand 

our risk strategy associated with the purchase of commodities utilized within our production process has generally been to make certain commitments with suppliers relating to future expected requirements for such commodities certain commitments contain provisions which require us to take or pay for specified quantities without regard to actual usage for periods of up to 23 months for physical commodity requirements and for up to 12 years for commodity transportation requirements 

our commitments for natural gas and its transportation with take or pay or other similar commitment provisions for the years ending december 31 are as follows in thousands 



we fully utilized all such take or pay requirements during the past three years under these contracts we believe that production requirements will be such that consumption of the products or services purchased under these commitments will occur in the normal production process we also purchase electricity consumed at our flat roll division pursuant to a contract which extends through december 2012 the contract designates 160 hours annually as interruptible service and establishes an agreed fixedrate energy charge per millkwh consumed for each year through the expiration of the agreement 

in our metals recycling operations we have certain fixed price contracts with various customers for future delivery of nonferrous metals our risk strategy has generally been to enter into base metal financial contracts with the goal to protect the profit margin within certain parameters that was contemplated when we entered into the transaction with the customer at december 31 2008 we had a cumulative unrealized loss primarily associated with these financial contracts of 384 million we expect the customer contracts to be fully consummated

competitive strengths 

we believe that the following are some of our competitive strengths 

one of the lowest cost producers in the united states stateoftheart facilities 

we believe that our facilities are among the lowestcost steel producing facilities in the united states our low operating costs are primarily a result of our efficient plant designs and operations our high productivity rate of approximately 03 man hours per hot band ton produced at our flat roll division’s minimill low ongoing maintenance cost requirements and strategic locations near sources of our primary raw material scrap steel and our customers 

experienced management team and unique corporate culture 

our senior management team is highly experienced and has a proven track record in the steel industry including pioneering the development of thinslab flat rolled technology their objectives are closely aligned with our stockholders through meaningful stock ownership positions and performancebased compensation programs our corporate culture is also unique for the steel industry we emphasize decentralized decision making and have established incentive compensation programs specifically designed 

to reward employee teams for their efforts towards enhancing productivity improving profitability and controlling costs 

diversified product mix 

our current products on a companywide basis include hot rolled cold rolled galvanized and painted sheet steel various structural steel beams and rails special bar quality steel various merchant steel products including beams angles flats and channels and steel joists and deck materials we plan to construct and operate a second structural rolling mill a paint line and the capability to produce galvalume® to further enrich our product mix this diversified mix of products enables us to access a broader range of enduser markets serve a broader customer base and mitigate our exposure to cyclical downturns in commodity grade flatrolled products or in any one product or enduser market 

strategic geographic locations 

the locations of our steelmaking facilities near sources of scrap materials and near our customer base allow us to realize freight savings for inbound scrap as well as for outbound steel products destined for our customers steel scrap and scrap substitutes represent the most significant component of our costs of manufacturing our minimills are located in the upper midwest and south eastern united states regions which we believe account for a majority of the total scrap produced in the united states our jeffersonville indiana galvanizing facility located on the ohio river also provides us with an expanded geographic reach to southern markets 

business strategy 

expand product offerings 

the completion of our structural and rail mill the completion of the paint line by our flat roll division our acquisitions of the pittsboro indiana bar mill and the jeffersonville indiana galvanizing facility as well as the expansions and upgrades of both facilities are important steps in pursuing our strategy of product line expansion the structural and rail division is strategically located to serve the upper midwest northeast and canadian markets which we believe are attractive and underserved markets our strategy to expand our flat rolled steel product offerings is to focus on the production of high valueadded light gauge products galvanized products and various coated products the margins on high valueadded products typically exceed those of the commodity grade and the number of producers that make them is more limited our engineered bar products division is likewise strategically located to costeffectively serve sbq markets we will continue to seek additional opportunities to further expand our range of high valueadded products through the expansion of existing facilities greenfield projects and acquisitions of other steel producers or steelmaking assets that may become available through the continuing consolidation of the domestic steel industry 

enter new geographic markets 

we may seek to enter new steel markets in strategic geographic locations that offer attractive growth opportunities the recent roanoke electric merger and greenfield expansion of our new millennium joist and deck business in lake city florida are examples of such activities 

continue to maintain low production costs 

we are focused on continuing to maintain one of the lowest operating cost structures in the north american steel industry based upon operating cost per ton we will continue to strive to optimize the use of our equipment enhance our productivity and explore new technologies to further improve our unit cost of production at each of our facilities 

foster entrepreneurial culture 

we intend to continue to foster our entrepreneurial corporate culture and emphasize decentralized decision making and responsibility while rewarding teamwork innovation and operating efficiency we will also continue to focus on maintaining the effectiveness of our incentivebased bonus plans that are designed to enhance overall productivity and align the interests of our management and employees with our stockholders

our business 

steel operations 

flat roll division 

our butler indiana minimill manufactures flat rolled hot rolled cold rolled and coated steel products it currently has an estimated annual capacity of 28 million tons we produced 25 million tons and 26 million tons at this facility during 2005 and 2006 respectively our products are characterized by high quality surface characteristics precise tolerances and light gauge in addition our minimill was one of the first us flat roll minimills to achieve iso 9002 and qs 9000 certifications we believe that these certifications have enabled us to serve a broader range of customers and endusers 

we have two twinshell electric arc furnaces which enable us to melt scrap in one vessel while tapping the other vessel and refilling it with scrap and scrap substitute to make it ready for the next heat this results in more heats and greater productivity per shift we have three ladle metallurgy stations two continuous thinslab casters which produce a twoinch slab and two tunnel furnaces our hot rolling mill which progressively reduces the slab in thickness consists of a sevenstand rolling mill capable of rolling sheet steel down to 10mm with excellent surface quality which enables us to access markets previously available only to more costly cold finished material 

we sell a portion of our hot band coil production directly to endusers or to intermediate steel processors or service centers where they may be pickled cold rolled annealed tempered galvanized or painted by those customers the rest of our hot band coil production is directed to our cold mill where we add value to this product through our own pickling cold rolling annealing tempering galvanizing and painting processes a portion of our cold rolled production is shipped to our jeffersonville indiana galvanizing facility 

our cold mill is located adjacent to our hot mill and produces products that require gauges properties or surface conditions that cannot be achieved in our hot mill 

from a central coil storage area our hot band coils will enter the cold mill and be processed through our continuous pickle line once pickled we can move our coils in one of three directions we can 1 ship pickled and oiled coils directly to customers from the continuous pickled line as finished product 2 galvanize coils on our hotrolled galvanizing line to be then sold as finished product or 3 process coils through our cold reversing mill one of only two twostand reversing cold rolling operations in the world coils that have been processed through our cold reversing mill are typically either galvanized at on our coldrolled galvanizing line or annealed cold rolled galvanized and annealed coils can either be sold as finished product or further processed through our onsite paint line 

our onsite paint line located adjacent to our cold mill has an estimated coating capacity of 240000 tons per year in gauges from 010 to 070 inches and in widths ranging from 36 to 64 inches the paint line receives material directly from our other processing lines and is capable of painting hot rolled galvanized coil cold rolled coil and cold rolled galvanized coil the line incorporates stateoftheart coil coating equipment with quick color change capability and online color matching we believe that we are the only mill in north america with an onsite paint line which we believe enables us to realize substantial savings in overhead maintenance engineering sales and marketing capital costs and infrastructure and eliminates the typical cost of transfer freight that a customer must otherwise pay to transport coils to other remote coating facilities 

our jeffersonville indiana cold rolled galvanizing facility which we purchased in march 2003 is located within the clark maritime centre on the ohio river the galvanizing line has an estimated capacity of between 300000 and 350000 tons per year and is capable of coating cold rolled steel in gauges from 008 to 045 inches and in widths between 24 and 60 inches this gauge range is lighter than that available from our butler facility and creates further expansion of our value added product offerings the galvanizing line was built in 1999 and is similar to the cold rolled galvanizing line at our butler mill we have announced plans to expand our offering of valueadded flatrolled steel products at our jeffersonville facility through the addition of three strategic capabilities we plan to invest approximately 40 million in plant and equipment in order to produce prepainted steel acryliccoated steel and 55 aluminumzinc alloy coated steel construction is expected to be completed during the second quarter of 2007 with operations commencing in the second half of 2007 the paint line will have an expected annual capacity of 190000 tons 

our butler cold mill provides our jeffersonville facility with cold rolled material the ohio river location of our jeffersonville facility also creates opportunities for market expansion into other geographic regions 

structural and rail division 

our columbia city indiana structural minimill is designed to have an annual production capacity of up to 11 million tons of structural steel beams pilings and other steel components for the construction transportation and industrial machinery markets as well as standard and premium grade rails for the railroad industry we produced 762000 tons and 10 million tons at this facility during 2005 and 2006 respectively our facility melts scrap and scrap substitutes in a singleshell electric arc furnace although we have a second singleshell furnace which currently provides us with backup melting capability and will be the source of the steel required by our new rolling mill project described below our continuous caster casts three strands expandable to four of various sized blooms and beam blanks in varying lengths of 17 to 48 feet we can transport the cast strands either directly through a reheat furnace to our advanced fourstand all reversing hot rolling mill or into a storage area for rolling at a later time in the hot rolling mill we can roll the product into either a structural steel product or a rail product 

during 2006 we announced the addition of a 200 million second rolling mill that will be located adjacent to the current structural mill this additional annual production capacity of approximately 600000 tons will allow us to produce a higher volume of rail products and add lighterweight structural shapes and merchant bars to our product offerings we plan to construct the facility throughout 2007 and anticipate steel shipments to begin during the first quarter of 2008 

for the production of rail products we fitted our caster with special molds and segments to cast 13” x 10” blooms required for rail production we are able to produce class i quality standard rail and we expect to receive customer orders for rail during 2007 we are capable of manufacturing highly desirable 240 and 320foot rail lengths which no one else produces in or imports into the us or canadian rail markets we have completed a railwelding facility during the first quarter of 2007 which we plan to use to weld our longer length rails to lengths of 1600 feet 

engineered bar products division 

we purchased our pittsboro indiana bar minimill in september 2002 and during 2004 completed our announced program to upgrade and retrofit the mill to produce a broad array of merchant bar quality mbq bars and reinforcing bar products as well as special bar quality sbq products the mill was originally constructed in 1997 as an sbq mill and as upgraded consists of a 100ton singleshell ac furnace a threestand continuous caster capable of casting both a 7”x7” billet and a 14”x10” bloom a reheat furnace and a rolling mill consisting of a roughing mill and intermediate mill as well as reducing and sizing blocks used in the production of sbq rounds sbq products are uniquely designed to be in motion and include such items as gears shafts and forgings the pittsboro facility can produce sbq rounds in sizes from 1½” to 9” and sbq round cornered squares in sizes from 2” to 8” 

during 2006 we constructed a bar finishing facility adjacent to the pittsboro mill and commenced operations during the second half of the year adding various downstream finishing operations for our sbq steel bars the facility has an estimated annual processing capacity of 160000 tons processing operations include turning polishing straightening chamfering precision sawcutting and heattreating capabilities in addition nondestructive testing services are available including eddy current flux leakage and ultrasonic inspection the additional processing capabilities provide essential processes and services that have been requested by sdi’s growing sbq customer base 

the pittsboro facility has an estimated annual production capacity of between 500000 and 600000 tons during 2005 and 2006 respectively we produced 378000 tons and 523000 tons at this facility of which substantially all of the production was sbq products and we expect to employ this facility primarily if not exclusively for the manufacture of sbq products 

roanoke bar division 

we acquired our roanoke virginia minimill in april 2006 pursuant to the roanoke electric merger the mill was originally constructed in the mid1950’s and went through several major upgrades and expansions during the past 50 years currently the mill consists of a primary 100ton electric arc furnace a fivestand continuous caster capable of casting up to a 6 inch square billet a reheat furnace and a rolling mill with automatic inline straightening shearing and bundling capabilities 

the roanoke mill has an estimated annual production capacity of between 450000 and 500000 tons of finished products while its annual melting capacity is 650000 tons from the effective date of the merger april 11 2006 through december 31 2006 the mill produced 330000 tons of various merchant shapes including angles plain rounds flats and channels of various lengths and sizes and produced 477000 tons of billets the excess steel billet production is sold to mills without sufficient melting capacities 

steel of west virginia 

we acquired our steel of west virginia minimill in april 2006 pursuant to the roanoke electric merger the facility in its current configuration dates back to the 1950’s although it has undergone significant modernizations and upgrades during the 1980’s and 1990’s the plant consists of two 70ton electric arc furnaces a three strand continuous caster capable of casting squares from 4”x4” to 8”x8” and rectangles from 5”x4” to 6”x9¾” two rolling mills and various types of fabrication equipment unlike most other minimills steel of west virginia frequently performs finishing operations on its products such as cutting to length additional straightening hold punching shot blasting welding and coating through this additional finishing we create custom finished products that are generally placed directly into our customers’ assembly operations steel of west virginia has fabrication facilities in huntington west virginia and memphis tennessee 

the steel of west virginia minimill has an estimated annual production capacity of 315000 tons of finished products from the effective date of the merger april 11 2006 through december 31 2006 the mill produced 192000 tons of various merchant and structural steel products the niche markets supplied with these productions include truck trailers industrial lift trucks guardrail posts manufactured housing mining and offhighway construction equipment 

fabrication operations 

new millennium building systems 

our fabrication operations consist of five production facilities located in butler indiana continental ohio florence south carolina lake city florida and salem virginia these facilities produce steel building components including steel joists girders and trusses our individual joist products include bowstring arched scissor doublepitched and singlepitched joists our butler and lake city plants also produce steel roof form and composite floor decking these products are sold to the nonresidential building components market our flat roll division and roanoke bar division supply a substantial portion of the steel utilized in these manufacturing operations 

our butler and lake city plants were part of new millennium building systems during the entire year of 2006 with original operations beginning in 2002 and 2005 respectively these two facilities produced 182000 tons of steel building components in 2006 our continental florence and salem plants were acquired in april 2006 pursuant to the roanoke electric merger from the effective date of the merger april 11 2006 through december 31 2006 these plants produced 62000 tons of steel building components we are currently investing between 50and 60 million in these plants to modernize the facilities and enhance product capabilities and efficiency we also plan to add the capability for steel deck manufacturing at our salem location we expect the renovations to be completed by mid2007 

steel scrap and scrap substitute operations 

iron dynamics steel scrap substitute facility 

historically the price of steel scrap as a commodity has tended to be volatile rising and falling with supply and demand and not always in lock step with or in proportion to the market price of new steel more recently and increasingly so during 2004 and into 2005 scrap costs accelerated to historic highs threatening one of the principal elements of the minimills’ traditional lower cost structure—the cost of its metallic raw material therefore having a lower cost alternative source of iron for a portion of a minimill’s melt mix if realizable would partially buffer the effects of high scrap prices and scrap price volatility with the growing proportion of electric furnace steelmaking both worldwide and domestically we believe that the benefits of developing a costeffective alternate iron source to augment scrap our primary raw material makes good economic sense in the long run 

since 1997 iron dynamics has worked to develop and commercialize a pioneering process of producing a form of iron that might serve as a lower cost substitute for a portion of the metallic raw material mix that goes into our electric arc furnaces to be melted into new steel direct reduced iron is a metallic product made from iron ore or iron ore “fines” that have been treated in a “direct reduction” furnace such as a rotary hearth furnace with either natural gas or coal to reduce the iron oxide to metallic iron the method selected by iron dynamics is one that uses coal as the reducing agent the direct reduced iron or dri is then compacted by briquetters to form hot briquetted iron or hbi which is stable and can be immediately used in our melting furnaces or stockpiled for later use liquid pig iron the ultimate end product intended to be produced by iron dynamics is a pure metal product produced by smelting the direct reduced iron in a submerged arc furnace we have used and plan to use all of iron dynamics’ hbi and liquid pig iron in our steelmaking operations 

since the plant’s initial startup in august 1999 we have made continuous process design and equipment modifications as we encountered various quality and consistency issues with this pioneering technology in connection with the liquid pig iron conversion process the direct reduced iron is first liquefied and the hot liquid pig iron is then transferred in ladles to the flat roll mill’s meltshop and combined with scrap steel in the mill’s electric arc furnaces during 2006 the iron dynamics facility produced 236000 tonnes of direct reduced iron of which 135000 tonnes were converted into hbi and 80000 tonnes were converted into liquid pig iron 

shredded products scrap processing locations 

we acquired two steel scrap processing sites located in rocky mount and montvale virginia during april 2006 pursuant to the roanoke electric merger these operations process steel scrap and other metals from wrecked or obsolete automobiles and other waste materials the steel scrap is used as a source of raw material for our roanoke bar division we sell the nonferrous metals to outside customers 

products and customers 

steel operations 

flat roll division 

products   our flat roll division produces hot rolled products that include a variety of high quality mild and medium carbon and high strength low alloy hot rolled bands in 40 inch to 62 inch widths and in thicknesses from 500 inch down to 043 inch we also produce an array of lighter gauge hotrolled products including high strength low alloy and medium carbon steels these products are suitable for automobile truck trailer and recreational vehicle parts and components mechanical and structural steel tubing gas and fluid transmission piping metal building systems rail cars ships barges and other marine equipment agricultural equipment and farm implements lawn garden and recreation equipment industrial machinery and shipping containers

we believe that our basic production hot band material has shape characteristics that exceed those of other thinslab flat roll minimills and compares favorably with those of the integrated mills in addition as a result of our lighter gauge hot rolling capabilities we are able to produce hot rolled galvanized and galvannealed steel products these products are capable of replacing products that have traditionally only been available as more costly cold rolled galvanized or cold rolled galvannealed steel 

we also produce hot rolled pickled and oiled hot rolled galvanized hot rolled galvannealed cold rolled galvanized cold rolled galvannealed and fully processed cold rolled sheet our paint line paints pickled and oiled hot rolled galvanized coil cold rolled coil and cold rolled galvanized coil in gauges from 010 to 070 inches and widths ranging from 36 inches to 64 inches this material is typically used in transportation products building products such as raised garage door panels heating and cooling products appliances furniture and lighting equipment 

customers   the following tables show information about the types of flat rolled products we sold and the types of customers we sold them to during the respective years

 

  

steel processors and service centers typically act as intermediaries between primary steel producers and the many enduser manufacturers that require further processing of hot bands the additional processing performed by the intermediate steel processors and service centers include pickling galvanizing cutting to length slitting to size leveling blanking shape correcting edge rolling shearing and stamping we expect that our intermediate steel processor and service center customers will remain an integral part of our customer base our flat roll division’s sales outside the continental united states accounted for only approximately 1 of the division’s net sales in 2006 

during 2006 we sold our products to approximately 188 customers during 2006 our largest three customers accounted for approximately 16 of our consolidated net sales heidtman steel products inc which is principally owned by one of our directors accounted for approximately 7 and 10 of our consolidated net sales in 2005 and 2006 respectively 

structural and rail division 

products   we have the capability to produce various structural steel products such as wide flange beams american standard beams miscellaneous beams “h” piling material sheet piling material american standard and miscellaneous channels bulb angles and “zee’s” the following listing shows each of our structural steel products and their intended markets

competition 

steel operations 

flat roll division 

our flat roll division’s hot rolled products compete with many north american integrated hot rolled coil producers such as us steel’s plants near detroit michigan granite city illinois gary indiana dravosburg pennsylvania and fairfield alabama ak steel corporation’s plant in middletown ohio and mittal steel’s facilities in east chicago illinois riverdale illinois cleveland ohio and indiana harbor indiana burns harbor indiana and sparrow’s point maryland steel dynamics’ hotrolled products also compete with the products of a number of hot rolled minimills such as nucor corporation’s plants in crawfordsville indiana hickman arkansas decatur alabama and berkeley south carolina gallatin steel company’s plant in ghent kentucky and north star bluescope steel’s plant in delta ohio our flatrolled products compete as well with companies that convert steel slabs into sheet steel such as duferco steel in farrell pennsylvania 

structural and rail division 

sales of structural steel products are sensitive to the level of construction activity which is in turn affected by such cyclical factors as general economic conditions interest rates inflation consumer spending and employment 

our structural steel products compete with a sizable number of electric arc furnace structural steelmakers some of which have cost structures and flexible management cultures similar to our own notable competitors include nucor steel in berkeley south carolina nucoryamato steel in blytheville arkansas and chaparral steel in midlothian texas and petersburg virginia there are also a number of smaller competitors including gerdau ameristeel in cartersville georgia and bayou steel in laplace louisiana the nucor minimills and the chaparral minimills have accounted for the greatest bulk of the tons produced in north america over the past three years we also believe however that both geography and product choice will play significant roles there are currently no other structural mills located in the midwest one of the largest structural steel consuming regions in the united states and we believe we can provide freightsaving and customer service benefits to service centers fabricators and manufacturers located in the region we also believe that most of canada’s structural steel consumption is located in canada’s eastern provinces closer to us than to either of our two largest competitors moreover we intend to provide a broad product mix focusing on the midrange and larger section served only by nucoryamato steel and chaparral from locations more remote than our minimill 

at present the rail market is principally served by two producers rocky mountain steel in pueblo colorado a division of oregon steel mills inc and mittal steel in steelton pennsylvania each of these producers has the capability to produce either standard or premium rail although neither is equipped to produce rail in 240foot or 320foot lengths we will also compete with products from a number of high quality integrated and electric furnace steel producers in europe and asia including british steel voestalpine schienen nippon steel and nkk 

engineered bar products division 

our major competitors for sbq product sales within a 500 mile radius of pittsboro include republic engineered products of akron ohio the timken company of canton ohio quanexmacsteel in jackson michigan and monroe michigan and mittal steel usa in east chicago indiana

sources availability and cost of steel scrap and scrap substitute 

our principal raw material is scrap metal derived from among other sources “home scrap” generated internally at steel mills themselves industrial scrap generated as a byproduct of manufacturing and “obsolete” scrap such as automobiles appliances railroad cars and railroad track materials agricultural machinery and demolition scrap from obsolete structures containers and machines 

steel scrap 

scrap typically comprises approximately 8085 of the metallic melt mix in electric arc furnace steelmaking in contrast to integrated mill steelmaking where the proportion of scrap has traditionally been approximately 20 depending upon the scrap substitute material that may be available from time to time and the relative cost of such material the percentage of scrap used in our steelmaking operations could be reduced to the range of 60 or less of our metallic melt mix 

many variables can impact scrap prices all of which reflect the pushes and pulls of the supply demand equation these factors include the level of us new steel production for high quality low residual scrap is a byproduct of new steel manufacturing activity the level of exports of scrap from the united states the amount of obsolete scrap production and the effect of speculation on the amount of scrap offered on the market from time to time generally as domestic steel demand increases so does scrap demand and resulting scrap prices the reverse is also normally but not always true with scrap prices following steel prices downward where supply exceeds demand 

we believe that the demand for low residual scrap will continue to rise more rapidly than the supply in the coming years especially with the increased number of electric arc furnace minimills both here and abroad that have been built or commenced operations in recent years and especially due to foreign scrap demand 

as a result in order to maintain an available supply of scrap at competitive market prices we have established and intend to maintain multiple strong and dependable sources through which to competitively purchase scrap of all grades including low residual scrap have added our own inhouse scrap purchasing department may establish our own or may joint venture with others to develop additional scrap processing facilities and have been active in developing our own sources of scrap substitute products such as iron dynamics and our mesabi nugget project 

scrap substitutes 

direct reduced iron hot briquetted iron and pig iron can substitute for a limited portion of the steel scrap used in electric furnace minimill steel production during 2006 we used between 15 and 20 by weight of scrap substitutes in our melt mix mainly imported pig iron during 2006 we consumed 55 million tons of metallics that we melted in our electric arc furnaces iron dynamics shipped 217000 

tonnes or 239000 tons of scrap substitutes to our steelmaking facilities during 2006 all purchases of scrap substitutes were made on the spot market at prevailing market prices 

we anticipate that we will continue to utilize all of iron dynamics’ scrap substitute product output whether hbi or liquid pig iron 

markets 

flat roll steel 

flat rolled products represent the largest portion of the domestic steel market flat rolled products consist of hot rolled cold rolled and coated steel 

the following table shows the us shipments of flat rolled steel in net tons of hot rolled cold rolled and coated products as reported by the american iron and steel institute or aisi for the five years from 2001 through 2005 

 

1   includes pipetube sheet strip and plate in coils

2   includes blackplate sheet strip and electrical

3   includes tin coated hot dipped galvanized electrogalvanized and all other metallic coated

hot rolled products 

all flat rolled steel is initially hot rolled hotrolled steel is minimally processed steel coil that is used in the manufacture of various nonsurface critical applications such as automobile suspension arms frames wheels and other unexposed parts in auto and truck bodies agricultural equipment construction products machinery tubing pipe tools lawn care products and guard rails 

cold rolled products 

cold rolled steel is hot rolled steel that has been further processed through a pickler and then successively passed through a rolling mill without reheating until the desired gauge or thickness and other physical properties have been achieved cold rolling reduces gauge and hardens the steel and when further processed through an annealing furnace and a temper mill improves uniformity ductility and formability cold rolling can also impart various surface finishes and textures cold rolled steel is used in exposed steel applications that demand higher surface quality or finish such as exposed automobile and appliance panels as a result of higher processing costs cold rolled prices are typically higher than hot rolled prices cold rolled material is often coated or painted 

coated products 

hot rolled or cold rolled steel can be coated with zinc to render it corrosionresistant and to improve its paintability galvanized galvannealed galvalume electrogalvanized and aluminized products are 

types of coated steels these are also the highest valueadded sheet products because they require the greatest degree of processing and tend to have the strictest quality requirements coated steel is used in high volume applications such as automobiles household appliances roofing and siding heating and air conditioning equipment air ducts switch boxes chimney flues awnings garbage cans and food containers 

structural steel 

according to the steel manufacturers association in 2004 2005 and 2006 structural steel consumption was approximately 68 million tons 74 million tons and 87 million tons respectively consumption of structural steel products is influenced both by new construction and manufacturing activity and by the selection of steel over alternative structural or manufacturing materials 

rail 

according to aisi data domestic rail shipments averaged approximately 850000 tons over the 2003 to 2005 period including standard rail and premium or headhardened rail of the total shipments of rail during 2005 approximately 70 was produced by the two other us rail producers and approximately 30 was imported mainly from japan and europe there are currently no rail producers in canada 

sbq 

according to aisi data apparent sbq supply has averaged approximately 7 million tons nationally over the 2001 to 2005 period according to the aisi apparent supply of light structural shapes also characterized by a major dimension of less than 3 inches averaged between 1 million and 2 million tons annually during the 2001 to 2005 period 

energy resources 

electricity 

we have entered into a fixed price interruptible electricity supply agreement that extends through december 31 2007 for our flat roll minimill in butler indiana the contract allows our supplier to interrupt service in the event of an emergency or in response to various market conditions 

our other steel divisions purchase electricity at current market prices 

gas 

we purchase a portion of our steel operations’ natural gas requirements at market prices and a portion by entering into hedging transactions on the futures markets for ultimate physical delivery in order to help minimize price volatility 

patents and trademarks 

we have four registered trademarks containing the mark “sdi” and a chevron one trademark is the mark “sdi” and a chevron alone the second trademark is the mark “sdi” and a chevron and “steel dynamics inc” to the right of the chevron the third trademark is the mark “sdi” and a chevron and “steel dynamics” to the right of the chevron the fourth trademark is the mark “sdi” and an accompanying design of a steel coil and a chevron our iron dynamics division has filed five patent applications with the us patent and trademark office relating to its methods of producing low sulfur liquid pig iron as of the date of this filing we have received three of those patents 

research and development 

our research and development efforts have consisted of efforts to develop or improve our operating practices and our efforts to develop and improve alternative ironmaking technologies through iron dynamics and our investment in mesabi nugget with the exception of mesabi nugget most of these research and development efforts have been conducted in—house by steel dynamics’ officers and employees 

environmental matters 

our operations are subject to substantial and evolving local state and federal environmental health and safety laws and regulations concerning among other things emissions to the air discharges to surface and ground water and to sewer systems and the generation handling storage transportation treatment and disposal of toxic and hazardous substances in particular we are dependent upon both state and federal permits regulating discharges into the air or into the water in order to operate our facilities we believe that in all current respects our facilities are in material compliance with all provisions of federal and state laws concerning the environment and we do not currently believe that future compliance with such provisions will have a material adverse effect on our results of operations cash flows or financial condition 

since the level of enforcement of environmental laws and regulations or the nature of those laws that may be enacted from time to time are sometimes subject to changing social or political pressures our environmental capital expenditures and costs for environmental compliance may increase in the future in addition due to the possibility of unanticipated regulatory or other developments the amount and timing of future environmental expenditures may vary substantially from those currently anticipated the cost of current and future environmental compliance may also place us steel producers at a competitive disadvantage with respect to foreign steel producers which may not be required to undertake equivalent costs in their operations 

pursuant to the resource conservation and recovery act or rcra which governs the treatment handling and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes the united states environmental protection agency or us epa and authorized state environmental agencies conduct inspections of rcra regulated facilities to identify areas where there may have been releases of solid or hazardous constituents into the environment and require the facilities to take corrective action to remediate any such releases rcra also allows citizens to bring certain suits against regulated facilities for potential damages and clean up our steelmaking facilities are subject to rcra our manufacturing operations produce various byproducts some of which for example electric arc furnace or eaf dust are categorized as industrial or hazardous waste requiring special handling for disposal or for the recovery of metallics we collect such coproducts in approved baghouses and other facilities but we are also examining alternative reclamation technologies to recycle some of these products the iron dynamics scrap substitute process is an example of such an alternative while we cannot predict the future actions of the regulators or other interested parties the potential exists for required corrective action at these facilities the costs of which could be substantial 

under the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act or cercla the us epa and in some instances private parties have the authority to impose joint and several liability for the remediation of contaminated properties upon generators of waste current and former site owners and operators transporters and other potentially responsible parties regardless of fault or the legality of the original disposal activity many states including indiana have statutes and regulatory authorities similar to cercla and to the us epa we have a number of waste handling agreements with various contractors to properly dispose of our electric arc furnace dust and certain other waste products of steelmaking however we cannot assure you that even if there has been no fault by us we may not still be 

cited as a waste generator by reason of an environmental clean up at a site to which our waste products were transported 

in addition to rcra and cercla there are a number of other environmental health and safety laws and regulations that apply to our facilities and may affect our operations by way of example and not of limitation certain portions of the federal clean air act clean water act oil pollution act safe drinking water act and emergency planning and community righttoknow act as well as state and local laws and regulations implemented by the regulatory agencies apply to our facilities’ operations many of these laws allow both the governments and citizens to bring certain suits against regulated facilities for alleged environmental violations finally any steelmaking company could be subject to certain toxic tort suits brought by citizens or other third parties alleging causes of action such as nuisance negligence trespass infliction of emotional distress or other claims alleging personal injury or property damage 

employees 

our work force consisted of 3490 employees at december 31 2006 at december 31 2006 approximately 12 of our employees were represented by a collective bargaining agreement we believe that our relationship with our employees is good 




 item 1a   risk factors 

our profitability is subject to the risks described under this section on “risk factors” described below although the following are not necessarily the only ones facing our company our business financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected by any of the following risks 

risks related to our industry 

in recent years imports of steel into the united states have adversely affected and may yet again adversely affect us steel prices which would impact our sales margins and profitability 

excessive imports of steel into the united states as a result of excess world supply have in recent years exerted and may again in the future exert downward pressure on us steel prices and significantly reduce our sales margins and profitability us steel producers compete with many foreign producers competition from foreign producers is typically strong is periodically exacerbated by weakening of the economies of certain foreign steelmaking countries and is further intensified during periods when the us dollar is strong relative to foreign currencies greater steel exports to the united states tend to occur at depressed prices when steel producing countries experience periods of economic difficulty decreased demand for steel products or excess capacity 

in addition we believe the downward pressure on and periodically depressed levels of us steel prices in some recent years have been further exacerbated by imports of steel involving dumping and subsidy abuses by foreign steel producers some foreign steel producers are owned controlled or subsidized by foreign governments as a result decisions by these producers with respect to their production sales and pricing are often influenced to a greater degree by political and economic policy considerations than by prevailing market conditions realities of the marketplace or consideration of profit or loss however while some tariffs and quotas are currently in effect for certain steel products imported from a number of countries that have been found to have been unfairly pricing steel imports to the us the international trade commission in december 2006 for example as part of its five year review cycle of various steel import duties voted to revoke all tariffs and countervailing duties on carbon steel plate from 16 countries and voted to end tariffs on corrosion resistant galvanized steel sheet imported from canada france australia and japan when such tariffs or duties expire or if others are further relaxed or repealed or if relatively higher us steel prices enable foreign steelmakers to export their steel products 

to the united states even despite the presence of duties or tariffs the resurgence of substantial imports of foreign steel could again create downward pressure on us steel prices 

china’s current steelmaking overcapacity coupled with a reduction or slowdown in china’s steel consumption could have a material adverse effect on domestic and global steel pricing and could result in increased steel exports into the united states 

a significant factor in the worldwide strengthening of steel pricing over the past several years has been the explosive growth in chinese steel consumption which had until recently vastly outpaced that country’s capacity to produce steel in sufficient quantity to serve its internal demand particularly during 2004 the shortage of chinese domestic steel supply resulted not only in heightened chinese demand for imported steel and other raw materials with a consequent upward spiral in world wide steel pricing but also led to a rapid and significant expansion of steel production capacity in china that in addition to the existence of a large amount of outdated inefficient and government subsidized production capacity has resulted in a situation in which china’s steel producing capacity currently exceeds that country’s demand for certain steel products a combination of a slowdown in china’s economic growth rate and its consumption of steel coupled with its own expansion of steelmaking capacity has caused a reduction and could result in a substantial weakening of both domestic and global steel demand and steel pricing should chinese steelmaking capacity further increase or its demand weaken china might not only become a net exporter of steel but many asian and european steel producers whose steel output currently feeds china’s steel import needs could find their way into the us market through increased steel imports thus causing an erosion of margins and a reduction in pricing in fact in february 2007 the united states initiated legal action against china before the world trade organization alleging that chinese government subsidies and tax laws give chinese steel mills and unfair advantage and the european confederation of iron and steel industries is preparing to petition the european union commission to take antidumping action against chinese imports 

increases in prices and limited availability of raw materials and energy may constrain operation levels and reduce profit margins 

steel producers require large amounts of raw materials such as scrap steel producers also consume large amounts of energy over the last several years prices for raw materials and energy have increased significantly in many cases by a greater margin than corresponding price increases for the sale of steel products depending upon applicable raw material and energy prices over which we may have little control we and other steel producers may be faced in the future with difficulty in obtaining sufficient raw materials and energy in a timely manner or for reasonable costs resulting in potential production curtailments 

our level of production and our sales and earnings are subject to significant fluctuations as a result of the cyclical nature of the steel industry and the industries we serve particularly the auto industry 

the price of steel may fluctuate significantly due to many factors beyond our control this fluctuation directly affects our product mix production volumes and our sales and earnings the steel industry is highly cyclical and the sale of our products is directly affected by demand for our products in other highly cyclical industries such as the automotive oil and gas gas transmission residential and commercialindustrial construction commercial equipment rail transportation appliance agricultural and durable goods industries currently the domestic automotive industry which is a major consumer of new steel and a major generating of steel scrap is suffering from a substantial downturn and continued economic difficulties stagnant economies supplydemand imbalances and currency fluctuations in the united states or globally could further decrease the demand for our products or increase the amount of imports of steel into the united states which would decrease our sales margins and profitability we are 

also particularly sensitive to trends and events including strikes and labor unrest that may adversely impact these industries these industries are significant markets for our products and are themselves highly cyclical 

risks relating to our business 

our stock price may be volatile and could decline substantially 

our stock price may decline substantially as a result of the volatile nature of the stock market and other factors beyond its control many factors may cause the market price of our common stock to decline including 

·   the failure of operating results to meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors in any quarter

·   downward revisions in securities analysts’ estimates

·   consolidation by other competitors in the industry

·   material company or industry announcements by us or our competitors

·   market perceptions concerning the steel cycle and our future earnings prospects

·   public sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock

·   governmental regulatory action or

·   adverse changes in general market conditions or economic trends

shares eligible for public sale could adversely affect our stock price 

the future sale of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market or the perception that such sales could occur could significantly reduce our stock price it could also make it more difficult for us to raise funds through equity offerings in the future as of december 31 2006 we had 96983303 shares of our common stock outstanding this does not include the 4410573 shares of common stock that are issuable upon conversion of our 4 convertible subordinated notes due 2012 

in addition we have filed registration statements under the securities act to register shares of our common stock reserved for issuance under our stock option and management incentive plans thus permitting the resale of such shares by nonaffiliates upon issuance in the public market without restriction under the securities act as of december 31 2006 options to purchase 2183721 shares were outstanding under these stock option plans 

we may not continue to pay cash dividends in the future 

from the time of our initial public offering in 1996 through the second quarter of 2004 we did not declare or pay cash or other dividends on our common stock we declared and paid aggregate cash dividends of 125 twelve and onehalf cents per share and 20 twenty cents per share for 2004 and 2005 respectively we declared and paid cash dividends of 10 ten cents per share for each of the first and second quarters of 2006 and 15 fifteen cents per share for each of the third and fourth quarters of 2006 we cannot assure you that we will continue to pay cash dividends or if we do that we will do so at the current rate we may elect at any time to retain all future earnings for use in the operation of our business and to fund future growth moreover the terms of our senior secured credit agreement and the indenture relating to our senior notes impose specified restrictions on our ability to pay cash dividends even if these restrictions are removed any future cash dividends will depend our results of operations financial conditions cash requirements the availability of a surplus and other factors 

we may encounter supply shortages and increases in the cost of raw materials energy and transportation 

steel production requires substantial amounts of raw materials and energy including steel scrap pig iron iron ore fines natural gas coal and other alloys or materials used in the process of making steel any prolonged interruption in the supply of raw materials or energy or substantial increases in their costs could adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations or prospects the availability and prices of raw materials has substantially increased over the past several years and may also continue to increase the availability and prices of raw materials may be negatively affected by new laws or regulations allocation by suppliers interruptions in production accidents or natural disasters changes in exchange rates worldwide price fluctuations and the availability and cost of transportation 

energy costs including the cost of natural gas and electricity make up a substantial portion of the cost of goods sold by steel companies and the price of natural gas and electricity varies as a result of market conditions and other factors beyond the control of steel companies moreover global developments particularly the dramatic increase in the demand for raw materials including scrap and other inputs used in steel manufacturing from china and other asian countries have in the past caused shortages and may continue to cause severe shortages andor substantial price increases in key raw materials as well as in ocean transportation capacity and costs inability to recoup such cost increases from increases in the selling prices of steel products or the inability to pass on all or any substantial part of such cost increases through scrap or other surcharges or the inability to provide customers’ needs because of the potential unavailability of key raw materials or other inputs may have a material adverse effect on steel dynamics’ business financial condition results of operations or prospects 

our senior secured credit agreement the indenture relating to our 9½ senior unsecured notes due 2009 and the indenture relating to our 4 convertible subordinated notes due 2012 contain restrictive covenants that may independently limit our flexibility 

restrictions and covenants in our existing debt agreements including our senior secured credit agreement the indenture relating to our 9½ senior unsecured notes due 2009 and the indenture relating to our 4 convertible subordinated notes due 2012 and any future financing agreements may impair our ability to finance future operations or capital needs or to engage in other business activities specifically these agreements restrict our ability to 

·   incur additional indebtedness

·   pay dividends or make distributions with respect to our capital stock

·   repurchase or redeem capital stock

·   make some investments

·   create liens and enter into sale and leaseback transactions

·   make some capital expenditures

·   enter into transactions with affiliates or related persons

·   issue or sell stock of certain subsidiaries

·   sell or transfer assets and

·   participate in some joint ventures acquisitions or mergers

a breach of any of the restrictions or covenants in one or more of these debt agreements could cause a default under our senior secured credit agreement other debt or the notes a significant portion of our indebtedness then may become immediately due and payable 

we may face significant price and other forms of competition from other steel producers which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operation or prospects 

the global markets in which steel companies conduct business are highly competitive and are becoming even more so due to increasing consolidation in the steel industry increased competition could cause us to lose market share increase expenditures or reduce pricing any one of which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations or prospects the global steel industry has historically suffered from substantial overcapacity and excess capacity in some of our products will intensify price competition for such products this could cause us to reduce the price for our products and as a result have a material adverse affect on our business financial condition results of operations or prospects we compete primarily on the basis of quality and the ability to meet our customers’ product needs delivery schedules and price and some of our competitors may have advantages due to greater capital resources different technologies lower raw material and energy costs or favorable exchange rates 

competition from other materials may have a material adverse affect on our business financial condition results of operations or prospects 

in many applications steel competes with other materials such as aluminum and plastics particularly in the automobile industry cement composites glass and wood additional substitutes for steel products could adversely affect future market prices and demand for steel products 

equipment downtime or shutdowns could adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations or prospects 

steel manufacturing processes are dependent on critical steelmaking equipment such as furnaces continuous casters rolling mills and electrical equipment such as transformers and this equipment may incur downtime as a result of unanticipated failures or other events such as fires or furnace breakdowns as well as other unusual and unplanned maintenance requirements our manufacturing plants have experienced and may in the future experience plant shutdowns or periods of reduced production as a result of such equipment failures or other events these disruptions could have an adverse affect on our operations customer service levels and financial results 

we may face risks associated with the implementation of our growth strategy 

our growth strategy subjects us to various risks as part of our growth strategy we may expand existing facilities build additional plants acquire other businesses and steel assets enter into joint ventures or form strategic alliances that we believe will complement our existing business these transactions will likely involve some or all of the following risks 

·   the difficulty of competing for acquisitions and other growth opportunities with companies having materially greater financial resources than us

·   the difficulty of integrating the acquired operations and personnel into existing businesses

·   the potential disruption of ongoing businesses

·   the diversion of resources

·   the inability of management to maintain uniform standards controls procedures and policies

·   the difficulty of managing the growth of a larger company

·   the risk of entering markets in which we have little experience

·   the risk of becoming involved in labor commercial or regulatory disputes or litigation related to the new enterprise

·   the risk of contractual or operational liability to other venture participants or to third parties as a result of our participation

·   the inability to work efficiently with joint venture or strategic alliance partners and

·   the difficulties of terminating joint ventures or strategic alliances

these transactions might be required for us to remain competitive but we may not be able to complete any such transactions on favorable terms or obtain financing if necessary for such transactions on favorable terms future transactions may not improve our competitive position and business prospects as anticipated and if they do not our sales and earnings may be significantly reduced 

there are risks associated with acquisitions 

the success of any future acquisition will depend substantially on our ability to integrate the acquired operations successfully with our existing operations in an efficient and effective manner if we are unable to integrate new operations successfully our financial results could suffer additional risks associated with acquisitions include the diversion of management’s attention from other business concerns the potential loss of key employees and customers of the acquired companies the potential assumption of unknown liabilities and the inherent risks in entering markets or lines of business in which we have limited or no prior experience 

environmental regulation imposes substantial costs and limitations on steel dynamics’ operations 

we are subject to the risk of substantial environmental liability and limitations on our operations brought about by the requirements of environmental laws and regulations we are subject to various federal state and local environmental health and safety laws and regulations concerning such issues as air emissions wastewater discharges solid and hazardous materials and waste handling and disposal and the investigation and remediation of contamination these laws and regulations are increasingly stringent while we believe that our facilities are and will continue to be in material compliance with all applicable environmental laws and regulations the risks of substantial costs and liabilities related to compliance with these laws and regulations are an inherent part of the business and it is possible that future conditions may develop arise or be discovered that create substantial environmental remediation liabilities and costs for example steelmaking operations produce some waste products such as electric arc furnace dust which are classified as hazardous waste and must be properly disposed of under applicable environmental laws these laws can impose clean up liability on generators of hazardous waste and other substances that are shipped offsite for disposal regardless of fault or the legality of the disposal activities other laws may require us to investigate and remediate contamination at its properties including contamination that was caused in whole or in part by third parties while we believe we can comply with environmental legislation and regulatory requirements and that the costs of doing so have been included within budgeted cost estimates it is possible that such compliance will prove to be more limiting and costly than anticipated in addition to potential clean up liability in the past we have been and in the future may become subject to substantial monetary fines and penalties for violation of applicable laws regulations or administrative conditions we may also be subject from time to time to legal proceedings brought by private parties or governmental agencies with respect to environmental matters including matters involving alleged property damage or personal injury 

technology operating and startup risks associated with our contemplated mesabi nugget project may prevent us from realizing the anticipated benefits and could result in a loss of our investment 

while we and certain other joint venture partners built and operated a successful small scale pilot project in minnesota using kobe steel’s proprietary itmk3’s ironmaking process to produce a cost effective iron nugget product we have no assurance that the full scale commercial plant we are know contemplating in which we would likely be the dominant investor and owner will be successful although we believe that a full scale commercial plant should be capable of consistently producing highquality iron nuggets in sufficient quantities and at a cost that will compare favorably with the cost of scrap and scrap substitute products including pig iron there can be no assurance that these expectations can be achieved if we proceed with this project which could entail an investment in excess of 100 million and if we thereafter encounter cost overruns construction delays or systems or process difficulties during or after startup the anticipated capital costs could materially increase the expected operating cost benefits from the development of this iron nugget product could be diminished or lost and we could also lose our investment in the project

operations 

we are one of the largest steel producers in the united states based on an estimated annual steelmaking capability of 52 million tons with 2006 shipments from steel operations totaling 48 million tons our 2006 consolidated shipments which exclude shipments between our operating divisions totaled 47 million tons our operations previously consisted of two reporting segments steel operations and steel scrap substitute operations however with the addition of three joist fabrication facilities acquired pursuant to the roanoke electric steel corporation roanoke electric merger in april 2006 we added a third reporting segment steel fabrication upon the addition of two steel scrap processing locations also in connection with the roanoke electric merger we changed the steel scrap substitute operations segment to steel scrap and scrap substitute operations 

·   steel operations steel operations include our flat roll division structural and rail division engineered bar products division roanoke bar division and swva operations these operations consist of minimills producing steel from steel scrap using electric arc furnaces continuous casting and automated rolling mills steel operations accounted for 89 91 and 93 of our consolidated net sales during 2006 2005 and 2004 respectively the flat roll division accounted for 48 60 and 66 of our consolidated net sales during 2006 2005 and 2004 respectively this decreased concentration in flat rolled steel reflects our growth and escalating product diversification through the continued increase of sales from the structural and rail and the engineered bar products divisions as well as through the addition of the roanoke bar division and swva operations pursuant to the roanoke electric merger

the flat roll division sells a broad range of hot rolled cold rolled and coated steel products including a large variety of specialty products such as light gauge hotrolled galvanized and painted products the structural and rail division sells structural steel beams and pilings and is also designed to produce and sell a variety of standard and premiumgrade rail for the railroad industry the engineered bar products division primarily sells special bar quality and merchant bar quality rounds and roundcornered squares the roanoke bar division sells billets and merchant steel products including angles plain rounds flats and channels swva primarily sells merchant beams channels and specialty structural steel sections our steel operations sell directly to end users and service centers these products are used in numerous industry sectors including the automotive construction commercial transportation and industrial machinery markets 

·   fabrication operations fabrication operations include our five new millennium building systems plants located in butler indiana lake city florida salem virginia florence south carolina and continental ohio the operations located in salem florence and continental were acquired in 2006 pursuant to the roanoke electric merger revenues from these plants are generated from the fabrication of trusses girders steel joists and steel decking used within the nonresidential construction industry fabrication operations accounted for 8 6 and 4 of our consolidated net sales during 2006 2005 and 2004 respectively

·   steel scrap and scrap substitute operations steel scrap and scrap substitute operations include the revenues and expenses associated with our two steel scrap processing locations acquired through the roanoke electric merger and from our scrap substitute manufacturing facility iron dynamics idi output from these operations is generally used as raw materials within our steel operations

roanoke electric merger 

we completed our merger with roanoke electric on april 11 2006 immediately following approval of the transaction by roanoke electric stockholders through the merger we have further diversified our product mix expanded our presence in the bar joist market and gained additional expertise and presence in the scrap processing business roanoke electric has steel manufacturing facilities in roanoke virginia and huntington west virginia these facilities produce angles rounds flats channels beams special sections and billets which are sold to steel service centers fabricators original equipment manufacturers and other steel producers roanoke also has certain subsidiaries involved in steel fabrication including bar joist and truck trailer beams and has two steel scrap processing locations 

pursuant to the merger agreement roanoke electric stockholders received 975 in cash and 08 shares of our common stock for each share of roanoke electric stock outstanding at the effective date of the merger based on 11360901 shares of roanoke electric stock outstanding prior to the close of the transaction we paid 1108 million in cash issued 91 million shares of registered steel dynamics common stock valued at 1277 million from our treasury stock reserves incurred 49 million in transaction costs and assumed 447 million in debt which we retired on april 12 2006 the cash portion of the purchase price was funded from cash on hand 

roanoke electric operating results are reflected in our financial statements from the effective date of the merger april 12 2006 through december 31 2006 

income statement classifications 

net sales   net sales from steel operations are a factor of net tons shipped product mix and related pricing net sales from steel fabrication are recognized from construction contracts utilizing a percentageofcompletion method which is based on the percentage of steel consumed todate as compared to the estimated total steel required for each contract steel fabrication revenues accounted for approximately 8 and 6 of our total net sales during 2006 and 2005 respectively our net sales are determined by subtracting product returns sales discounts return allowances and claims from total sales we charge 

premium prices for certain grades of steel product dimensions or certain smaller volumes and for valueadded processing or coating of steel products we also charge marginally higher prices for our valueadded products these products include hot rolled and cold rolled galvanized products cold rolled products and painted products from our flat roll division certain specialbarquality products from our engineered bar products division and certain industrial truck and trailer products from our steel of west virginia operations 

costs of goods sold   our costs of goods sold represent all direct and indirect costs associated with the manufacture of our products the principal elements of these costs are steel scrap and scrap substitutes alloys zinc natural gas argon direct and indirect labor and related benefits electricity oxygen electrodes depreciation materials and freight our metallic raw materials steel scrap and scrap substitutes represent the most significant component of our costs of goods sold

selling general and administrative expenses   selling general and administrative expenses consist of all costs associated with our sales finance and accounting and administrative departments these costs include labor and benefits professional services financing cost amortization property taxes and profitsharing expense

interest expense   interest expense consists of interest associated with our senior credit facilities and other debt described in the notes to our financial statements net of capitalized interest costs that are related to construction expenditures during the construction period of material capital projects

other income expense   other income consists of interest income earned on our cash balances and any other nonoperating income activity including gains on certain shortterm investments other expense consists of any nonoperating costs

operating results 2006 vs 2005 

net income was 3967 million or 377 per diluted share during 2006 compared with 2218 million or 217 per diluted share during 2005 our gross margin percentage was 26 and 22 during 2006 and 2005 respectively our 2006 average consolidated selling price per ton shipped increased 83 or 14 when compared to 2005 while at the same time costs associated with our metallic raw materials on a comparative basis increased only 6 per net ton consumed these circumstances resulted in increased gross margin 

gross profit    during 2006 our net sales increased 11 billion or 48 to 32 billion while our consolidated shipments increased 11 million tons or 30 to 47 million tons when compared with 2005 the increase in shipments was due to increased shipments at each of our three steelmaking operations and the inclusion of shipments from our roanoke electric operations from the effective date of the merger april 12 2006 through the end of the year our flat roll division increased shipments by 166000 tons or 7 our structural and rail division increased shipments by 192000 tons or 23 which resulted from increased demand for structural products for the nonresidential construction industry our engineered bar products division increased shipments by 145000 tons or 41 during this period as a result of increased demand for specialbarquality products and the continued development of longerterm customer supply relationships during 2006 the engineered bar products division constructed and commenced operations of an onsite finishing facility which has enhanced margins the finishing facility began limited operations during the second quarter of 2006 and became fully operational during the third quarter also included in our 2006 shipments are volumes from our newly acquired roanoke electric steelmaking operations of 458000 tons from our roanoke bar division and 237000 tons from our steel of west virginia operations

our 2006 average consolidated selling price per ton shipped increased 83 compared with 2005 during the third quarter of 2006 inventories increased at steel service centers and prices softened for certain flatrolled products as a consequence during 2006 the volume of steel products imported into the 

united states increased driven by strong demand and shortterm supply constraints for certain products we believe import volumes could decline in the short term as a result of increased inventories however import activity is difficult to forecast we have seen a recovery in our flatrolled order pricing during the first quarter and anticipate further strengthening in the second quarter continued strength within the nonresidential construction market has resulted in sustained strong demand for structural steel and building fabrication products we anticipate a decrease in our first quarter average pricing however we believe we will see some recovery in the second quarter based on current market conditions 

average consolidated quarterly sales price 

generally we incur higher production costs when manufacturing valueadded products such as cold rolled galvanized and painted flat rolled steel as well as specialbarquality steels the following charts depict our steel and fabrication operations productmix by major product category for the years ended december 31 based on tons shipped from these operations 

 

  

metallic raw materials used in our electric arc furnaces represent our most significant manufacturing cost our metallic raw material cost per net ton consumed increased 6 during 2006 as compared to 2005 during 2006 and 2005 respectively our metallic raw material costs represented 53 and 56 of our total manufacturing costs previous to 2004 our metallic raw material costs represented between 45 and 50 of our total manufacturing costs however this percentage increased to as high as 65 in 2004 when the industry encountered historically high steel scrap prices we anticipate an increase in steel scrap prices during the first quarter which when coupled with our anticipated decrease in average product pricing would result in somewhat decreased margins when compared to the fourth quarter of 2006 

quarterly change in cost of metallic raw materials consumed 

selling general and administrative expenses    selling general and administrative expenses were 1709 million during 2006 as compared to 920 million during 2005 an increase of 789 million or 86 our selling general and administrative expenses represented 5 and 4 of our total net sales during 2006 and 2005 respectively

we recorded expense of 450 million and 230 million during 2006 and 2005 respectively related to our steel dynamics performancebased profit sharing plan allocation which is currently calculated as 8 of pretax earnings during 2006 we recorded additional profit sharing expense of 53 million related to certain roanoke electric and other subsidiaries whose employees did not participate in the aforementioned plan until august 1 2006 our board of directors approved an increase from 6 to the current 8 in the profit sharing rate effective august 1 2006 in recognition of the additional plan participants added as a result of the roanoke electric merger 

we adopted fas 123r on january 1 2006 which requires companies to recognize the cost of employee services received in exchange for awards of equitybased instruments in the financial statements during 2006 we recorded 75 million of equitybased compensation expense related to our outstanding incentive stock options 

interest expense   during 2006 gross interest expense decreased 13 million or 4 to 338 million and capitalized interest increased 956000 to 17 million when compared to 2005 the interest capitalization that occurred during these periods resulted from the interest required to be capitalized with respect to construction activities at our engineered bar products and structural and rail divisions we currently anticipate gross interest expense to remain consistent throughout 2007

other income expense   other income was 45 million during 2006 as compared to 18 million during 2005 during 2006 other income was principally composed of certain nonoperating revenues recognized at several of the roanoke electric subsidiaries during 2005 other income was principally from the sale of certain equity securities held as shortterm investments

income taxes   during 2006 our income tax provision was 2348 million as compared to 1388 million during 2005 our effective income tax rate was 372 and 385 during 2006 and 2005 respectively during the second quarter of 2006 we decreased our estimated annual effective tax rate to reflect among other things the recognition of research and development tax credits and the reduction in our expected state tax rate due to the roanoke electric merger

operating results 2005 vs 2004 

net income was 2218 million or 217 per diluted share during 2005 compared with 2953 million or 264 per diluted share during 2004 when compared to 2004 our 2005 average consolidated selling price per ton shipped decreased 17 we experienced a compression of 6 in our gross margin percentage not only due to reduced product pricing but also due to increased costs associated with our manufacturing processes caused by a change in the types of products produced and higher energy costs 

gross profit    during 2005 our net sales increased slightly to 22 billion while our consolidated shipments increased 162000 tons or 5 to 36 million tons when compared to 2004 the increase in shipments was primarily due to increased shipments of 93000 tons from our structural and rail division as a result of increased demand for structural products for the commercial construction industry and 39000 tons from our bar products division as a result of the division’s continued efforts to penetrate the specialbarquality market the specialbarquality market is dominated by longterm customer supply contracts our bar products division started operations in january 2004 and since that time has been selling into the spotmarket and commissioning various products for customer testing and certification to develop customer relationships and pursue longterm customer supply contracts

domestic demand for flat rolled products was weaker than expected during the first half of 2005 due to excessive inventories at steel service centers and end users inventories declined through the first half and the market for flat rolled products improved early in the second half and stabilized through yearend scrap prices fluctuated significantly through the year but did not reach the historic highs seen in 2004 nonresidential construction activity improved throughout 2005 resulting in stronger demand for structural steel fabricated steel joists and decking and flat rolled steel products 

during 2005 we experienced an increase in electricity and natural gas costs combined electricity and natural gas costs were 9 and 8 of total costs of goods sold during 2005 and 2004 respectively however these costs increased to 11 of our total costs of goods sold during the second half of 2005 as energy costs increased and as some of our lower priced forwardpurchased gas positions expired natural gas consumption is a much less significant component in the production of steel through electric arc furnace operations such as ours than in traditional steel manufacturing blast furnace operations our metallic raw material cost per net ton consumed decreased 19 during 2005 as compared to 2004 

selling general and administrative expenses   selling general and administrative expenses were 920 million during 2005 as compared to 966 million during 2004 a decrease of 46 million or 5 our total selling general and administrative expenses represented 4 and 5 of net sales during 2005 and 2004 respectively included in our selling general and administrative expenses are costs related to our performancebased profit sharing plan which is based on 6 of pretax earnings and totaled 230 million and 287 million during 2005 and 2004 respectively

interest expense   during 2005 gross interest expense decreased 108 million or 23 to 351 million and capitalized interest decreased 62 million to 730000 as compared to 2004 this decrease in gross interest expense was the result of interest expense of 60 million that was recorded during 2004 in conjunction with a onetime shortterm us treasury bond transaction the interest capitalization that occurred during these periods resulted from the interest required to be capitalized with respect to construction activities at our bar products division and structural  rail division

other income expense   other income was 18 million during 2005 as compared to 70 million during 2004 during the third quarter of 2005 we recorded gains of 13 million from the sale of certain equity securities during the first quarter of 2004 we entered into a shortterm us treasury bond transaction to generate net interest income in an increasing interest rate environment and to generate capital gains this transaction was completed during the fourth quarter and we recorded associated gains of 54 million during 2004

income taxes    during 2005 our income tax provision was 1388 million as compared to 1797 million during the same period in 2004 our effective income tax rate was increased to 38 for the second half of 2004 due to increased profitability we further increased our effective income tax rate to 385 beginning january 1 2005 in anticipation of the year’s expected profitability levels and the resulting impact to our state income taxes

liquidity and capital resources 

our business is capital intensive and requires substantial expenditures for among other things the purchase and maintenance of equipment used in our steelmaking and finishing operations and to remain in compliance with environmental laws our shortterm and longterm liquidity needs arise primarily from capital expenditures working capital requirements and principal and interest payments related to our outstanding indebtedness we have met these liquidity requirements with cash provided by operations equity longterm borrowings state and local grants and capital cost reimbursements 

working capital   during 2006 our operational working capital position representing our cash invested in trade receivables and inventories less trade payables and accruals increased 2235 million to 6589 million compared to december 31 2005 approximately 1246 million of working capital was associated with the roanoke electric merger trade receivables increased 1549 million or 61 during 2006 to 4084 million of which more than 95 were current or less than 60 days past due our largest customer is an affiliated company heidtman steel which represented 13 and 15 of our outstanding trade receivables at december 31 2006 and 2005 respectively during 2006 our inventories increased 1824 million or 47 to 5693 million raw materials and finished goods generally increased during 2006 for all of our steelmaking divisions our trade payables and general accruals increased 1138 million or 55 during 2006

capital expenditures   during 2006 we invested 1286 million in property plant and equipment of which slightly more than 65 was related to the completion of a bar finishing facility at our engineered bar products division the continued construction of a welding facility at our structural and rail division and the continued reconfiguration of the three acquired roanoke electric joist plants the remaining capital expenditures represented improvement projects at our existing facilities including the caster expansion at our flat roll division we believe these capital investments will increase our net sales and related cash flows as each project develops

capital resources and longterm debt   during 2006 our total outstanding debt including unamortized bond premium decreased 17 million to 4389 million during 2006 holders of our 40 convertible subordinated notes converted 775 million of the notes to steel dynamics common stock resulting in the issuance of 9115175 shares from our treasury reserves there are currently 4410573 shares still available for conversion pursuant to these notes our longterm debt to capitalization ratio representing our longterm debt divided by the sum of our longterm debt and our total stockholders’ equity was 26 and 33 at december 31 2006 and 2005 respectively

at december 31 2006 there were outstanding borrowings of 80 million under our 350 million senior secured revolving credit facility the senior secured credit agreement is secured by substantially all of our and our whollyowned subsidiaries receivables and inventories and by pledges of all shares of capital stock and intercompany debt held by us and each of our whollyowned subsidiaries the senior secured credit agreement contains financial covenants and other covenants that limit or restrict our ability to make capital expenditures incur indebtedness permit liens on property enter into transactions with affiliates make restricted payments or investments enter into mergers acquisitions or consolidations conduct asset sales pay dividends or distributions and enter into other specified transactions and activities our ability to borrow funds within the terms of the revolver is dependent upon our continued compliance with the financial covenants and other covenants contained in the senior secured credit agreement we were in 

compliance with these covenants at december 31 2006 and expect to remain in compliance during the next twelve months 

common stock purchases   from time to time our board of directors authorizes management to repurchase shares of steel dynamics common stock through open market trades we repurchased 94 million shares for 2474 million during 2006 118 million shares for 1864 million during 2005 and 32 million shares for 554 million during 2004 as of december 31 2006 we had remaining authorization in place from our board of directors to repurchase approximately 56 million additional shares the repurchase program does not have an expiration date

cash dividends   we declared cash dividends of 478 million or 500 per share during 2006 177 million or 200 per share during 2005 and 123 million or 125 per share during 2004 we paid cash dividends of 375 million 183 million and 75 million during 2006 2005 and 2004 respectively we anticipate continuing comparable quarterly cash dividends throughout 2007 the determination to pay cash dividends in the future will be at the discretion of our board of directors after taking into account various factors including our financial condition results of operations outstanding indebtedness current and anticipated cash needs and growth plans in addition the terms of our senior secured revolving credit agreement and the indenture relating to our senior notes restrict the amount of cash dividends we can pay

stock split   our board of directors authorized a twoforone stock split in the form of a stock dividend for shareholders of record at the close of business on november 9 2006 and also authorized an increase in our authorized common shares from 100 million shares with a par value of 01 per common share to 200 million shares with a par value of 005 per common share all prior period share and per share amounts have been adjusted to reflect this stock split

other   our ability to meet our debt service obligations and reduce our total debt will depend upon our future performance which in turn will depend upon general economic financial and business conditions along with competition legislation and regulatory factors that are largely beyond our control in addition we cannot assure you that our operating results cash flow and capital resources will be sufficient for repayment of our indebtedness in the future we believe that based upon current levels of operations and anticipated growth cash flow from operations together with other available sources of funds including additional borrowings under our senior secured credit agreement will be adequate for the next two years for making required payments of principal and interest on our indebtedness funding working capital requirements and funding anticipated capital expenditures

during 2007 we currently anticipate spending approximately 400 million on capital improvement projects at our existing facilities and on among others the following capital projects approximately 200 million in connection with the addition of a second rolling mill at our structural and rail division 50 million in connection with the reconfiguration of three of our joist plants 40 million in connection with the addition of a paint line and other coating capabilities at our jeffersonville galvanizing facility 40 million in connection with certain upgrades at our roanoke bar division 40 million in connection with various raw material sourcing projects and 30 million of various smaller individual projects at our existing operations these amounts do not include capital requirements that may arise from our involvement in new joint ventures or merger and acquisition activity that may occur throughout the year 

during 2006 we received benefits from state and local governments in the form of real estate and personal property tax abatements and credits of approximately 58 million based on our current abatements and incentive credits and utilizing our existing longlived asset structure we estimate the remaining annual effect on future operations to be approximately 50 million 42 million 36 million 23 million 17 million 15 million 420000 340000 and 148000 during the years 2007 through 2015 respectively 

contractual obligations and other longterm liabilities 

we have the following minimum commitments under contractual obligations including purchase obligations as defined by the us securities and exchange commission a “purchase obligation” is defined as an agreement to purchase goods or services that is enforceable and legally binding and that specifies all significant terms including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased fixed minimum or variable price provisions and the approximate timing of the transaction other longterm liabilities are defined as longterm liabilities that are reflected on our balance sheet under generally accepted accounting principles based on this definition the following table includes only those contracts which include fixed or minimum obligations it does not include normal purchases which are made in the ordinary course of business the following table provides aggregated information about outstanding contractual obligations and other longterm liabilities as of december 31 2006 dollars in thousands 

 

1   the longterm debt payment information presented above assumes that our senior unsecured notes and our convertible subordinated notes remain outstanding until maturity our 300 million senior unsecured notes are currently redeemable and available for repurchase and the earliest date at which redemption or repurchase may occur for our 375 million convertible subordinated notes is december 18 2007 refer to note 3 to the consolidated financial statements elsewhere in this report for additional information regarding our longterm debt

2   the estimated interest payments shown above assume interest rates of 95 on our 300 million senior unsecured notes due march 15 2009 40 on our 375 million convertible subordinated notes due december 15 2012 54 on our outstanding senior secured revolver balance and 77  on our other fixed rate debt of approximately 176 million

3   purchase obligations include commitments we have for the purchase of natural gas and its transportation to be utilized within our production process these arrangements have “take or pay” or other similar commitment provisions we have fully utilized all such “take or pay” requirements during the past three years under these contracts

4   construction commitments relate to firm contracts we have with various vendors for the completion of certain construction projects at our various divisions at december 31 2006

other matters 

inflation 

we believe that inflation has not had a material effect on our results of operations 

environmental and other contingencies 

we have incurred and in the future will continue to incur capital expenditures and operating expenses for matters relating to environmental control remediation monitoring and compliance during 2006 we incurred costs related to the monitoring and compliance of environmental matters in the amount of approximately 23 million and capital expenditures related to environmental compliance of approximately 800000 over 50 of the costs incurred during 2006 for monitoring and compliance were 

related to the normal transportation of certain types of waste produced in the steelmaking process in accordance with legal requirements we incurred combined environmental remediation costs of approximately 112000 at two of our joist plants during 2006 there were no known outstanding contingent matters related to environmental remediation therefore there were no related accruals recorded at december 31 2006 we believe apart from our dependence on environmental construction and operating permits for our existing and proposed manufacturing facilities that compliance with current environmental laws and regulations is not likely to have a materially adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or liquidity however environmental laws and regulations have changed rapidly in recent years and we may become subject to more stringent environmental laws and regulations in the future 

recent accounting pronouncements and developments 

in note 1 to our consolidated financial statements we discuss new accounting policies adopted by steel dynamics during 2006 and the expected financial impact of accounting policies recently issued or proposed but not yet required to be adopted 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

management’s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america we review the accounting policies we use in reporting our financial results on a regular basis the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities we evaluate the appropriateness of these estimations and judgments on an ongoing basis we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources results may differ from these estimates due to actual outcomes being different from those on which we based our assumptions we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 

revenue recognition and allowance for doubtful accounts   we recognize revenues from sales and the allowance for estimated costs associated with returns from these sales when the title of the product transfers upon shipment provision is made for estimated product returns and customer claims based on estimates and actual historical experience if the historical data used in our estimates does not reflect future returns and claims trends additional provision may be necessary our steel joist and steel decking operation new millennium building systems recognizes revenues from construction contracts on a percentage of completion method based on steel consumed to date as a percentage of the estimated total steel required for each contract new millennium accounted for 8 of our 2006 net sales

we are exposed to credit risk in the event of nonpayment by our customers which are principally intermediate steel processors and service centers that sell our products to numerous industry sectors including the automotive construction commercial transportation and industrial machinery markets we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments based on known credit risks historical loss experience and current economic conditions affecting our customers we mitigate our exposure to credit risk by performing ongoing credit evaluations and taking further action when necessary such as requiring letters of credit or other security interests to support the receivable from our customer if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate resulting in the impairment of their ability to make payments additional allowance may be required 

impairments of longlived assets   in accordance with the methodology described in fasb statement no 144 accounting for the impairment or disposal of longlived assets  we review longlived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable impairment losses are recorded on longlived assets used in operations when indicators of impairment are present and the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than the assets’ carrying amounts the impairment loss is measured by comparing the fair value of the asset to its carrying amount

deferred tax assets and liabilities   we are required to estimate our income taxes as a part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements this requires us to estimate our actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatments of items for tax and accounting purposes these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities which are included within our consolidated balance sheet we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely we must establish a valuation allowance




 item 7a   quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

market risk 

in the normal course of business we are exposed to interest rate changes our objectives in managing exposure to interest rate changes are to limit the impact of these rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower overall borrowing costs to achieve these objectives we primarily use interest rate swaps to manage net exposure to interest rate changes related to our portfolio of borrowings we generally maintain fixed rate debt as a percentage of our net debt between a minimum and maximum percentage a portion of our debt has an interest component that resets on a periodic basis to reflect current market conditions the following table represents the principal cash repayments and related weightedaverage interest rates by maturity date for our longterm debt as of december 31 2006 in thousands 

 

  

commodity risk 

in the normal course of business we are exposed to the market risk and price fluctuations related to the sale of steel products and to the purchase of commodities used in our production process such as metallic raw materials electricity natural gas and alloys our risk strategy associated with product sales has generally been to obtain competitive prices for our products and to allow operating results to reflect market price movements dictated by supply and demand during 2006 approximately 7 of our net sales were under fixedprice contracts with greater than twelve month commitments 

our risk strategy associated with the purchase of commodities utilized within our production process has generally been to make certain commitments with suppliers relating to future expected requirements for such commodities certain commitments contain provisions which require us to “take or pay” for 

specified quantities without regard to actual usage for periods of up to two years for physical commodity requirements and for up to 15 years for commodity transportation requirements  our commitments for natural gas and its transportation with “take or pay” or other similar commitment provisions for the years ending december 31 are as follows in thousands 

 

  

we fully utilized all such “take or pay” requirements during the past three years and purchased 635 million 366 million and 205 million during the years ended december 31 2006 2005 and 2004 respectively under these contracts we believe that production requirements will be such that consumption of the products or services purchased under these commitments will occur in the normal production process we also purchase electricity consumed at our flat roll division pursuant to a contract which extends through december 2007 the contract designates 180 hours annually as “interruptible service” and establishes an agreed fixed rate energy charge per millkwh consumed for each year through the expiration of the agreement

 item 1   business

our company 

overview 

we are a steel manufacturing company that owns and operates three steel producing minimills with an estimated combined annual production capacity of 42 million tons we also operate two joist and deck manufacturing plants with an estimated combined annual capacity of 200000 tons and an ironmaking facility that produces hot briquetted iron and liquid pig iron we produce our steel principally from steel scrap using electric arc furnaces continuous casting and automated rolling mills 

on october 18 2005 we announced the execution of a definitive agreement to acquire the steelmaking and fabricating businesses of roanoke electric steel corporation or roanoke in a merger 

transaction for a combination of stock and cash a special meeting of roanoke’s stockholders is scheduled for april 11 2006 to vote on this transaction and if approved we expect to close the acquisition shortly thereafter 

during 2005 our net sales were 22 billion and at december 31 2005 we had 1795 employees none of our employees are currently represented by labor unions 

steel dynamics inc was incorporated in august 1993 in indiana we maintain our principal executive offices at 6714 pointe inverness way suite 200 fort wayne indiana 46804 our telephone number is 260 4593553 

flat roll division 

our flat roll mill located in butler indiana with an estimated annual production capacity of 26 million tons manufactures hot rolled cold rolled and coated steel products the products produced in this facility are characterized by high quality surface characteristics precise tolerances and light gauge 

the flat roll mill sells the majority of its hot rolled coil production directly to endusers or to intermediate steel processors or service centers where they may be pickled coldrolled annealed tempered galvanized or painted by those customers the balance of the mill’s hot rolled coil production is directed to the cold mill where the company adds value to this product through pickling coldrolling annealing tempering galvanizing or painting the butler mill supplies steel dynamics’ jeffersonville indiana galvanizing facility with coldrolled material 

we operate an onsite paint line with an estimated annual coating capacity of 240000 tons in gauges from 010 to 070 inches and in widths ranging from 36 to 64 inches and we believe that ours is the only mill in north america with such an onsite paint line the paint line receives material directly from the other processing lines and is capable of painting pickled cold rolled and hot and cold rolled galvanized steel 

our jeffersonville indiana galvanizing facility is located within the clark maritime centre on the ohio river the galvanizing line has an estimated capacity of between 300000 and 350000 tons per year and is capable of coating cold rolled steel in gauges from 008 to 045 inches and in widths between 24 and 60 inches this gauge range is lighter than that available from the butler facility and therefore creates a further expansion of value added product offerings particularly in the light gauge building products arena we acquired this facility is 2003 the ohio river location has enabled us to better serve existing cold rolled galvanized customers and expand our customer base into other geographic regions our butler cold mill provides the jeffersonville facility with cold rolled steel 

the flat roll division’s products include a variety of high quality low and medium carbon and high strength low alloy hotrolled bands in 40 inch to 62 inch widths and in thicknesses from 500 inch down to 043 inch the mill also produces an array of light gauge hotrolled products ranging in thickness from 080 inch and thinner including high strength low alloy 80000 minimum yield and medium carbon steels these products are suitable for automobile truck trailer and recreational vehicle parts and components mechanical and structural steel tubing gas and fluid transmission piping metal building systems rail cars ships barges and other marine equipment agricultural equipment and farm implements lawn garden and recreation equipment industrial machinery and shipping containers 

we believe that our hot rolled steel has shape characteristics that exceed those of the other thinslab flatroll minimills and compares favorably with those of the integrated mills in addition as a result of our hot rolling capabilities we are able to produce light gauge hot rolled hotdipped galvanized and galvannealed steel products the light gauge hot rolled products can be used in place of more costly cold rolled galvanized or cold rolled galvannealed steel in many applications our galvanizing capabilities have enabled us to continue to improve the mix of higher margin value added products 

the flat roll division also produces hot rolled pickled and oiled hot rolled galvanized hot rolled galvannealed cold rolled galvanized cold rolled galvannealed and fully processed cold rolled sheet the paint line can paint pickled and oiled hot rolled galvanized cold rolled and cold rolled galvanized steel in gauges from 010 to 070 inches and widths ranging from 36 to 64 inches painted steel is typically used in transportation products building products such as raised garage door panels heating and cooling products appliances furniture and lighting equipment 

the flat roll division’s hot rolled products compete with many north american integrated hot rolled coil producers such as us steel’s plants near detroit michigan granite city illinois gary indiana dravosburg pennsylvania and fairfield alabama ak steel corporation’s plant in middletown ohio and mittal steel’s facilities east chicago illinois riverdale illinois cleveland ohio and indiana harbor indiana burns harbor indiana and sparrow’s point maryland steel dynamics’ flat rolled products also compete with the products of a number of hot rolled minimills such as nucor corporation’s plants in crawfordsville indiana hickman arkansas decatur alabama and berkeley south carolina gallatin steel company’s plant in ghent kentucky and north star bluescope steel’s plant in delta ohio our flat rolled products compete as well with companies that convert steel slabs into sheet steel such as duferco steel in farrell pennsylvania 

we also compete with many of these same producers for the sale of cold rolled and coated products as well as with a number of companies such as worthington steel of columbus ohio winner steel of sharon pennsylvania and the techs of pittsburgh pennsylvania which buy their hot rolled or cold rolled steel from other producers and then convert them into products that are competitive with our products 

structural and rail division 

our columbia city indiana structural steel and rail minimill is designed to produce structural steel beams pilings and other steel components for the construction transportation and industrial machinery markets as well as standard and premium grade rails for the railroad industry the plant has an estimated annual production capacity of 10 million tons dependent upon the mix of products we produce 

the structural and rail division has the capability to produce various structural steel products such as wide flange beams american standard beams miscellaneous beams “h” piling material american standard and miscellaneous channels bulb angles and “zee’s” the principal customers for our structural steel products are steel service centers steel fabricators and various manufacturers service centers though not the ultimate end user provide valuable mill distribution functions to the fabricators and manufacturers including small quantity sales repackaging cutting preliminary processing and warehousing a majority of the structural steel products are sold to service centers 

our columbia city mill will produce rail in standard and premium or headhardened grades in a range of weights from 115 lbs per yard to 141 lbs per yard in lengths from the traditional 39 feet up to 240 feet initially and ultimately to 320 feet we also intend to weld these 240320 foot rails into 1600 foot strings for delivery to the installation site such long strings offer customers substantial savings both in terms of initial capital cost and through reduced maintenance in contrast current production of rail in the united states and available imported rail is limited to 80foot lengths as a result of existing plant layout restrictions and the physical limitations of ocean freight the cost of maintaining railroad track is highest at welds where excessive wear and fatigue cracks can occur we expect that our ability to produce track lengths of up to 320 feet will reduce maintenance costs for our customers 

demand for structural steel products is driven by nonresidential construction activity which is in turn affected by such cyclical factors as general economic conditions interest rates inflation consumer spending and employment our structural steel products compete with a sizable number of electric arc furnace structural steelmakers such as nucor steel in berkeley south carolina nucoryamato steel in blytheville arkansas and chaparral steel in midlothian texas and petersburg virginia there are also a 

number of smaller competitors including gerdau ameristeel in cartersville georgia and bayou steel in laplace louisiana 

at present the rail market is principally served by two producers rocky mountain steel in pueblo colorado a division of oregon steel mills inc and mittal steel in steelton pennsylvania each of these producers has the capability to produce either standard or premium rail we will also compete with similar products from a number of high quality integrated and electric furnace steel producers in europe and asia including corus voestalpine schienen nippon steel and nkk 

bar products division 

we purchased our pittsboro indiana bar products minimill in september 2002 and during 2004 completed a program to upgrade and retrofit the mill to produce a broad line of special bar quality or sbq products as well as merchant long products the bar products mill has an estimated annual capacity of 500000 to 600000 tons 

special bar quality products are uniquely designed to be in motion and include such items as gears shafts and forgings and we anticipate that we will operate our pittsboro facility primarily if not exclusively to produce sbq products the pittsboro facility can produce sbq rounds in sizes from 1 to 9 inches and sbq round cornered squares in sizes from 2 to 8 inches sbq products are principally consumed by cold finishers forgers intermediate processors oem manufacturers steel service centers and distributors 

major competitors for sbq product sales within a 500 mile radius of pittsboro include republic engineered products of akron ohio the timken company of canton ohio quanexmacsteel in jackson michigan and monroe michigan and mittal steel in east chicago indiana 

new millennium building systems 

our new millennium building systems subsidiary operates two production facilities a facility in butler indiana which began production in june of 2000 and a new lake city florida facility which began production during 2005 both plants produce steel building components including joists girders trusses and steel roof and floor decking which are sold to the nonresidential building components market the flat roll division supplies a majority of the hot rolled steel utilized in new millennium’s manufacturing operations during 2005 new millennium produced 104000 tons of steel building components in the butler indiana facility and 37000 tons at its lake city florida facility 

we manufacture a complete line of joist products including bowstring arched scissor doublepitched and singlepitched joists decking products include a full range of roof form and composite floor decks 

our main competitors on a national level in the joist business are vulcraft a division of nucor canam and cmc steel group a division of commercial metals in the steel decking business our main competitors on a national level are vulcraft wheeling corrugating co a division of wheeling pittsburgh steel corp and united steel deck inc new millennium also has a number of regional competitors located in the upper midwest including canam socar and gooderhenderson as well as several local suppliers with facilities located in pittsburgh cleveland detroit indianapolis chicago and milwaukee regional competitors to the lake city florida plant include canam and quiney joist 

financing 

at december 31 2005 our total outstanding debt including unamortized bond premium was 4406 million our longterm debt to capitalization ratio representing our longterm debt divided by the sum of our longterm debt and our total stockholders’ equity was 33 at december 31 2005 

on september 7 2005 we replaced our 230 million 4year revolving credit facility with a new 5year 350 million senior secured revolving credit facility which includes a provision to increase the new facility by as much as 100 million under certain circumstances the proceeds from the revolver will be available for working capital and other general corporate purposes including merger and acquisition activity at december 31 2005 there were no outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facility 

the senior secured credit agreement is secured by substantially all of our and our whollyowned subsidiary’s receivables and inventories and by pledges of all shares of capital stock and intercompany debt held by us and each of our whollyowned subsidiaries the senior secured credit agreement contains financial covenants and other covenants that limit or restrict our ability to make capital expenditures incur indebtedness permit liens on property enter into transactions with affiliates make restricted payments or investments enter into mergers acquisitions or consolidations conduct asset sales pay dividends or distributions and enter into other specified transactions and activities our ability to borrow funds within the terms of the revolver is dependent upon our continued compliance with the financial covenants and other covenants contained in the senior secured credit agreement we were in compliance with these covenants at february 28 2006 and expect to remain in compliance during the next twelve months 

competitive strengths 

we believe that the following are some of our competitive strengths 

one of the lowest cost producers in the united states stateoftheart facilities 

we believe that our facilities are among the lowestcost steel producing facilities in the united states our low operating costs are primarily a result of our efficient plant designs and operations our high productivity rate of approximately 03 man hours per hot band ton produced at our flat roll division’s minimill low ongoing maintenance cost requirements and strategic locations near sources of our primary raw material scrap steel and our customers 

experienced management team and unique corporate culture 

our senior management team is highly experienced and has a proven track record in the steel industry including pioneering the development of thinslab flat rolled technology their objectives are closely aligned with our stockholders through meaningful stock ownership positions and performancebased compensation programs our corporate culture is also unique for the steel industry we emphasize decentralized decision making and have established incentive compensation programs specifically designed to reward employee teams for their efforts towards enhancing productivity improving profitability and controlling costs 

diversified product mix 

our current products on a companywide basis include hot rolled cold rolled galvanized and painted sheet steel various structural steel beams and rails special bar quality steel and joists and deck materials we plan to construct and operate a second paint line at our jeffersonville galvanizing facility and add the capability to produce galvalume at the jeffersonville facility to further enrich our product mix this diversified mix of products enables us to access a broader range of enduser markets serve a broader customer base and mitigate our exposure to cyclical downturns in commodity grade flatrolled products or in any one product or enduser market 

strategic geographic locations 

the locations of our steelmaking facilities near sources of scrap materials and near our customer base allow us to realize freight savings for inbound scrap as well as for outbound steel products destined for our customers our minimills are located in the upper midwest a region which we believe accounts for a majority of the total scrap produced in the united states our jeffersonville indiana galvanizing facility on the ohio river also provides us with an expanded geographic reach to southern markets 

business strategy 

expand product offerings 

the completion of our structural and rail mill the completion of the paint line by our flat roll division as well as our acquisitions of the pittsboro indiana bar mill and the jeffersonville indiana galvanizing facility as well as the expansions and upgrades of both facilities are important steps in pursuing our strategy of product line expansion the structural and rail division is strategically located to serve the upper midwest northeast and canadian markets which we believe are attractive and underserved markets our strategy to expand our flat rolled steel product offerings is to focus on the production of high valueadded light gauge products galvanized products and various coated products the margins on high valueadded products typically exceed those of the commodity grade and the number of producers that make them is more limited our bar products division is likewise strategically located to costeffectively serve sbq markets we will continue to seek additional opportunities to further expand our range of high valueadded products through the expansion of existing facilities greenfield projects and acquisitions of other steel producers or steelmaking assets that may become available through the continuing consolidation of the domestic steel industry 

enter new geographic markets 

we may seek to enter new steel markets in strategic geographic locations that offer attractive growth opportunities the recent greenfield expansion of our new millennium joist and deck business in lake city florida is an example of such activity 

continue to maintain low production costs 

we are focused on continuing to maintain one of the lowest operating cost structures in the north american steel industry based upon operating cost per ton we will continue to strive to optimize the use of our equipment enhance our productivity and explore new technologies to further improve our unit cost of production at each of our facilities 

foster entrepreneurial culture 

we intend to continue to foster our entrepreneurial corporate culture and emphasize decentralized decision making while rewarding teamwork innovation and operating efficiency we will also continue to focus on maintaining the effectiveness of our incentivebased bonus plans that are designed to enhance overall productivity and align the interests of our management and employees with our stockholders

our business 

operations 

flat roll division 

our butler minimill manufactures flat rolled hot rolled cold rolled and coated steel products it currently has an estimated annual capacity of 26 million tons we produced 24 million tons and 25 million tons at this facility during 2004 and 2005 respectively our products are characterized by high quality surface characteristics precise tolerances and light gauge in addition our minimill was one of the first us flat roll minimills to achieve iso 9002 and qs 9000 certifications we believe that these certifications have enabled us to serve a broader range of customers and endusers 

we have two twinshell electric arc furnaces which enable us to melt scrap in one vessel while tapping the other vessel and refilling it with scrap and scrap substitute to make it ready for the next heat this results in more heats and greater productivity per shift we have three ladle metallurgy stations two continuous thinslab casters which produce a twoinch slab and two tunnel furnaces our hot rolling mill which progressively reduces the slab in thickness consists of a sevenstand rolling mill capable of rolling sheet steel down to 10mm with excellent surface quality which enables us to access markets previously available only to more costly cold finished material 

we sell a portion of our hot band coil production directly to endusers or to intermediate steel processors or service centers where they may be pickled cold rolled annealed tempered galvanized or painted by those customers the rest of our hot band coil production is directed to our cold mill where we add value to this product through our own pickling cold rolling annealing tempering galvanizing and painting processes a portion of our cold rolled production is shipped to our jeffersonville indiana galvanizing facility 

our cold mill is located adjacent to our hot mill and produces products that require gauges properties or surface conditions that cannot be achieved in our hot mill 

from a central coil storage area we can move our coils in one of three directions we can 1 ship pickled and oiled coils directly to customers from the continuous pickled line as finished product 2 immediately galvanize some coils on the hotrolled galvanizing line to be then sold as finished product or 3 process coils through our cold reversing mill one of only two twostand reversing cold rolling operations in the world 

our onsite paint line located adjacent to our cold mill was completed during 2003 and has an estimated coating capacity of 240000 tons per year in gauges from 010 to 070 inches and in widths ranging from 36 to 64 inches the paint line receives material directly from our other processing lines and is capable of painting hot rolled galvanized coil cold rolled coil and cold rolled galvanized coil the line incorporates stateoftheart coil coating equipment with quick color change capability and online color matching we believe that we are the only mill in north america with an onsite paint line which we 

believe will enable us to realize substantial savings in overhead maintenance engineering sales and marketing capital costs and infrastructure but will eliminate the typical cost of transfer freight that a customer must otherwise pay to transport coils to other remote coating facilities 

our jeffersonville indiana cold rolled galvanizing facility which we purchased in march 2003 for 19 million is located within the clark maritime centre on the ohio river the galvanizing line has an estimated capacity of between 300000 and 350000 tons per year and is capable of coating cold rolled steel in gauges from 008 to 045 inches and in widths between 24 and 60 inches this gauge range is lighter than that available from our butler facility and creates further expansion of our value added product offerings the galvanizing line was built in 1999 and is similar to the cold rolled galvanizing line at our butler mill on february 7 2006 we announced plans to expand our offering of valueadded flat rolled steel products at our jeffersonville facility through the addition of three strategic capabilities we plan to invest approximately 40 million during 2006 in plant and equipment in order to produce prepainted steel acryliccoated steel and 55 aluminumzinc alloy coated steel construction is expected to begin in april 2006 with operations commencing in the second quarter of 2007 the paint line will have an expected annual capacity of 190000 tons 

our butler cold mill provides our jeffersonville facility with cold rolled material the ohio river location of our jeffersonville facility also creates opportunities for market expansion into other geographic regions 

structural and rail division 

we began construction of our structural steel and rail minimill in columbia city indiana in may 2001 completed plant construction in april 2002 and commenced commercial structural steel operations during the third quarter of 2002 the structural minimill is designed to have an annual production capacity of up to 10 million tons of structural steel beams pilings and other steel components for the construction transportation and industrial machinery markets as well as standard and premium grade rails for the railroad industry our facility melts scrap and scrap substitutes in a singleshell electric arc furnace although we have a second singleshell furnace which provides us with backup melting capability our continuous caster casts three strands expandable to four of various sized blooms and beam blanks in varying lengths of 17 to 48 feet we can transport the cast strands either directly through a reheat furnace to our advanced fourstand all reversing hot rolling mill or into a storage area for rolling at a later time in the hot rolling mill we can roll the product into either a structural steel product or a rail product 

through regular product introductions and continued production rampup of structural steel products we were able to begin to offer a broad array of wide flange beams and hpiling structural steel products during 2003 we expanded our product offerings to include 36 inch beams in 2004 and 6 inch beams during the second quarter of 2005 

for the production of rail products we fitted our caster with special molds and segments to cast the new 13” x 10” blooms required for rail production we commissioned the casting and rolling equipment for the production of rail products during 2003 and in 2004 commissioned the rail finishing and inspection facility during subsequent 2004 rolling trials however we determined that the finished rail sections contained certain quality imperfections which we traced to the casting process while the resulting product was acceptable for industrial use it did not qualify for class i railroad use so we made process and equipment modifications required to address the quality issue we are now able to produce class i quality standard rail which we expect to provide to the railroad companies for evaluation during the second quarter of 2006 we expect to be capable of manufacturing highly desirable 320foot rail lengths which no one else produces in or imports into the us or canadian rail markets 

bar products division 

we purchased our pittsboro indiana bar minimill in september 2002 and during 2004 completed our announced program to upgrade and retrofit the mill to produce a broad array of special bar quality or sbq products as well as merchant long products as of december 31 2005 we had invested approximately 1647 million in the facility which includes the original acquisition cost of 45 million and some additional costs related to capital improvement projects the mill was originally constructed in 1997 as an sbq mill and as upgraded consists of a 100ton singleshell ac furnace a threestand continuous caster capable of casting both a 7”x7” billet and a 14”x10” bloom a reheat furnace and a rolling mill consisting of a roughing mill and intermediate mill as well as reducing and sizing blocks used in the production of sbq rounds 

the pittsboro facility has an estimated annual production capacity of between 500000 and 600000 tons during 2005 we produced 378000 tons at this facility substantially all of it sbq products and we expect to employ this facility primarily if not exclusively for the manufacture of sbq products 

new millennium building systems 

the new millennium butler indiana facility which began production in june of 2000 produces steel building components including joists girders trusses and steel roof and floor decking which we sell primarily in the upper midwest nonresidential building components market our flat roll division supplies a majority of the hotrolled steel utilized in new millennium’s manufacturing operations during 2005 new millennium produced 104000 tons of steel building components in its butler indiana facility 

in september 2004 new millennium began construction of a new 270000 square foot manufacturing facility in lake city florida this plant manufactures a similar array of steel building components as our butler indiana facility and markets these products primarily in florida and in the southeastern part of the united states the florida facility began shipping joist products in february 2005 and began shipping decking material in april 2005 during 2005 new millennium produced 37000 tons of steel building components in its lake city facility we also supply our new florida plant with hot rolled steel from our flat roll division 

iron dynamics steel scrap substitute facility and our mesabi nugget project 

historically the price of steel scrap as a commodity has tended to be volatile rising and falling with supply and demand and not always in lock step with or in proportion to the market price of new steel more recently and increasingly so during 2004 and into 2005 scrap costs accelerated to historic highs threatening one of the principal elements of the minimills’ traditional lower cost structure—the cost of its metallic raw material therefore having a lower cost alternative source of iron for a portion of a minimill’s melt mix if realizable would partially buffer the effects of high scrap prices and scrap price volatility with the growing proportion of electric furnace steelmaking both worldwide and domestically we believe that the benefits of developing a costeffective alternate iron source to augment scrap our primary raw material makes good economic sense in the long run 

since 1997 iron dynamics has tried to develop and commercialize a pioneering process of producing a form of iron that might serve as a lower cost substitute for a portion of the metallic raw material mix that goes into our electric arc furnaces to be melted into new steel direct reduced iron is a metallic product made from iron ore or iron ore “fines” that have been treated in a “direct reduction” furnace such as a rotary hearth furnace with either natural gas or coal to reduce the iron oxide to metallic iron the method selected by iron dynamics is one that uses coal as the reducing agent the direct reduced iron or dri is then compacted by briquetters to form hot briquetted iron or hbi which is stable and can be immediately used in our melting furnaces or stockpiled for later use liquid pig iron the ultimate end product intended to be produced by iron dynamics is a pure metal product produced by smelting the direct reduced iron in 

a submerged arc furnace we have used and plan to use all of iron dynamics’ hbi and liquid pig iron in our steelmaking operations 

since the plant’s initial startup in august 1999 we have made continuous process design and equipment modifications as we encountered various quality and consistency issues with this pioneering technology during 2003 after further evaluation of certain production trials we concluded that our improved production technology coupled with our ability to recycle waste materials as part of our raw material mix and the increasingly higher price of scrap warranted further modifications and refinements and these were completed in connection with the liquid pig iron conversion process the direct reduced iron is first liquefied and the hot liquid pig iron is then transferred in ladles to the flat roll mill’s meltshop and combined with scrap steel in the mill’s electric arc furnaces during 2005 the iron dynamics facility produced 220000 tonnes of direct reduced iron of which 129000 tonnes were converted into hbi and 72000 tonnes were converted into liquid pig iron 

mesabi nugget project 

in march 2002 we formed a joint venture with certain entities owned by kobe steel ltd clevelandcliffs inc and ferrometrics inc to pursue the development of a proprietary process owned by kobe known as “itmk3®” for the production of a fully metallized iron nugget product suitable for use as an alternative iron or scrap substitute feedstock in electric arc furnace steelmaking based on the successful operation of the pilot plant we are planning to invest approximately 30 million in a joint venture over the next year to construct a fullscale commercial plant we expect to own a substantial portion of the equity in this joint venture and to enter into an offtake agreement with the joint venture to purchase iron nuggets for use in our steelmaking operations 

products and customers 

flat roll division 

products   our flat roll division produces hot rolled products that include a variety of high quality mild and medium carbon and high strength low alloy hot rolled bands in 40 inch to 62 inch widths and in thicknesses from 500 inch down to 043 inch we also produce an array of lighter gauge hotrolled products including high strength low alloy and medium carbon steels these products are suitable for automobile truck trailer and recreational vehicle parts and components mechanical and structural steel tubing gas and fluid transmission piping metal building systems rail cars ships barges and other marine equipment agricultural equipment and farm implements lawn garden and recreation equipment industrial machinery and shipping containers

we believe that our basic production hot band material has shape characteristics that exceed those of other thinslab flat roll minimills and compares favorably with those of the integrated mills in addition as a result of our lighter gauge hot rolling capabilities we are able to produce hot rolled galvanized and galvannealed steel products these products are capable of replacing products that have traditionally only been available as more costly cold rolled galvanized or cold rolled galvannealed steel 

we also produce hot rolled pickled and oiled hot rolled galvanized hot rolled galvannealed cold rolled galvanized cold rolled galvannealed and fully processed cold rolled sheet our paint line paints pickled and oiled hot rolled galvanized coil cold rolled coil and cold rolled galvanized coil in gauges from 010 to 070 inches and widths ranging from 36 inches to 64 inches this material is typically used in transportation products building products such as raised garage door panels heating and cooling products appliances furniture and lighting equipment 

customers   the following tables show information about the types of flat rolled products we sold and the types of customers we sold them to during the respective years 

 

  

steel processors and service centers typically act as intermediaries between primary steel producers and the many enduser manufacturers that require further processing of hot bands the additional processing performed by the intermediate steel processors and service centers include pickling galvanizing cutting to length slitting to size leveling blanking shape correcting edge rolling shearing and stamping we expect that our intermediate steel processor and service center customers will remain an integral part of our customer base our flat roll division’s sales outside the continental united states accounted for approximately 2 of the division’s net sales in 2005 

during 2005 we sold our products to approximately 210 customers during 2005 our largest three customers accounted for approximately 22 of our consolidated net sales heidtman accounted individually for approximately 12 and 10 of our consolidated net sales in 2004 and 2005 respectively 

structural and rail division

competition 

flat roll division 

the flat roll division’s hot rolled products compete with many north american integrated hot rolled coil producers such as us steel’s plants near detroit michigan granite city illinois gary indiana dravosburg pennsylvania and fairfield alabama ak steel corporation’s plant in middletown ohio and 

mittal steel’s facilities east chicago illinois riverdale illinois cleveland ohio and indiana harbor indiana burns harbor indiana and sparrow’s point maryland steel dynamics’ hotrolled products also compete with the products of a number of hot rolled minimills such as nucor corporation’s plants in crawfordsville indiana hickman arkansas decatur alabama and berkeley south carolina gallatin steel company’s plant in ghent kentucky and north star bluescope steel’s plant in delta ohio our flatrolled products compete as well with companies that convert steel slabs into sheet steel such as duferco steel in farrell pennsylvania 

structural and rail division 

sales of structural steel products are sensitive to the level of construction activity which is in turn affected by such cyclical factors as general economic conditions interest rates inflation consumer spending and employment 

our structural steel products compete with a sizable number of electric arc furnace structural steelmakers some of which have cost structures and flexible management cultures similar to our own notable competitors include nucor steel in berkeley south carolina nucoryamato steel in blytheville arkansas and chaparral steel in midlothian texas and petersburg virginia there are also a number of smaller competitors including gerdau ameristeel in cartersville georgia and bayou steel in laplace louisiana the nucor minimills and the chaparral minimills have accounted for the greatest bulk of the tons produced in north america over the past three years we also believe however that both geography and product choice will play significant roles there are currently no other structural mills located in the midwest one of the largest structural steel consuming regions in the united states and we believe we can provide freightsaving and customer service benefits to end users service centers and fabricators located in the region we also believe that most of canada’s structural steel consumption is located in canada’s eastern provinces closer to us than to either of our two largest competitors moreover we intend to provide a broad product mix focusing on the midrange and larger section served only by nucoryamato steel and chaparral from locations more remote than our minimill 

at present the rail market is principally served by two producers rocky mountain steel in pueblo colorado a division of oregon steel mills inc and mittal steel in steelton pennsylvania each of these producers has the capability to produce either standard or premium rail although neither is equipped to produce rail in 240foot or 320foot lengths we will also compete with products from a number of high quality integrated and electric furnace steel producers in europe and asia including british steel voestalpine schienen nippon steel and nkk 

bar products division 

our major competitors for sbq product sales within a 500 mile radius of pittsboro include republic engineered products of akron ohio the timken company of canton ohio quanexmacsteel in jackson michigan and monroe michigan and mittal steel usa in east chicago indiana 

new millennium building systems 

new millennium’s main competitors on a national level in the joist business are vulcraft a division of nucor canam and cmc a division of commercial metals in the steel decking business new millennium’s main competitors on a national level are vulcraft wheeling corrugating co a division of wheeling pittsburgh steel corp and united steel deck inc new millennium also has a number of competitors on a regional basis located in the upper midwest including canam socar and gooderhenderson as well as several local suppliers with facilities located in pittsburgh cleveland detroit indianapolis chicago and milwaukee regional competitors with our new lake city florida plant will include canam quiney joist cmc and wheeling corrugating 

sources availability and cost of scrap and scrap substitute 

our principal raw material is scrap metal derived from among other sources “home scrap” generated internally at steel mills themselves industrial scrap generated as a byproduct of manufacturing and “obsolete” scrap such as automobiles appliances railroad cars and railroad track materials agricultural machinery and demolition scrap from obsolete structures containers and machines 

scrap 

scrap typically comprises approximately 8085 of the metallic melt mix in electric arc furnace steelmaking in contrast to integrated mill steelmaking where the proportion of scrap has traditionally been approximately 20 depending upon the scrap substitute material that may be available from time to time and the relative cost of such material the percentage of scrap used in our steelmaking operations could be reduced to the range of 60 or less of our metallic melt mix 

many variables can impact scrap prices all of which reflect the pushes and pulls of the supply demand equation these factors include the level of us new steel production for high quality low residual scrap is a byproduct of new steel manufacturing activity the level of exports of scrap from the united states the amount of obsolete scrap production and the effect of speculation on the amount of scrap offered on the market from time to time the us has generally been a net scrap exporter generally as domestic steel demand increased so did scrap demand and resulting scrap prices the reverse was also normally but not always true with scrap prices following steel prices downward where supply exceeded demand 

we believe that the demand for low residual scrap will continue to rise more rapidly than the supply in the coming years especially with the increased number of electric arc furnace minimills both here and abroad that have been built or commenced operations in recent years and especially due to foreign scrap demand 

as a result in order to maintain an available supply of scrap at competitive market prices we have established and intend to maintain multiple strong and dependable sources through which to competitively purchase scrap of all grades including low residual scrap have added our own inhouse scrap purchasing department may establish our own or may joint venture with others to develop scrap facilities and have been active in developing our own sources of scrap substitute products such as iron dynamics and our mesabi nugget project 

scrap substitutes 

direct reduced iron hot briquetted iron and pig iron can substitute for a limited portion of the steel scrap used in electric furnace minimill steel production historically we have used approximately 15 by weight of scrap substitutes in our melt mix mainly imported pig iron during 2005 we consumed approximately 690000 tons of scrap substitutes of the 42 million tons of metallics that we melted in our electric arc furnaces slightly over 30 of the scrap substitutes consumed at our steelmaking facilities came from iron dynamics all purchases of scrap substitutes were made on the spot market at prevailing market prices 

we anticipate that we will continue to utilize all of iron dynamics’ scrap substitute product output whether hbi or liquid pig iron 

flat roll steel market 

flat rolled products represent the largest portion of the domestic steel market flat rolled products consist of hot rolled cold rolled and coated steel 

the following table shows the us shipments of flat rolled steel in net tons of hot rolled cold rolled and coated products as reported by the american iron and steel institute or aisi for the five years from 2000 through 2004 

 

1   includes pipetube sheet strip and plate in coils

2   includes blackplate sheet strip and electrical

3   includes tin coated hot dipped galvanized electrogalvanized and all other metallic coated

hot rolled products 

all flat rolled steel is initially hot rolled hotrolled steel is minimally processed steel coil that is used in the manufacture of various nonsurface critical applications such as automobile suspension arms frames wheels and other unexposed parts in auto and truck bodies agricultural equipment construction products machinery tubing pipe tools lawn care products and guard rails 

cold rolled products 

cold rolled steel is hot rolled steel that has been further processed through a pickler and then successively passed through a rolling mill without reheating until the desired gauge or thickness and other physical properties have been achieved cold rolling reduces gauge and hardens the steel and when further processed through an annealing furnace and a temper mill improves uniformity ductility and formability cold rolling can also impart various surface finishes and textures cold rolled steel is used in exposed steel applications that demand higher surface quality or finish such as exposed automobile and appliance panels as a result of higher processing costs cold rolled prices are typically higher than hot rolled prices cold rolled material is often coated or painted 

coated products 

hot rolled or cold rolled steel can be coated with zinc to render it corrosionresistant and to improve its paintability galvanized galvannealed galvalume electrogalvanized and aluminized products are types of coated steels these are also the highest valueadded sheet products because they require the greatest degree of processing and tend to have the strictest quality requirements coated steel is used in high volume applications such as automobiles household appliances roofing and siding heating and air conditioning equipment air ducts switch boxes chimney flues awnings garbage cans and food containers 

structural steel market 

according to the steel manufacturers association in 2003 2004 and 2005 structural steel consumption was 68 million tons 68 million tons and 74 million tons respectively consumption of structural steel products is influenced both by new construction and manufacturing activity and by the selection of steel over alternative structural or manufacturing materials 

rail market 

domestic rail shipments in 2004 and 2005 were approximately 842000 tons and 803000 tons respectively including standard rail and premium or headhardened rail of the total shipments of rail during 2005 approximately 65 was produced by the two other us rail producers and approximately 35 was imported mainly from japan and from europe there are currently no rail producers in canada 

sbq markets 

according to aisi data apparent sbq supply has averaged approximately 7 million tons nationally over the 2000 to 2004 period according to the aisi apparent supply of light structural shapes also characterized by a major dimension of less than 3 inches averaged between 1 million and 2 million tons annually during the 2000 to 2004 period 

energy resources 

electricity 

we have entered into a fixed price interruptible electricity supply agreement that extends through december 31 2007 for our flat roll minimill in butler indiana the contract allows our supplier to interrupt service in the event of an emergency or in response to various market conditions 

our bar products mill purchased electricity pursuant to a market price supply agreement that extends through december 31 2006 and our structural and rail mill purchases electricity at spotmarket prices 

gas 

at our flat roll and structural and rail mills we purchase a portion of our natural gas requirements at market prices and a portion by entering into hedging transactions on the futures markets for ultimate physical delivery in order to help minimize price volatility 

we purchase natural gas for our bar products mill at market prices 

patents and trademarks 

we have four registered trademarks containing the mark “sdi” and a chevron one trademark is the mark “sdi” and a chevron alone the second trademark is the mark “sdi” and a chevron and “steel dynamics inc” to the right of the chevron the third trademark is the mark “sdi” and a chevron and “steel dynamics” to the right of the chevron the fourth trademark is the mark “sdi” and an accompanying design of a steel coil and a chevron our iron dynamics division has filed five patent applications with the us patent and trademark office relating to its methods of producing low sulfur liquid pig iron as of the date of this filing we have received three of those patents 

research and development 

our research and development efforts have consisted of efforts to develop or improve our operating practices and our efforts to develop and improve alternative ironmaking technologies through iron dynamics and our investment in mesabi nugget with the exception of mesabi nugget most of these research and development efforts have been conducted inhouse by steel dynamics’ officers and employees 

environmental matters 

our operations are subject to substantial and evolving local state and federal environmental health and safety laws and regulations concerning among other things emissions to the air discharges to surface and ground water and to sewer systems and the generation handling storage transportation treatment and disposal of toxic and hazardous substances in particular we are dependent upon both state and federal permits regulating discharges into the air or into the water in order to operate our facilities we 

believe that in all current respects our facilities are in material compliance with all provisions of federal and state laws concerning the environment and we do not currently believe that future compliance with such provisions will have a material adverse effect on our results of operations cash flows or financial condition 

since the level of enforcement of environmental laws and regulations or the nature of those laws that may be enacted from time to time are sometimes subject to changing social or political pressures our environmental capital expenditures and costs for environmental compliance may increase in the future in addition due to the possibility of unanticipated regulatory or other developments the amount and timing of future environmental expenditures may vary substantially from those currently anticipated the cost of current and future environmental compliance may also place us steel producers at a competitive disadvantage with respect to foreign steel producers which may not be required to undertake equivalent costs in their operations 

pursuant to the resource conservation and recovery act or rcra which governs the treatment handling and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes the united states environmental protection agency or us epa and authorized state environmental agencies conduct inspections of rcra regulated facilities to identify areas where there may have been releases of solid or hazardous constituents into the environment and require the facilities to take corrective action to remediate any such releases rcra also allows citizens to bring certain suits against regulated facilities for potential damages and clean up our steelmaking facilities are subject to rcra our manufacturing operations produce various byproducts some of which for example electric arc furnace or eaf dust are categorized as industrial or hazardous waste requiring special handling for disposal or for the recovery of metallics we collect such coproducts in approved baghouses and other facilities but we are also examining alternative reclamation technologies to recycle some of these products the iron dynamics scrap substitute process is an example of such an alternative while we cannot predict the future actions of the regulators or other interested parties the potential exists for required corrective action at these facilities the costs of which could be substantial 

under the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act or cercla the us epa and in some instances private parties have the authority to impose joint and several liability for the remediation of contaminated properties upon generators of waste current and former site owners and operators transporters and other potentially responsible parties regardless of fault or the legality of the original disposal activity many states including indiana have statutes and regulatory authorities similar to cercla and to the us epa we have a number of waste handling agreements with various contractors to properly dispose of our electric arc furnace dust and certain other waste products of steelmaking however we cannot assure you that even if there has been no fault by us we may not still be cited as a waste generator by reason of an environmental clean up at a site to which our waste products were transported 

in addition to rcra and cercla there are a number of other environmental health and safety laws and regulations that apply to our facilities and may affect our operations by way of example and not of limitation certain portions of the federal clean air act clean water act oil pollution act safe drinking water act and emergency planning and community righttoknow act as well as state and local laws and regulations implemented by the regulatory agencies apply to our facilities’ operations many of these laws allow both the governments and citizens to bring certain suits against regulated facilities for alleged environmental violations finally any steelmaking company could be subject to certain toxic tort suits brought by citizens or other third parties alleging causes of action such as nuisance negligence trespass infliction of emotional distress or other claims alleging personal injury or property damage 

employees 

our work force consisted of 1795 employees at december 31 2005 none of steel dynamics’ employees are currently represented by labor unions we believe that our relationship with our employees is good 




 item 1a   risk factors

our profitability is subject to the risks described under this section on “risk factors” described below although the following are not necessarily the only ones facing our company our business financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected by any of the following risks 

risks related to our industry 

in recent years imports of steel into the united states have adversely affected and may yet again adversely affect us steel prices which would impact our sales margins and profitability 

excessive imports of steel into the united states as a result of excess world supply have in recent years exerted and may again in the future exert downward pressure on us steel prices and significantly reduce our sales margins and profitability us steel producers compete with many foreign producers competition from foreign producers is typically strong is periodically exacerbated by weakening of the economies of certain foreign steelmaking countries and is further intensified during periods when the us dollar is strong relative to foreign currencies greater steel exports to the united states tend to occur at depressed prices when steel producing countries experience periods of economic difficulty decreased demand for steel products or excess capacity 

in addition we believe the downward pressure on and periodically depressed levels of us steel prices in some recent years have been further exacerbated by imports of steel involving dumping and subsidy abuses by foreign steel producers some foreign steel producers are owned controlled or subsidized by foreign governments as a result decisions by these producers with respect to their production sales and pricing are often influenced to a greater degree by political and economic policy considerations than by prevailing market conditions realities of the marketplace or consideration of profit or loss tariffs and quotas are currently in effect for various steel products imported from a number of countries that have been found to have been unfairly pricing steel imports to the us when these measures expire or if they are relaxed or repealed or if consistently higher us steel prices enable foreign steelmakers to export their steel products to the united states despite the presence of duties or tariffs the resurgence of substantial imports of foreign steel could again create downward pressure on us steel prices 

china’s current steelmaking overcapacity coupled with a reduction or slowdown in china’s steel consumption could have a material adverse effect on domestic and global steel pricing and could result in increased steel exports into the united states 

a significant factor in the worldwide strengthening of steel pricing over the past several years has been the explosive growth in chinese steel consumption which had until recently vastly outpaced that country’s capacity to produce steel in sufficient quantity to serve its internal demand particularly during 2004 the shortage of chinese domestic steel supply resulted not only in heightened chinese demand for imported steel and other raw materials with a consequent upward spiral in world wide steel pricing but also led to a rapid and significant expansion of steel production capacity in china that in addition to the existence of a large amount of outdated inefficient and government subsidized production capacity has resulted in a situation in which china’s steel producing capacity currently exceeds that country’s demand for certain steel products a combination of a slowdown in china’s economic growth rate and its consumption of steel coupled with its own expansion of steelmaking capacity has caused a reduction and could result in a substantial weakening of both domestic and global steel demand and steel pricing should chinese demand weaken china might not only become a net exporter of steel but many asian and european steel producers whose steel output currently feeds china’s steel import needs could find their way into the us market through increased steel imports thus causing an erosion of margins and a reduction in pricing 

domestic and worldwide consolidation in the steel industry and the emergence of more efficient integrated steel producers has eroded some of the historical cost advantages of minimills 

until recent years our primary competitors were other minimills which had cost structures and management cultures similar to ours and were more efficient and lower cost producers in many product areas than integrated mills however largely as a result of restructurings and consolidation within the us and worldwide steel industry and the resulting emergence of a number of integrated steel producers with lower capital costs new or renegotiated union work rules and labor costs the elimination or reduction of health care and pension legacy costs the introduction of more incentive based compensation and a more decentralized management structure some of these integrated producers now have cost structures that are much more competitive likewise with their lesser dependence on scrap as a component of their melt mix than minimills these producers may enjoy a raw material cost advantage over minimills during periods of high scrap costs the reduction in costs enjoyed by many integrated steel producers further increases the competitive environment in the steel industry and may contribute to future pricing pressures 

increases in prices and limited availability of raw materials and energy may constrain operation levels and reduce profit margins 

steel producers require large amounts of raw materials such as scrap steel producers also consume large amounts of energy over the last several years prices for raw materials and energy have increased significantly in many cases by a greater margin than corresponding price increases for the sale of steel products depending upon applicable raw material and energy prices over which we may have little control we and other steel producers may be faced in the future with difficulty in obtaining sufficient raw materials and energy in a timely manner or for reasonable costs resulting in potential production curtailments 

our level of production and our sales and earnings are subject to significant fluctuations as a result of the cyclical nature of the steel industry and the industries we serve particularly the auto industry 

the price of steel may fluctuate significantly due to many factors beyond our control this fluctuation directly affects our product mix production volumes and our sales and earnings the steel industry is highly cyclical and the sale of our products is directly affected by demand for our products in other highly cyclical industries such as the automotive oil and gas gas transmission residential and commercialindustrial construction commercial equipment rail transportation appliance agricultural and durable goods industries currently the domestic automotive industry which is a major consumer of new steel and a major generating of steel scrap is suffering from a substantial downturn and continued economic difficulties stagnant economies supplydemand imbalances and currency fluctuations in the united states or globally could further decrease the demand for our products or increase the amount of imports of steel into the united states which would decrease our sales margins and profitability we are also particularly sensitive to trends and events including strikes and labor unrest that may adversely impact these industries these industries are significant markets for our products and are themselves highly cyclical 

risks related to our business and our company 

we may encounter supply shortages and increases in the cost of raw materials energy and transportation 

steel production requires substantial amounts of raw materials and energy including steel scrap pig iron iron ore natural gas coal and other alloys or materials used in the process of making steel any prolonged interruption in the supply of raw materials or energy or substantial increases in their costs could adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations or prospects prices of raw materials have substantially increased over the past several years and may continue to increase the 

availability and prices of raw materials may be negatively affected by new laws or regulations allocation by suppliers interruptions in production accidents or natural disasters changes in exchange rates worldwide price fluctuations and the availability and cost of transportation 

energy costs including the cost of natural gas and electricity make up a substantial portion of the cost of goods sold by steel companies and the price of natural gas and electricity varies as a result of market conditions and other factors beyond the control of steel companies moreover global developments particularly the dramatic increase in the demand for raw materials including scrap and other inputs used in steel manufacturing from china and other asian countries have in the past caused shortages and may continue to cause severe shortages andor substantial price increases in key raw materials as well as in ocean transportation capacity and costs inability to recoup these cost increases from increases in the selling prices of steel products or the inability to pass all or any substantial part of these cost increases through scrap or other surcharges or the inability to provide for customers’ needs because of the potential unavailability of key raw materials or other inputs may have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations or prospects 

we may face significant price and other forms of competition from other steel producers which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operation or prospects 

the global markets in which steel companies conduct business are highly competitive and could become even more so due to increasing consolidation in the steel industry increased competition could cause us to lose market share increase operating costs or reduce pricing any one of which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations or prospects the global steel industry has historically suffered from substantial overcapacity and excess capacity exists in some of our product lines this could cause us to reduce prices for our products and as a result have a material adverse affect on our business financial condition results of operations or prospects we compete primarily on the basis of price quality and the ability to meet our customers’ product needs and delivery schedules some of our competitors may have advantages due to greater capital resources different technologies lower raw material costs lower energy costs or favorable exchange rates 

competition from other products may have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations or prospects 

in many applications steel competes with other materials such as aluminum and plastics particularly in the automobile industry cement composites glass and wood additional substitution of these or other substitutes for steel products could adversely affect future market prices and demand for steel products 

we may face risks associated with the implementation of our growth strategy 

our growth strategy subjects us to various risks as part of our growth strategy we have expanded and may further expand existing facilities build additional plants acquire other businesses and steel assets such as our anticipated acquisition of roanoke enter into joint ventures or form strategic alliances that we believe will complement our existing business these transactions will likely involve some or all of the following risks 

·   the difficulty of competing for acquisitions and other growth opportunities with companies having greater financial resources than ours

·   the difficulty of integrating the acquired operations and personnel into existing businesses

·   the potential disruption of ongoing businesses

·   the diversion of resources

·   the inability of management to maintain uniform standards controls procedures and policies

·   the difficulty of managing the growth of a larger company

·   the risk of entering markets in which we have little experience

·   the risk of becoming involved in labor commercial or regulatory disputes or litigation related to the new enterprise

·   the risk of contractual or operational liability to other venture participants or to third parties as a result of the participation by us

·   the inability to work efficiently with joint venture or strategic alliance partners and

·   the difficulties of terminating joint ventures or strategic alliances

there are risks associated with acquisitions 

the success of any future acquisition such as our anticipated acquisition of roanoke will depend substantially on our ability to integrate the acquired operations successfully with our existing operations in an efficient and effective manner if we are unable to integrate new operations successfully our financial results could suffer additional risks associated with acquisitions include the diversion of management’s attention from other business concerns the potential loss of key employees and customers of the acquired companies the potential assumption of unknown liabilities and the inherent risks in entering markets or lines of business in which we have limited or no prior experience 

equipment downtime or shutdowns could adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations or prospects 

steel manufacturing processes are dependent on critical steelmaking equipment such as furnaces continuous casters rolling mills and electrical equipment such as transformers and this equipment may incur downtime as a result of unanticipated failures or other events such as fires or furnace breakdowns as well as other unusual and unplanned maintenance requirements our manufacturing plants have experienced and may in the future experience plant shutdowns or periods of reduced production as a result of such equipment failures or other events these disruptions could have an adverse affect on our operations customer service levels and financial results 

environmental regulation imposes costs and limitations on our operations 

we are subject to the risk of environmental liability and limitations on our operations brought about by the requirements of environmental laws and regulations we are subject to various federal state and local environmental health and safety laws and regulations concerning such issues as air emissions wastewater discharges solid and hazardous materials and waste handling and disposal and the investigation and remediation of contamination these laws and regulations are increasingly stringent while we believe that our facilities are and will continue to be in material compliance with all applicable environmental laws and regulations the risks of substantial costs and liabilities related to compliance with these laws and regulations are an inherent part of the business and it is possible that future conditions may develop arise or be discovered that create substantial environmental remediation liabilities and costs for example steelmaking operations produce some waste products such as electric arc furnace dust which are classified as hazardous waste and must be properly disposed of under applicable environmental laws these laws can impose clean up liability on generators of hazardous waste and other substances that are shipped offsite for disposal regardless of fault or the legality of the disposal activities other laws may require us to investigate and remediate contamination at our properties including contamination that was caused in whole or in part by third parties while we believe we can comply with environmental legislation 

and regulatory requirements and that the costs of doing so have been included within budgeted cost estimates it is possible that this compliance will prove to be more limiting and costly than anticipated 

in addition to potential clean up liability in the past we have been and in the future may become subject to monetary fines and penalties for violation of applicable laws regulations or administrative conditions we may also be subject from time to time to legal proceedings brought by private parties or governmental agencies with respect to environmental matters including matters involving alleged property damage or personal injury 

technology operating and startup risks associated with our scrap substitute projects such as our iron dynamics project and our mesabi nugget joint venture may prevent us from realizing the anticipated benefits from one or both of these projects and could result in a loss of currently invested funds as well as future required funding for the ongoing operation of iron dynamics and the commercialization of the nugget project 

if we should abandon or substantially reduce the scope of our ongoing iron dynamics project we will not be able to realize the expected benefits of this project and could suffer the loss of all or a substantial part of our entire investment as of december 31 2005 investment in the iron dynamics project was approximately 190 million since 1997 we have been involved in the development and commercialization of a pioneering process of producing a form of iron to serve as a lower cost substitute for a portion of the metallic raw material mix that goes into the flat roll division’s electric arc furnaces to be melted into new steel this scrap substitute project involves processes that are based on various technical assumptions and new applications of technologies that have yet to be fully commercially proven the iron dynamics project has taken considerably longer and has required us to expend considerably greater resources than originally anticipated 

while we remain optimistic that certain continuing operational difficulties with the equipment technology systems and processes can be resolved the iron dynamics facility may not be able to consistently operate or be able to produce steel scrap substitute material whether direct reduced iron hot briquetted iron or liquid pig iron in the quantities and for costs that will enable it to be cost competitive with scrap or with purchased pig iron moreover the iron dynamics facility may experience additional shutdowns or equipment failures 

we also plan to invest approximately 30 million over the next year in mesabi nugget a joint venture with kobe steel ltd clevelandcliffs inc and ferrometrics inc to build an iron nugget plant using kobe’s proprietary itmk3® process we and our other joint venture partners have successfully built and operated a small scale pilot project using this process however while we believe that a full scale commercial plant should work as well as the pilot project and that when built it should be capable of consistently producing iron nuggets in sufficient quantities and with a cost structure that will compare favorably with the cost of scrap and of other scrap substitute products including pig iron there can be no assurance that these expectations can be achieved if mesabi nugget encounters cost overruns construction delays or systems or process difficulties during or after startup the anticipated capital and other costs could materially increase the expected operating cost benefits from the development of the iron nugget product could be diminished or lost and we could also lose our investment in the project 

our senior secured credit agreement the indenture relating to its 9½ senior unsecured notes due 2009 and the indenture relating to its 4 convertible subordinated notes due 2012 contain restrictive covenants that may independently limit our flexibility 

restrictions and covenants in our existing debt agreements including our senior secured credit agreement the indenture relating to our 9½ senior unsecured notes due 2009 and the indenture relating to our 4 convertible subordinated notes due 2012 and any future financing agreements may impair our 

ability to finance future operations or capital needs or to engage in other business activities specifically these agreements restrict our ability to 

·   incur additional indebtedness

·   pay dividends or make distributions with respect to our capital stock

·   repurchase or redeem capital stock

·   make certain investments

·   create liens and enter into sale and leaseback transactions

·   make certain capital expenditures

·   enter into transactions with affiliates or related persons

·   issue or sell stock of certain subsidiaries

·   sell or transfer assets and

·   participate in some joint ventures acquisitions or mergers

a breach of any of the restrictions or covenants in one or more of these debt agreements could cause a default under our senior secured credit agreement other debt or the notes and a significant portion of our indebtedness may become immediately due and payable we are in compliance with these restrictions and covenants at february 28 2006 and expect to remain in compliance during the next twelve months 

our stock price may be volatile and could decline substantially 

our stock price may decline substantially as a result of the volatile nature of the stock market and other factors beyond our control many factors may cause the market price of our common stock to decline including 

·   the failure of operating results to meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors in any quarter

·   downward revisions in securities analyst estimates of our earnings or of general market or economic conditions

·   consolidation by other competitors in the industry

·   speculation regarding potential acquisitions or takeovers

·   material company or industry announcements by us or our competitors

·   market perceptions concerning the steel cycle and our future earnings prospects

·   sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock

·   governmental regulatory action or

·   adverse changes in general market conditions or economic trends

shares eligible for public sale could adversely affect our stock price 

the future sale of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market or the perception that these sales could occur could significantly reduce our stock price it could also make it more difficult for us to raise funds through equity offerings in the future as of march 6 2006 we had 43644062 shares of our common stock outstanding this number does not include the 6762874 shares of 

common stock that are issuable upon conversion of our 4 convertible subordinated notes due 2012 our anticipated issuance of approximately 4459100 shares to roanoke electric steel shareholders in the pending merger or approximately 1553126 shares reserved as of december 31 2005 for issuance in connection with outstanding stock options or incentive plans in addition large institutions or other holders may from time to time take positions in or in derivative securities representing shares of our common stock all of these shares are or when issued would be eligible for public sale and if sold in substantial amounts in relation to demand for our shares could result in a decline in our stock price 

we may not continue to pay cash dividends in the future 

from the time of our initial public offering in 1996 through june 2004 we did not declare cash or other dividends on our common stock both in july and october 2004 we paid a cash dividend of 7½ cents per share and for the fourth quarter of 2004 increased the quarterly cash dividend to 10 cents per share we paid cash dividends of 10 cents per share for each quarter of 2005 and we recently announced a regular 10 cent dividend and a special 10 cent dividend for the first quarter of 2006 and our expectation to continue both for the balance of 2006 we cannot assure you however that we will continue to pay cash dividends or if we do that we will do so at the current rate we may elect at any time to retain all future earnings for use in the operation of our business and to fund future growth moreover the terms of our senior secured credit agreement and the indenture relating to our senior notes impose specified restrictions on our ability to pay cash dividends even if these restrictions are removed any future cash dividends will depend upon our results of operations financial condition cash requirements and other factors

operations 

we are one of the largest steel producers in the united states based on an estimated annual steelmaking capability of 42 million tons with 2005 consolidated shipments totaling 36 million tons we produce steel principally from steel scrap using electric arc melting furnaces continuous casting and automated rolling mills our operations are currently comprised of the following three primary steelmaking facilities 

·   our flat roll division which produces flat roll sheet steel and sells a broad range of hot rolled cold rolled and coated steel products including a large variety of specialty products such as thinner gauge hot rolled galvanized and painted products

·   our structural and rail division which produces and sells structural steel beams pilings and other steel components this facility is also designed to produce and sell a variety of standard and premiumgrade rail for the railroad industry this division shipped limited amounts of industrialquality rail throughout 2005 and anticipates shipping standard rail during the first half of 2006

·   our bar products division which produces and sells special barquality and merchant barquality rounds and roundcornered squares and limited amounts of rebar

our steel operating divisions sell directly to endusers and service centers our products are used in numerous industry sectors including the automotive construction commercial transportation and industrial machinery markets 

we also have other operations which include a scrap substitute manufacturing facility referred to as iron dynamics two steel fabrication facilities which produce trusses girders steel joists and steel decking referred to as new millennium building systems and a 50owned trading and processing facility that receives revenue from the further processing or slitting and sale of certain secondary and excess prime steel products 

income statement classifications 

net sales   our total net sales are a factor of net tons shipped product mix and related pricing our net sales are determined by subtracting product returns sales discounts return allowances and claims from total sales we charge premium prices for certain grades of steel dimensions of product or certain smaller volumes based on our cost of production we also charge marginally higher prices for our valueadded products these products include hot rolled and cold rolled galvanized products cold rolled products and 

painted products from our flat roll division and certain special bar quality products from our bar products division 

costs of goods sold   our costs of goods sold represents all direct and indirect costs associated with the manufacture of our products the principal elements of these costs are steel scrap and scrap substitutes alloys natural gas argon direct and indirect labor and related benefits electricity oxygen electrodes depreciation materials and transportation and freight our metallic raw materials steel scrap and scrap substitutes represent the most significant component of our costs of goods sold

selling general and administrative expenses   selling general and administrative expenses consist of all costs associated with our sales finance and accounting and administrative departments these costs include labor and benefits professional services financing cost amortization property taxes profitsharing expense and startup costs associated with new projects

interest expense   interest expense consists of interest associated with our senior credit facilities and other debt agreements as described in the notes to our financial statements net of capitalized interest costs that are related to construction expenditures during the construction period of capital projects

other income expense   other income consists of interest income earned on our cash balances and any other nonoperating income activity including gains on certain shortterm investments other expense consists of any nonoperating costs

operating results 2005 vs 2004 

net income was 2218 million or 435 per diluted share during 2005 compared with 2953 million or 527 per diluted share during 2004 when compared to 2004 our 2005 average consolidated selling price per ton shipped decreased 17 we experienced a compression of 6 in our gross margin percentage not only due to reduced product pricing but also due to increased costs associated with our manufacturing processes caused by a change in the types of products produced and higher energy costs 

gross profit   during 2005 our net sales increased slightly to 22 billion while our consolidated shipments increased 162000 tons or 5 to 36 million tons when compared to 2004 the increase in shipments was primarily due to increased shipments of 93000 tons from our structural and rail division as a result of increased demand for structural products for the commercial construction industry and 39000 tons from our bar products division as a result of the division’s continued efforts to penetrate the specialbarquality market the specialbarquality market is dominated by longterm customer supply contracts our bar products division started operations in january 2004 and since that time has been selling into the spotmarket and commissioning various products for customer testing and certification to develop customer relationships and pursue longterm customer supply contracts the bar products division will be completing construction of a bar finishing facility during the first quarter of 2006 to add processing and inspection capabilities critical to developing longer term supply arrangements

as depicted by the following graph our fourth quarter of 2005 average consolidated selling price per ton shipped decreased 91 compared with the fourth quarter of 2004 and increased 79 compared with the third quarter of 2005 currently we have orders for the first quarter of 2006 that suggest we will achieve slightly higher average selling prices than experienced during the fourth quarter of 2005 domestic demand for flat rolled products was weaker than expected during the first half of 2005 due to excessive inventories at steel service centers and end users inventories declined through the first half and the market for flat rolled products improved early in the second half and stabilized through yearend scrap prices fluctuated significantly through the year but did not reach the historic highs seen in 2004 nonresidential construction activity improved throughout 2005 resulting in stronger demand for structural steel fabricated steel joists and decking and flat rolled steel products 

the following table depicts our product mix by major product category based on tons shipped for the indicated periods generally we incur higher production costs when manufacturing valueadded products such as cold rolled galvanized and painted flat roll steels and specialbarquality steels during 2005 we also experienced an increase in electricity and natural gas costs combined electricity and natural gas costs were 9 and 8 of total costs of goods sold during 2005 and 2004 respectively however these costs increased to 11 of our total costs of goods sold during the second half of 2005 as energy costs increased and as some of our previously hedged gas positions expired at lower costs given our existing hedged position and current market dynamics we expect to continue to experience somewhat higher natural gas costs however we have experienced a moderation in the costs from the highs realized in the third quarter of 2005 and we do not expect this to have a material adverse impact on our results of operations in 2006 as natural gas consumption is a much less significant component in the production of steel through electric arc furnace operations such as ours than in traditional steel manufacturing blast furnace operations 

 

 indicates shipments of less than 1 

metallic raw materials used in our electric arc furnaces represent our most significant manufacturing cost our metallic raw material cost per net ton consumed decreased 19 during 2005 as compared to 2004 historically our metallic raw material costs represented between 45 and 50 of our total manufacturing 

costs however during the last two years this percentage has increased to 56 and 65 during 2004 and 2005 respectively as the industry has experienced historically high steel scrap prices this increase in the cost of our primary raw material as a percentage of our total manufacturing costs necessitated the initiation of a surcharge mechanism which was adopted by the steel industry during the first quarter of 2004 the surcharge is derived from an indexed scrap number and designed to pass some of the increased costs associated with rising metallic prices to our customers as these costs decrease the surcharge also declines during a portion of the second and third quarters of 2005 steel scrap prices were below the indexed surcharge numbers and in some instances no surcharge was utilized in determining prices for our products during the fourth quarter of 2005 our metallic raw material cost per net ton consumed increased 41 as compared to the third quarter and surcharges were utilized we anticipate relatively flat metallic raw material consumption costs during the first quarter of 2006 on a linkedquarter comparison 

selling general and administrative expenses   selling general and administrative expenses were 920 million during 2005 as compared to 966 million during 2004 a decrease of 46 million or 5 our total selling general and administrative expenses represented 4 and 5 of net sales during 2005 and 2004 respectively included in our selling general and administrative expenses are costs related to our performancebased profit sharing plan which is based on 6 of pretax earnings and totaled 230 million and 287 million during 2005 and 2004 respectively

interest expense   during 2005 gross interest expense decreased 108 million or 23 to 351 million and capitalized interest decreased 62 million to 730000 as compared to 2004 this decrease in gross interest expense was the result of interest expense of 60 million that was recorded during 2004 in conjunction with a onetime shortterm us treasury bond transaction the interest capitalization that occurred during these periods resulted from the interest required to be capitalized with respect to construction activities at our bar products division and structural  rail division we currently anticipate gross interest expense to remain relatively consistent with 2005 levels throughout the next twelve months

other income expense   other income was 18 million during 2005 as compared to 70 million during 2004 during the third quarter of 2005 we recorded gains of 13 million from the sale of certain equity securities during the first quarter of 2004 we entered into a shortterm us treasury bond transaction to generate net interest income in an increasing interest rate environment and to generate capital gains this transaction was completed during the fourth quarter and we recorded associated gains of 54 million during 2004

income taxes   during 2005 our income tax provision was 1388 million as compared to 1797 million during the same period in 2004 our effective income tax rate was increased to 38 for the second half of 2004 due to increased profitability we further increased our effective income tax rate to 385 beginning january 1 2005 in anticipation of the year’s expected profitability levels and the resulting impact to our state income taxes we currently expect the effective income tax rate to remain at 385 for 2006

operating results 2004 vs 2003 

net income was 2953 million or 527 per diluted shared during 2004 compared with 471 million or 91 per diluted share during 2003 this increase in our net income during 2004 was due to increased selling values and shipping volumes 

gross profit   during 2004 our net sales increased 12 billion or 117 to 21 billion and our consolidated shipments increased 615000 tons or 22 to 34 million tons compared with 2003 the increase in consolidated shipments was primarily due to increased shipments to external customers of 316000 tons from our bar products division which started commercial operations during the first quarter of 2004 and an increase of 268000 tons from our structural and rail division which completed its second full year of operations our average consolidated selling price for 2004 increased 79 to 625 per ton compared with 2003 we experienced an increase in demand and product basepricing during 2004 however our increase in selling values during that time was also due in part to the steel industry’s initiation of a surcharge mechanism at the beginning of 2004 this surcharge is derived from an indexed scrap number and designed to pass some of the increased costs associated with rising metallic prices through to the industry’s customers

our average annual 2004 metallic raw material cost per net ton charged increased 115 when compared with 2003 metallic raw materials specifically steel scrap and scrap substitutes represent the most significant cost component of our steel operation’s production processes as a percentage of total costs of goods sold during 2004 these costs represented 65 an increase of 13 compared with 2003 this increase in the cost of our primary raw material as a percentage of our total manufacturing costs necessitated the surcharge 

selling general and administrative expenses   selling general and administrative expenses were 966 million during 2004 as compared to 487 million during 2003 an increase of 479 million or 98 this increase was primarily attributed to increased profit sharing and bonus compensation expense of 277 million which correlates to the increase in our pretax earnings our profit sharing pool is calculated as a percentage of our pretax earnings during 2003 and the first half of 2004 the profit sharing pool was based on 5 of pretax earnings during the second half of 2004 upon approval of our board of directors the allocation was increased to 6 during 2004 and 2003 selling general and administrative expense represented 5 of net sales

interest expense   during 2004 gross interest expense increased 8 to 458 million and capitalized interest decreased 885000 to 69 million as compared to 2003 during 2004 we recorded interest expense of 60 million in conjunction with a onetime shortterm us treasury bond transaction the interest capitalization that occurred during 2004 resulted from the interest required to be capitalized with respect to construction activities at our bar products and structural and rail divisions

other income expense   other income was 70 million during 2004 as compared to other expense of 664000 during 2003 during the first quarter of 2004 we entered into a shortterm us treasury bond transaction to generate net interest income in an increasing interest rate environment and to generate capital gains this transaction was completed during the fourth quarter and we recorded associated gains of 54 million during 2004 we also recorded a 10 million gain from the early extinguishment of debt associated with our structural and rail division during the second quarter of 2004

income taxes   during 2004 our income tax provision was 1797 million as compared to 283 million during 2003 our effective income tax rate was 375 throughout 2003 and for the first half of 2004 we fully utilized all of our existing net operating loss carryforwards and capital loss carryforwards during 2004 we increased our effective income tax rate to 380 effective july 1 2004 due to increased profitability during the year

liquidity and capital resources 

our business is capital intensive and requires substantial expenditures for among other things the purchase and maintenance of equipment used in our steelmaking and finishing operations and to remain in compliance with environmental laws our shortterm and longterm liquidity needs arise primarily from capital expenditures working capital requirements and principal and interest payments related to our outstanding indebtedness we have met these liquidity requirements with cash provided by operations equity longterm borrowings state and local grants and capital cost reimbursements 

working capital   during 2005 our operational working capital position representing our cash invested in trade receivables and inventories less trade payables and accruals increased 265 million to 4354 million compared to december 31 2004 due to decreased selling prices trade receivables decreased 122 million or 5 during 2005 to 2417 million of which 98 were current or less than 60 days past due our largest customer is an affiliated company heidtman steel which represented 16 and 15 of our outstanding trade receivables at december 31 2005 and 2004 respectively during 2005 our inventories increased 172 million or 5 to 3987 million raw materials and supplies increased 338 million while finished goods inventories decreased 210 million the increase in raw material and supplies was driven by the increased costs and volumes of alloys required as product diversification increases at our bar products division and by the addition of inventories at our new millennium lake city florida plant which began operations during the first quarter of 2005 the decrease in our finished goods inventories resulted from record shipments at our structural  rail division which reduced finished goods inventories by 76000 tons or 57 during 2005 our trade payables and accruals decreased 214 million or 9 during 2005 due to the timing of funding certain payables

capital expenditures   during 2005 we invested 634 million in property plant and equipment of which 180 million or 28 related to the expansion of our joist and deck operations and the remainder represented improvement projects for our existing facilities we believe these capital investments will increase our net sales and related cash flows as each project develops

capital resources   during 2005 our total outstanding debt including unamortized bond premium decreased 78 million to 4406 million our longterm debt to capitalization ratio representing our longterm debt divided by the sum of our longterm debt and our total stockholders’ equity was 33 and 34 at december 31 2005 and 2004 respectively

longterm debt   on september 7 2005 we replaced our 230 million 4year revolving credit facility with a new 5year 350 million senior secured revolving credit facility which includes a provision to increase the new facility by as much as 100 million under certain circumstances the proceeds from the revolver will be available for working capital and other general corporate purposes including merger and acquisition activity as a result of this refinancing we expensed 19 million of previously capitalized financing costs associated with the refinanced debt and capitalized 17 million in costs associated with the 

new facility at december 31 2005 and 2004 there were no outstanding borrowings under the then existing revolving credit facilities 

the senior secured credit agreement is secured by substantially all of our and our whollyowned subsidiaries receivables and inventories and by pledges of all shares of capital stock and intercompany debt held by us and each of our whollyowned subsidiaries the senior secured credit agreement contains financial covenants and other covenants that limit or restrict our ability to make capital expenditures incur indebtedness permit liens on property enter into transactions with affiliates make restricted payments or investments enter into mergers acquisitions or consolidations conduct asset sales pay dividends or distributions and enter into other specified transactions and activities our ability to borrow funds within the terms of the revolver is dependent upon our continued compliance with the financial covenants and other covenants contained in the senior secured credit agreement we were in compliance with these covenants at december 31 2005 and expect to remain in compliance during the next twelve months 

due to the increasing interest rate environment during 2005 and anticipated in 2006 we entered into three forward interest rate agreements during 2005 to lock the sixmonth libor inarrears setting of our 200 million fair value interest rate swap through march 15 2006 we recorded gains of 10 million during 2005 as a result of these contracts being recorded at fair market value at december 31 2005 one forward interest rate agreement remained in place locking the sixmonth libor inarrears setting at 41 through march 15 2006 

share repurchases   on april 20 2005 we announced the approval of our board of directors to increase the shares available for the company to repurchase from 5 million shares to 75 million shares pursuant to the 2004 share repurchase program at september 30 2005 we had repurchased the entire 75 million shares of which 59 million shares were purchased during 2005 pursuant to the program in the open market at an average price of 32 per share

announced merger   on october 18 2005 we announced the execution of a definitive agreement to merge with roanoke electric steel corporation pursuant to the merger agreement roanoke stockholders will receive a fixed consideration equal to 400 shares of our common stock plus 975 in cash for each share of roanoke stock outstanding at the effective date of the merger at february 14 2006 roanoke had 11354401 shares outstanding we plan to use current cash reserves to fund the cash portion of this acquisition completion of the merger is subject to roanoke stockholder approvals certain regulatory approvals and the satisfaction or waiver of customary conditions the definitive merger agreement contains certain termination rights for both parties including a provision for a termination fee of 75 million plus expenses to be paid to us if the transaction is terminated under certain circumstances

roanoke has steel manufacturing facilities in roanoke virginia and huntington west virginia these facilities produce angles rounds flats channels beams special sections and billets which are sold to steel service centers fabricators original equipment manufacturers and other steel producers roanoke also has subsidiaries involved in steel fabrication including steel joist and truck trailer beams and has two steel scrap processing locations 

other   our ability to meet our debt service obligations and reduce our total debt will depend upon our future performance which in turn will depend upon general economic financial and business conditions along with competition legislation and regulation factors that are largely beyond our control in addition we cannot assure you that our operating results cash flow and capital resources will be sufficient for repayment of our indebtedness in the future we believe that based upon current levels of operations and anticipated growth cash flow from operations together with other available sources of funds including additional borrowings under our senior secured credit agreement will be adequate for the next two years for making required payments of principal and interest on our indebtedness funding working capital requirements and funding anticipated capital expenditures

during 2006 we currently anticipate spending approximately 100 million on capital improvement projects at our existing facilities and on among others the following capital projects approximately 40 million in connection with an addition of a paint line at our jeffersonville galvanizing facility 15 million in connection with construction of a bar finishing facility at our bar products division 15 million in connection with construction of a rail welding facility at our structural and rail division and 30 million of various smaller individual projects at our existing operations these amounts do not include capital requirements that may arise from our involvement in new joint ventures or merger and acquisition activity that may occur throughout the year 

during 2005 we received benefits from state and local governments in the form of real estate and personal property tax abatements and credits of approximately 63 million based on our current abatements and incentive credits and utilizing our existing longlived asset structure we estimate the remaining annual effect on future operations to be approximately 54million 49 million 41 million 34 million 19 million 15 million 13 million 153000 and 92000 during the years 2006 through 2014 respectively 

contractual obligations and other longterm liabilities 

we have the following minimum commitments under contractual obligations including purchase obligations as defined by the us securities and exchange commission a “purchase obligation” is defined as an agreement to purchase goods or services that is enforceable and legally binding and that specifies all significant terms including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased fixed minimum or variable price provisions and the approximate timing of the transaction other longterm liabilities are defined as longterm liabilities that are reflected on our balance sheet under generally accepted accounting principles based on this definition the following table includes only those contracts which include fixed or minimum obligations it does not include normal purchases which are made in the ordinary course of business the following table provides aggregated information about outstanding contractual obligations and other longterm liabilities as of december 31 2005 dollars in thousands 

 

1   the longterm debt payment information presented above assumes that our senior unsecured notes and our convertible subordinated notes remain outstanding until maturity the earliest dates at which redemption or repurchase may occur for our 300 million senior unsecured notes is march 15 2006 and for our 115 million convertible subordinated notes is december 18 2007 refer to note 3 to the consolidated financial statements elsewhere in this report for additional information regarding our longterm debt

2   the estimated interest payments shown above assume interest rates of 95 on our 300 million senior unsecured notes due march 15 2009 40 on our 115 million convertible subordinated notes due december 15 2012 and 69 on our other fixed rate debt of approximately 201 million

3   purchase obligations include commitments we have for the purchase of natural gas and its transportation to be utilized within our production process these arrangements have “take or pay” or 

other similar commitment provisions we have fully utilized all such “take or pay” requirements during the past three years under these contracts 

4   construction commitments relate to firm contracts we have with various vendors for the completion of certain construction projects at our various divisions at december 31 2005

other matters 

inflation 

we believe that inflation has not had a material effect on our results of operations 

environmental and other contingencies 

we have incurred and in the future will continue to incur capital expenditures and operating expenses for matters relating to environmental control remediation monitoring and compliance during 2005 we incurred costs related to the monitoring and compliance of environmental matters in the amount of 154 million and capital expenditures related to environmental compliance of 215000 approximately 65 of the costs incurred during 2005 for monitoring and compliance were related to the normal transportation of certain types of waste produced in the steelmaking process in accordance with legal requirements no environmental remediation costs were incurred during 2005 and there were no outstanding contingent matters related to environmental remediation therefore there were no related accruals recorded at december 31 2005 we believe apart from our dependence on environmental construction and operating permits for our existing and proposed manufacturing facilities that compliance with current environmental laws and regulations is not likely to have a materially adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or liquidity however environmental laws and regulations have changed rapidly in recent years and we may become subject to more stringent environmental laws and regulations in the future 

recent accounting pronouncements and developments 

in note 1 to our consolidated financial statements we discuss new accounting policies adopted by steel dynamics during 2005 and the expected financial impact of accounting policies recently issued or proposed but not yet required to be adopted 

in december 2004 the fasb issued fas no 123r fas 123r “sharebased payments” fas 123r requires companies to recognize the cost of employee services received in exchange for awards of equity instruments such as our employee stock option plans as an expense in the financial statements based on our preliminary research and evaluations we believe that our adoption of fas 123r on january 1 2006 will result in a reduction of first quarter net earnings by approximately 820000 or 02 per diluted share 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

management’s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america we review the accounting policies we use in reporting our financial results on a regular basis the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities we evaluate the appropriateness of these estimations and judgments on an ongoing basis we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not 

readily apparent from other sources results may differ from these estimates due to actual outcomes being different from those on which we based our assumptions we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 

revenue recognition and allowance for doubtful accounts   we recognize revenues from sales and the allowance for estimated costs associated with returns from these sales when the title of the product transfers upon shipment provision is made for estimated product returns and customer claims based on estimates and actual historical experience if the historical data used in our estimates does not reflect future returns and claims trends additional provision may be necessary our steel joist and steel decking operation new millennium building systems recognizes revenues from construction contracts on a percentage of completion method based on steel consumed to date as a percentage of the estimated total steel required for each contract new millennium accounted for 6 of our 2005 net sales

we are exposed to credit risk in the event of nonpayment by our customers which are principally intermediate steel processors and service centers that sell our products to numerous industry sectors including the automotive construction commercial transportation and industrial machinery markets we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments based on known credit risks historical loss experience and current economic conditions affecting our customers we mitigate our exposure to credit risk by performing ongoing credit evaluations and taking further action when necessary such as requiring letters of credit or other security interests to support the receivable from our customer if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate resulting in the impairment of their ability to make payments additional allowance may be required 

impairments of longlived assets   in accordance with the methodology described in fasb statement no 144 “accounting for the impairment or disposal of longlived assets” we review longlived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable impairment losses are recorded on longlived assets used in operations when indicators of impairment are present and the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than the assets’ carrying amounts the impairment loss is measured by comparing the fair value of the asset to its carrying amount

deferred tax assets and liabilities   we are required to estimate our income taxes as a part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements this requires us to estimate our actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatments of items for tax and accounting purposes these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities which are included within our consolidated balance sheet we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely we must establish a valuation allowance




 item 7a   quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk

market risk 

in the normal course of business we are exposed to interest rate changes our objectives in managing exposure to interest rate changes are to limit the impact of these rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower overall borrowing costs to achieve these objectives we primarily use interest rate swaps to manage net exposure to interest rate changes related to our portfolio of borrowings we generally maintain fixed rate debt as a percentage of our net debt between a minimum and maximum percentage a portion of our debt has an interest component that resets on a periodic basis to reflect current market conditions the following table represents the principal cash repayments and related weightedaverage interest rates by maturity date for our longterm debt as of december 31 2005 in thousands 

 

  

commodity risk 

in the normal course of business we are exposed to the market risk and price fluctuations related to the sale of steel products and to the purchase of commodities used in our production process such as metallic raw materials electricity natural gas and alloys our risk strategy associated with product sales has generally been to obtain competitive prices for our products and to allow operating results to reflect market price movements dictated by supply and demand during 2005 approximately 10 of our net sales were under fixedprice contracts with greater than twelve month commitments 

our risk strategy associated with the purchase of commodities utilized within our production process has generally been to make certain commitments with suppliers relating to future expected requirements for such commodities certain of these commitments contain provisions which require us to “take or pay” for specified quantities without regard to actual usage for periods of up to 3 years during the years ending december 31 2006 2007 and 2008 we have commitments for natural gas and its transportation with “take or pay” or other similar commitment provisions for approximately 255 million 74 million and 53 million respectively we fully utilized all such “take or pay” requirements during the past three years and purchased 366 million 205 million and 169 million during the years ended december 31 2005 2004 and 2003 respectively under these contracts we believe that our production requirements will be such that consumption of the products or services purchased under these commitments will occur in the normal production process 

we also purchase electricity consumed at our flat roll division pursuant to a contract which extends through december 2007 the contract designates 180 hours annually as “interruptible service” and establishes an agreed fixed rate energy charge per millkwh consumed for each year through the expiration of the agreement

 item 1 business 

tableend   we are a steel manufacturing company that owns and operates three steelmaking minimills we produce our steel principally from steel scrap using electric arc melting furnaces continuous casting and automated rolling mills 

steel dynamics inc was incorporated in august 1993 in indiana we maintain our principal executive offices at 6714 pointe inverness way suite 200 fort wayne indiana 46804 our telephone number is 260 4593553 

back to contents 

during 2004 our sales were 21 billion and at yearend we had 1645 employees none of our employees are represented by labor unions 

 we own and operate a flat roll minimill located in butler indiana which produces sheet steel and which we built and have operated since 1996 currently this mill has an annual production capacity of approximately 24 million tons of flatrolled steel we produced 24 million tons at this facility during 2004 we produce a broad range of high quality hotrolled coldrolled and coated steel products including a large variety of high valueadded and high margin specialty products such as thinner gauge rolled products and galvanized products we sell our flatrolled products directly to endusers intermediate steel processors and service centers primarily in the midwestern united states our products are used in numerous industry sectors including the automotive construction and commercial industries 

in november 2003 we completed construction of our new 25 million inplant painting facility at our butler minimill and commenced coating operations this facility has an annual production capacity to coat approximately 240000 tons of steel during 2004 we painted 199000 tons of flatrolled steel products at this facility 

in march 2003 we also purchased the assets of a coating facility formerly owned by galvpro ii llc in jeffersonville indiana for a purchase price of 19 million this facility has a production capacity of between 300000 and 350000 tons per year of lightgauge hot dipped coldrolled galvanized steel we operate this new facility as a part of our flat roll division which also supplies the jeffersonville plant with steel coils for coating production began at jeffersonville in july 2003 during 2004 we produced 257000 tons of coated products at this facility our new jeffersonville facility together with our new painting facility have enabled us to further increase the mix of highermargin valueadded downstream steel products 

 we also own and operate a structural steel and rail minimill in columbia city indiana we began construction in may 2001 completed plant construction in april 2002 and commenced commercial structural steel operations during the third quarter of 2002 our columbia city minimill is designed to have an annual production capacity depending on the product mix of up to 12 million tons of structural steel beams pilings and other steel components for the construction transportation and industrial machinery markets as well as standard and premium grade rails for the railroad industry through regular product introductions and continued production rampup of structural steel products we were able to begin to offer a broad array of wide flange beams and hpiling structural steel products during 2003 and were able to commission all of the wide flange beam sizes of products we expect to offer save for 6 inch and 36 inch beams we commissioned all of the 36 inch beam sizes during 2004 and we offered these for sale during the first quarter of 2005 we expect our 6 inch beams to be available for sale during the second quarter of 2005 

with regard to our rail production facility we commissioned the casting and rolling equipment for the production of rail products during 2003 and in 2004 commissioned the rail finishing and inspection facility during subsequent 2004 rolling trials however we determined that the finished rail sections contained certain quality imperfections which we traced to the casting process while the resulting product was acceptable for industrial use it would not qualify for class i railroad use so we made necessary process and equipment modifications to address the problem ran confirmatory trials during the balance of 2004 and ordered and recently received new casting machine molds we believe that these deficiencies are fixable and that we will be able to produce class i quality standard rail during the second quarter of 2005 which we will provide to the railroad companies to be tested and monitored for product evaluation

 on september 6 2002 we purchased the special bar quality minimill assets in pittsboro indiana formerly owned by qualitech steel sbq llc we paid 45 million for these assets we have upgraded certain equipment and installed additional equipment to improve the efficiency of the pittsboro mill and to expand its product capabilities the mill is capable of producing a variety of merchant bar quality or mbq products such as angles flats rounds and other merchant bars and shapes as well as reinforcing bar or rebar products as well as special bar quality or sbq products at december 31 2004 we had invested a total of 1474 million in this facility which included capitalized interest of 66 million we started melting and casting operations in middecember and began shipping limited products by yearend 2003 during 2004 we produced approximately 337000 tons of which 308000 tons were sbq products to date we have produced very little mbq products and no smaller rounds angles flats channels and shapes the bar products division has an annual production capacity of between 500000 and 600000 tons 

 in november 2003 after making numerous changes to equipment and processes we recommenced operations at our iron dynamics ironmaking facility during december 2003 we produced 15000 tonnes of direct reduced iron which we then briquetted to form hot briquetted iron or hbi during 2004 we produced 173000 tonnes of direct reduced iron 106000 tonnes of which we converted into hbi and 47000 tonnes of which we converted into liquid pig iron in our submerged arc furnace we consumed all of the hbi and liquid pig iron produced by iron dynamics in our steelmaking operations 

 in march 2002 we formed a joint venture with certain entities owned by kobe steel ltd clevelandcliffs inc and ferrometrics inc to pursue the development of a proprietary technology owned by kobe known as “itmk3 ® ” for the production of a fully metallized iron nugget product suitable as an alternative iron or scrap substitute feedstock in electric arc furnace steelmaking the itmk3 ® process is a new ironmaking technology that uses a rotary hearth furnace to turn iron ore fines and pulverized coal into iron nuggets of comparable quality to blast furnace pig iron the itmk3 ® process is designed to complete reduction melting and slag reduction in approximately ten minutes we currently hold an approximate 19 equity interest in a pilot plant in minnesota the pilot plant began operations in may 2003 shipped its first iron nuggets to our flat roll mill in june 2003 which we used in our melt mix and successfully produced approximately 10000 tonnes of quality iron nuggets through the completion of test activities in july 2004 

based on the successful operation of the pilot plant we are planning to invest between 60 and 80 million over the next two years in a joint venture to build a fullscale commercial plant which will be located either in indiana or in minnesota we also anticipate entering into an offtake agreement with the joint venture for the iron nuggets to use as a raw material in our steelmaking operations 

 during 2003 we increased our ownership in our consolidated new millennium building systems subsidiary from 466 to 100 

the new millennium butler indiana facility which began production in june of 2000 produces steel building components including joists girders trusses and steel roof and floor decking which we sell primarily in the upper midwest nonresidential building components market our flat roll division supplies a majority of the hotrolled steel utilized in new millennium’s manufacturing operations during 2004 new millennium’s butler indiana facility which has an annual production capacity of approximately 100000 tons produced 96000 tons of steel building components

in september 2004 new millennium began construction of a new 270000 square foot manufacturing facility in lake city florida as of january 31 2005 we had invested 217 million in capital expenditures related to the expansion this plant began actual production of joists girders and trusses in february 2005 and will begin decking shipments in april 2005 the facility will manufacture a similar array of steel building components as our butler indiana facility but will market these products primarily to the nonresidential building components industry in florida and the southeastern united states we plan to supply our new florida plant with hotrolled steel from our flat roll division 

 on june 30 2004 we completed a refinancing of our senior secured credit facilities and entered into a new 4year 230 million senior secured revolving credit facility our senior secured credit agreement is secured by liens and mortgages on substantially all of our personal and real property assets by liens and mortgages on substantially all of the personal and real property assets of our whollyowned subsidiaries and by pledges of all shares of capital stock and intercompany debt held by us and each whollyowned subsidiary in addition our whollyowned subsidiaries have guaranteed our obligations under the senior secured credit agreement the senior secured credit agreement contains financial covenants and other covenants that limit or restrict our ability to make capital expenditures incur indebtedness permit liens on our property enter into transactions with affiliates make restricted payments or investments enter into mergers acquisitions or consolidations conduct asset sales pay dividends or distributions and enter into other specified transactions and activities our ability to draw down the revolver is dependent upon our continued compliance with the financial covenants and other covenants contained in our senior secured credit agreement we were in compliance with these covenants at december 31 2004 and expect to remain in compliance during the next twelve months as of december 31 2004 this facility was undrawn 

our new senior secured credit agreement allows us to pay cash dividends dependent upon our continued compliance with the financial covenants and other covenants within the agreement during the fourth quarter our board of directors declared our third cash dividend the dividend of 10 ten cents per common share was paid on january 17 2005 to shareholders of record at the close of business on december 31 2004 the aggregate dividend payment was 42 million on october 26 2004 we also announced our board of directors approved the repurchase of up to 5 million shares of our common stock to be made from time to time based upon the market price of our stock the nature of other investment opportunities present our cash flows from operations and general economic conditions we terminated our existing share repurchase plan and amended our senior secured credit facility as a result of this approval at december 31 2004 we had repurchased 16 million shares in the open market at an average price of 35 per share we repurchased an additional 10 million shares from january 4 2005 through january 26 2005 at an average of price of 35 per share we have approximately 24 million shares still authorized to be repurchased pursuant to our current share repurchase plan 

in march 2002 we issued 2000 million of 912 unsecured senior notes due 2009 and in november 2003 we issued an additional 1000 million of the same 912 unsecured senior notes due 2009 all 3000 million of these notes were outstanding as of december 31 2004 

during december 2002 and january 2003 we also issued 1150 million of our 4 convertible subordinated notes due 2012 the notes are convertible into approximately 6762874 shares of common stock initially issuable upon conversion of the notes under the terms of the convertible notes holders of the notes have the right to convert their notes into shares of our common stock at a conversion rate of 588076 shares per 1000 principal amount of notes equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately 170046 per share 

due to the increasing interest rate environment during 2004 and anticipated in 2005 we entered into two forward interest rate agreements during january 2005 to lock the sixmonth libor setting of our 200 million fair value interest rate swap which resets each march and september at sixmonth libor in arrears plus 57

we locked the sixmonth libor in arrears settings at 31 for the interest reset date of march 15 2005 and at 37 for the interest reset date of september 15 2005 

 we believe that we have the following competitive strengths 

 we believe that our facilities are among the lowestcost steel manufacturing facilities in the united states our low operating costs are primarily a result of our efficient plant designs and operations our high productivity rate of approximately 03 man hours per ton at our flat roll division’s minimill low ongoing maintenance cost requirements and strategic locations near sources of our primary raw material scrap steel 

 our senior management team is highly experienced and has a proven track record in the steel industry including pioneering the development of thinslab flatrolled technology their objectives are closely aligned with our stockholders through meaningful stock ownership positions and performancebased compensation programs our corporate culture is also unique for the steel industry we emphasize decentralized decisionmaking and have established incentive compensation programs specifically designed to reward employee teams for their efforts towards enhancing productivity improving profitability and controlling costs 

 our current products include hotrolled and coldrolled steel products galvanized sheet products light gauge steel products structural steel and rails and joists and deck materials we have broadened our offering of painted and coated products with the addition of our coil coating facility at our flat roll facility in butler and the addition of our jeffersonville indiana galvanizing facility we have entered the special bar quality or sbq market as well as the merchant bar or mbq market with an array of angles flats rounds reinforcing bar and other shapes through our bar products division in pittsboro indiana this diversified mix of products should enable us to access a broader range of enduser markets serve a broader customer base and mitigate our exposure to cyclical downturns in commodity grade flat rolled products or in any one product or enduser market 

 the strategic locations of our facilities near sources of scrap materials and our customer base allow us to realize significant pricing advantages due to freight savings for inbound scrap as well as for outbound steel products destined for our customers our minimills are located in the upper midwest a region which we believe accounts for a majority of the total scrap produced in the united states our jeffersonville indiana galvanizing facility on the ohio river also provides us with an expanded geographic reach to southern markets 

  the completion of our structural and rail division and the commencement of production at that facility the completion of our flat roll division coating facility and the expansion of production of coated products at that facility as well as our acquisitions of the pittsboro indiana bar mill and the jeffersonville indiana galvanizing facility are important steps in pursuing our strategy of product line expansion the structural and rail division is strategically located to serve the upper midwest northeast and canadian markets which we 

back to contents 

believe are attractive and underserved markets our strategy to expand our flat rolled steel product offerings is to focus on the production of high valueadded thinner gauge products galvanized products and various coated products the margins on high valueadded products typically exceed those of the commodity grade and the number of producers that make them is more limited our bar products division is likewise strategically located to position ourselves to costeffectively serve our markets we will continue to seek additional opportunities to further expand our range of high valueadded products through the expansion of existing facilities greenfield projects and acquisitions of other steel manufacturers or steelmaking assets that may become available through the continuing consolidation of the domestic steel industry 

 we may seek to enter new steel markets in strategic geographic locations such as the southeastern or western united states that offer attractive growth opportunities the greenfield expansion of our new millennium business now underway in lake city florida is an example of such a growth opportunity 

due to the ongoing restructuring and consolidation of the domestic steel industry we believe there are attractive opportunities to grow our business geographically through acquisitions of existing assets through strategic partnerships and alliances and through other greenfield projects 

 we are focused on continuing to maintain one of the lowest operating cost structures in the north american steel industry based upon operating cost per ton we will continue to optimize the use of our equipment enhance our productivity and explore new technologies to further improve our unit cost of production at each of our facilities 

 we intend to continue to foster our entrepreneurial corporate culture and emphasize decentralized decisionmaking while rewarding teamwork innovation and operating efficiency we will also continue to focus on maintaining the effectiveness of our incentive bonus based plans that are designed to enhance overall productivity and align the interests of our management and employees with our stockholders

 our profitability is subject to the risks described under this section on “risk factors” described below although the following are not necessarily the only ones facing our company our business financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected by any of the following risks 

  excessive imports of steel into the united states have in recent years exerted and may again in the future exert downward pressure on us steel prices and significantly reduce our sales margins and profitability us steel producers compete with many foreign producers competition from foreign producers is typically strong is periodically exacerbated by weakening of the economies of certain foreign steelmaking countries and is further intensified during periods when the us dollar is strong something which is not currently so relative to foreign currencies economic difficulties in these countries or a reduction in demand for steel produced by these countries when those events occur results in lower local demand for steel products in these countries and tends to encourage greater steel exports to the united states at depressed prices 

in addition we believe the downward pressure on and periodically depressed levels of us steel prices in some recent years have been further exacerbated by imports of steel involving dumping and subsidy abuses by foreign steel producers some foreign steel producers are owned controlled or subsidized by foreign governments as a result decisions by these producers with respect to their production sales and pricing are often influenced to a greater degree by political and economic policy considerations than by prevailing market conditions realities of the marketplace or consideration of profit or loss for example between 1998 and 2001 when imports of hotrolled and coldrolled products increased dramatically domestic steel producers including us were adversely affected by unfairly priced or “dumped” imported steel even though various protective actions taken by the us government during 2001 including the enactment of various steel import quotas and tariffs resulted in an abatement of some steel imports during 2002 and 2003 these protective measures were only temporary many foreign steel manufacturers were granted exemptions from the application of these measures and president bush in december 2003 rescinded a substantial part of these protective measures the socalled section 201 tariffs as a result of a november 10 2003 word trade organization ruling declaring that the tariffs on hotrolled and coldrolled finished steel imports violated global trade rules and as a result of economic and political pressures from foreign governments including threats of retaliatory tariffs on us exports moreover there are products and countries that were not covered by these protective measures and imports of these exempt products or of products from these countries may have an additional adverse effect upon our revenues and income in any event when any of these remaining measures expire or if they are further relaxed or repealed or if increasingly higher us steel prices enable foreign steelmakers to export their steel products into the united states even with the presence of duties or tariffs the resurgence of substantial imports of foreign steel could again create downward pressure on us steel prices 

 a significant factor in the worldwide strengthening of steel pricing over the past several years has been the explosive growth in chinese steel consumption which has vastly outpaced that country’s manufacturing capacity to produce its own steel needs this has resulted in china becoming a net importer of steel products as well as a net importer of raw materials and supplies required in the steel manufacturing process a combination of a slowdown in china’s economic growth rate and its consumption of steel coupled with its own expansion of steelmaking capacity could result in a substantial weakening of both domestic and global steel demand and steel pricing should chinese demand weaken china might not only become a net exporter of steel but many asian 

back to contents 

and european steel producers whose steel output currently feeds china’s steel import needs could find their way into the domestic market through increased steel imports thus causing an erosion of margins and a reduction in pricing 

 the highly competitive nature of the industry in part exerts downward pressure on prices for some of our products competition within the steel industry both domestically and worldwide is intense and it is expected to remain so we compete primarily on the basis of 1 price 2 quality and 3 the ability to meet our customers’ product needs and delivery schedules our primary competitors have traditionally been other minimills which may have cost structures and management cultures more similar to ours than integrated mills however we also compete with many integrated producers of hotrolled coldrolled coated and bar products many of which are larger and have substantially greater capital resources largely as a result of the consolidation within the us and worldwide steel industry brought about not only by bankruptcies and the resulting emergence of a number of integrated steel producers with lower capital costs new or renegotiated union work rules and labor costs the elimination or reduction of health care and pension legacy costs the introduction of more incentive based compensation and a more decentralized management structure some of these integrated producers now have cost structures that are much more competitive likewise with their lesser dependence on scrap as a component of their melt mix these producers may also from time to time enjoy a raw material cost advantage over the currently high cost of scrap that minimills must absorb the reduction in costs enjoyed by many integrated steel producers further increases the competitive environment in the steel industry and may contribute to future price declines 

in addition periodic global overcapacity in steel manufacturing or weak demand for steel products have historically had a negative impact on us steel pricing are likely to recur and could have a negative impact on our sales margins and profitability over the last decade periods of weak demand the construction of new minimills expansion and improved production efficiencies of some integrated mills and substantial expansion of foreign steel capacity have all led to an excess of manufacturing capacity increasingly this overcapacity when combined with periodic high levels of steel imports into the united states often at prices substantially below the exporters’ home market prices and not necessarily reflective of their costs of production or capital exerts downward pressure on domestic steel prices including the prices of our products and has resulted at times in a dramatic narrowing or with many companies the elimination of gross margins 

in the case of certain product applications we and other steel manufacturers also compete with manufacturers of other materials including plastic aluminum graphite composites glass wood and concrete 

 the price of steel may fluctuate significantly due to many factors beyond our control this fluctuation directly affects our product mix production volumes and our sales and earnings the steel industry is highly cyclical and many of our products are subject to fluctuations in supply and demand highly cyclical industries such as the automotive oil and gas gas transmission residential and commercialindustrial construction commercial equipment rail transportation appliance agricultural and durable goods industries represent significant markets for our company future economic downturns stagnant economies or currency fluctuations in the united states or globally could decrease the demand for our products or increase the amount of imports of steel into the united states which would decrease our sales margins and profitability we are also particularly sensitive to trends and events including strikes and labor unrest that may impact these industries these industries are significant markets for our products and are themselves highly cyclical

  if we should abandon or substantially reduce the scope of our iron dynamics project or if our iron dynamics process does not achieve success we will not be able to realize the expected benefits of this project and could suffer the loss of all or a substantial part of our entire investment as of december 31 2004 our investment in the iron dynamics project was 185 million since 1997 we have tried to develop and commercialize a pioneering process of producing a virgin form of iron to serve as a lower cost substitute for a portion of the metallic raw material mix that goes into our electric arc furnaces to be melted into new steel this scrap substitute project involves processes that are based on various technical assumptions and new applications of technologies that have yet to be fully commercially proven since our initial startup in august 1999 we encountered a number of difficulties associated with major pieces of equipment and with various operating processes and systems and since then have engaged in redesign reengineering reconstruction and retrofitting of major components of our systems and processes as a result the iron dynamics project has taken considerably longer and has required us to expend considerably greater resources than originally anticipated 

during the fourth quarter of 2002 we concluded that improved production technology coupled with our new ability to recycle waste material inputs and the increasingly high cost of scrap warranted an additional expenditure of approximately 13 million on certain additional modifications and refinements to the iron dynamics process in december 2003 we restarted the iron dynamics process the production of direct reduced iron on a rotary hearth furnace and the compaction of the dri into hot briquetted iron or hbi and during 2004 we restarted the submerged arc furnace to convert dri into liquid pig iron during 2004 we produced 173000 tonnes of direct reduced iron 106000 tonnes of which we converted into hbi and 47000 tonnes of which we converted into liquid pig iron 

while we remain optimistic that the remaining operational difficulties with the equipment technology systems and processes can be resolved our iron dynamics facility may not be able to consistently operate or be able to produce steel scrap substitute material whether dri hbi or liquid pig iron in the quantities and for costs that will enable it to be cost competitive with scrap or with purchased pig iron moreover our iron dynamics facility may experience additional shutdowns or equipment failures and such shutdowns or failures may have a material adverse impact on our liquidity cost structure and earnings 

we also plan to invest between 60 and 80 million over the next two years in a joint venture with kobe steel ltd clevelandcliffs inc and ferrometrics inc to build an iron nugget plant either in indiana or in minnesota using kobe’s proprietary itmk3 process we and our other joint venturers have successfully built and operated a small scale pilot project in minnesota using this process however while we believe that a full scale commercial plant should work as well as the pilot project and that when built it should be capable of consistently producing iron nuggets in sufficient quantities and with a cost structure that will compare favorably with the cost of scrap and of other scrap substitute products including pig iron we can provide no assurance that we will be able to achieve these expectations if we encounter cost overruns construction delays or systems or process difficulties during or after startup our anticipated capital costs could materially increase our expected operating cost benefits from the development of this iron nugget product could be diminished or lost and we could also lose our investment in the project 

 our sales margins and earnings are negatively impacted by decreases in domestic flatrolled steel prices since a significant portion of our flatrolled products are sold on the spot market as a result we are vulnerable to downturns in the domestic flatrolled steel market for the three year period ended december 31 2004 

back to contents 

approximately 80 of our flat roll division’s shipments were sold on the spot market under contracts with terms of twelve months or less 

 a prolonged weakness in the automotive industry would reduce the demand for our products and decrease our sales in addition if automobile manufacturers choose to incorporate more plastics aluminum and other steel substitutes in their automobiles it could reduce demand for our products our sales and earnings fluctuate due to the cyclical nature of the automotive industry the cyclical nature of the automotive industry is affected by such things as the level of consumer spending the strength or weakness of the us dollar and the impact of international trade and various factors such as labor unrest and the availability of raw materials which affect the ability of the automotive industry to actually build cars while we do not presently sell a material portion of our steel production directly to the automotive market a substantial portion of our sales to the intermediate steel processor and service center market is resold to various companies in the automotive industry 

 if we are unable to continue to pass on higher scrap and other raw material costs to our customers we will be less profitable we may not be able to adjust our product prices or to continue to impose surcharges especially in the shortterm to recover the costs of increases in scrap and other raw material prices which have reached historically high levels in december 2003 the market price of no 1 factory bundles a key scrap commodity was 186 per ton in december 2004 the market price of no 1 factory bundles was 376 per ton our principal raw material is scrap metal and prices for scrap are subject to market forces largely beyond our control including demand by us and international steel producers freight costs and speculation 

a combination of a weak us dollar exceptionally strong chinese and global demand for scrap and lower production of domestic scrap due to a weak manufacturing economy and the continued loss of manufacturing to foreign competition have driven scrap offshore at exceptionally high prices have reduced the available domestic scrap supply and have caused the price of domestic scrap to soar to historical highs such scrap costs are unsustainable even with the sharply increased pricing for our manufactured steel and could erode or eliminate our gross margins during february 2004 we announced the imposition of scrap surcharges keyed to a published scrap index and with minor exceptions these were accepted we have no assurance however that this will continue to be so or that customers will agree to pay ever higher prices for our steel products sufficient for us to maintain our margins without resistance or the selection of other suppliers or alternative materials if this occurs we may lose customers we may be unable to pass these higher scrap costs on to our customers and we may suffer an erosion of our earnings moreover some of our integrated steel producer competitors are not as dependant as we are on scrap as a major part of their raw material melt mix which during periods of high scrap costs relative to the cost of blast furnace iron used by the integrated producers even with the higher costs they must currently pay for iron ore coke coking coal and other raw materials used in their ironmaking processes may from time to time give them a raw material cost advantage over minimills in addition our operations require substantial amounts of other raw materials including various types of alloys refractories oxygen natural gas and electricity the price and availability of which are also subject to market conditions 

 fluctuations in the value of the united states dollar relative to other currencies may adversely affect our business a strong us dollar makes imported steel less expensive potentially resulting in more imports of steel products into the us by our foreign competitors as a result our steel products which are made in the united states may become relatively more expensive as compared to imported steel which in the past has had and in the future could have a negative impact on our sales revenues margins and profitability

 a loss of any large customer or group of customers could materially reduce our sales and earnings we have substantial business relationships with a few large customers in 2004 our flat roll division’s top ten customers accounted for approximately 36 of our consolidated net sales during this period our largest customer heidtman steel products inc accounted for approximately 12 of our consolidated net sales we expect to continue to depend upon a small number of customers for a significant percentage of our net sales and cannot assure you that any of them will continue to purchase steel from us 

 if a dispute arises between us and heidtman we may be viewed as having a conflict of interest what is best for heidtman as a buyer and what is best for us as a product seller may be at odds we may be unable to resolve potential conflicts if we do resolve them we may receive a less favorable resolution since we are dealing with heidtman rather than an unaffiliated person heidtman is an affiliate of one of our large stockholders and its president and chief executive officer serves as one of our directors this person has obligations to us as well as to heidtman and may have conflicts of interest with respect to matters potentially or actually involving or affecting us and heidtman 

 interruptions in our production capabilities will inevitably increase our production costs and reduce our sales and earnings for the affected period in addition to equipment failures our facilities are also subject to the risk of catastrophic loss due to unanticipated events such as fires explosions or weather conditions our manufacturing processes are dependent upon critical pieces of steelmaking equipment such as our furnaces continuous casters and rolling equipment as well as electrical equipment such as transformers and this equipment may on occasion be out of service as a result of unanticipated failures we have experienced and may in the future experience material plant shutdowns or periods of reduced production as a result of such equipment failures moreover any interruption in production capability may require us to make significant capital expenditures to remedy the problem which could have a negative effect on our profitability and cash flows we may also sustain revenue losses in excess of any recoveries we make under any applicable business interruption insurance coverages we may have in addition to such revenue losses longerterm business disruption could result in a loss of customers which could adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

 the loss of the services of one or more members of our senior management team or our inability to attract retain and maintain additional senior management personnel could harm our business financial condition results of operations and future prospects our senior management founded our company pioneered the development of thinslab flatrolled technology and directed the construction of our butler flat roll minimill columbia city structural and rail minimill and our pittsboro bar products minimill our operations and prospects depend in large part on the performance of our senior management team including keith e busse president and chief executive officer mark d millett vice president and general manager of our flat roll division richard p teets jr vice president and general manager of our structural and rail division glenn pushis vice president and general manager of our bar products division and john w nolan vice president sales and marketing although these senior managers have each been employees and stockholders of steel dynamics for many years these individuals may not always remain with us as employees in addition we may not be able to find qualified replacements for any of these individuals if their services are no longer available we do not have key man insurance on any of these individuals

 our growth strategy subjects us to various risks as part of our growth strategy we may expand our existing facilities build additional plants acquire other businesses and steel assets enter into joint ventures or form strategic alliances that we believe will complement our existing business these transactions will likely involve some or all of the following risks 

           these transactions might be required for us to remain competitive but we may not be able to complete any such transactions on favorable terms or obtain financing if necessary for such transactions on favorable terms future transactions may not improve our competitive position and business prospects as anticipated and if they do not our sales and earnings may be significantly reduced 

 we are subject to the risk of substantial environmental liability and limitations on our operations brought about by the requirements of environmental laws and regulations we are subject to various federal state and local environmental health and safety laws and regulations concerning such issues as air emissions wastewater discharges solid and hazardous materials and waste handling and disposal and the investigation and remediation of contamination these laws and regulations are increasingly stringent while we believe that our facilities are and will continue to be in material compliance with all applicable environmental laws and regulations the risks of substantial costs and liabilities related to compliance with such laws and regulations are an inherent part of our business although we are not currently involved in any remediation activities it is possible that future conditions may develop arise or be discovered that create substantial environmental remediation liabilities and costs for example our steelmaking operations produce certain waste products such as electric arc furnace dust which are classified as hazardous waste and must be properly disposed of under applicable environmental laws these laws can impose clean up liability on generators of hazardous waste and other substances that are shipped offsite for disposal regardless of fault or the legality of the disposal activities other laws may require us to investigate and remediate contamination at our properties including contamination that was caused in whole or in part by third parties while we believe that we can comply with environmental legislation and regulatory requirements and that the costs of doing so have been included within our budgeted cost estimates it is possible that such compliance will prove to be more limiting and costly than anticipated

in addition to potential clean up liability in the past we have been and in the future we may become subject to substantial monetary fines and penalties for violation of applicable laws regulations or administrative conditions we may also be subject from time to time to legal proceedings brought by private parties or governmental agencies with respect to environmental matters including matters involving alleged property damage or personal injury 

  as of december 31 2004 we had no indebtedness under our senior secured credit facility 300 million in connection with our 912 senior unsecured notes due 2009 115 million in connection with our 4 convertible subordinated notes due 2012 and approximately 33 million of other indebtedness including 7 million of unamortized bond premium 

our substantial indebtedness limits our financial and operating flexibility for example it could 

     our ability to satisfy our debt obligations will depend upon our future operating performance which in turn will depend upon the successful implementation of our strategy and upon financial competitive regulatory technical and other factors many of which are beyond our control if we are not able to generate sufficient cash from operations to make payments under our credit agreements or to meet our other debt service obligations we will need to refinance our indebtedness our ability to obtain such financing will depend upon our financial condition at the time the restrictions in the agreements governing our indebtedness and other factors including general market and economic conditions if such refinancing were not possible we could be forced to dispose of assets at unfavorable prices even if we could obtain such financing we cannot be sure that it would be on terms that are favorable to us in addition we could default on our debt obligations 

 our business strategy may require additional substantial capital investment we require capital for among other purposes managing acquired assets acquiring new equipment maintaining the condition of our existing equipment completing future acquisitions and maintaining compliance with environmental laws and regulations to the extent that cash generated internally and cash available under our credit facilities is not sufficient to fund capital requirements we may require additional debt andor equity financing however this type of financing may not be available or if available may not be on satisfactory terms future debt financing if available may result in increased interest and amortization expense increased leverage and decreased income available to fund further acquisitions and expansion in addition future debt financing may limit our ability to withstand competitive pressures and render us more vulnerable to economic downturns if we fail to generate or obtain sufficient additional capital in the future we could be forced to reduce or delay capital expenditures and acquisitions sell assets or restructure or refinance our indebtedness

          a breach of any of the restrictions or covenants in our debt agreements could cause a default under our senior secured credit agreement other debt or the notes a significant portion of our indebtedness then may become immediately due and payable we are not certain whether we would have or be able to obtain sufficient funds to make these accelerated payments including payments on the notes 

 our ability to pay principal and interest on our various notes and on our other debt and to fund our planned capital expenditures depends on our future operating performance our future operating performance is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties that are often beyond our control including general economic conditions and financial competitive regulatory and environmental factors for a discussion of some of these risks and uncertainties please see “risk factors — risks related to our business” consequently we may not have sufficient cash flow to meet our liquidity needs including making payments on our indebtedness 

if our cash flow and capital resources are insufficient to allow us to make scheduled payments on our various notes or on our other debt we may have to sell assets seek additional capital or restructure or refinance our debt if we are required to do that the terms of our debt may not allow for these alternative measures even if permitted such measures might not satisfy our scheduled debt service obligations

    our butler flat roll steel minimill manufactures hotrolled coldrolled and coated steel products it currently has an annual capacity of 24 million tons we produced 24 million tons at this facility during both 2003 and 2004 our products are characterized by high quality surface characteristics precise tolerances and light gauge in addition our minimill was one of the first us flat roll minimills to achieve iso 9002 and qs 9000 certifications we believe that these certifications have enabled us to serve a broader range of customers and endusers 

 our hot mill’s electric arc furnace melting process begins with the charging of a furnace vessel with scrap steel carbon and lime or with a combination of scrap and a scrap substitute or alternative iron product electricity is then applied to melt the scrap 

we have two fuchs twinshell electric arc melting furnaces when melting is being done in one vessel we can tap the other vessel and refill it with scrap and steel scrap substitute to make it ready for the next melt this results in more heats and greater productivity per shift an additional advantage of our twinshell design is that if there is a maintenance problem requiring work on one vessel melting can proceed in the other vessel without interruption 

after exiting the furnaces the liquid steel is transported in a ladle by overhead crane to an area commonly known as the ladle metallurgy station at each metallurgy station the steel is kept in a molten state while metallurgical testing refining alloying and desulfurizing takes place we have three separate ladle metallurgy stations consisting of three furnaces and two desulfurization stations 

the liquid steel is then transported to one of our two continuous thinslab casters built by sms schloemannsiemag ag where it is emptied into a tundish or reservoir this reservoir controls the flow of the liquid steel into a watercooled copperlined mold from which it then exits as an externally solid slab the slab from the continuous caster is less than two inches thick and proceeds directly into one of our two tunnel furnaces the tunnel furnaces maintain and equalize the slab’s temperature the slab leaves the tunnel furnace and is descaled to remove surface scale prior to its rolling 

in the hotrolling operation the slab is progressively reduced in thickness our hotrolling mill consists of a sevenstand rolling mill built by sms schloemannsiemag ag the mill is equipped with the latest electronic and hydraulic controls to control such things as gauge shape profile and exit speeds of the steel strip as it moves along the runout table to help prevent thinner steel strip from cobbling the rolling mill is capable of rolling sheet steel down to 10 mm with excellent surface quality and enables us to access markets previously available only to more costly cold finished material 

after exiting the hotrolling mill the rolled sheet steel is cooled and wound into coils 

back to contents 

we sell a portion of our hot band coil production directly to endusers or to intermediate steel processors or service centers where they may be pickled coldrolled annealed tempered or galvanized by those customers to an ever increasing extent the rest of our hot band coil production is directed to our cold mill where we add value to this product through our own pickling coldrolling annealing tempering or galvanizing processes including the additional coating capacity provided by our recently completed paint line we also now supply our new jeffersonville indiana galvanizing facility with coldrolled material 

 coldrolling reduces gauge hardens the steel and when further processed through an annealing furnace and temper mill improves uniformity ductility and formability coldrolling can also add a variety of finishes and textures to the surface of the steel 

our cold mill is located adjacent to our hot mill and produces products that require gauges properties or surfaces that cannot be achieved in our hot mill 

our coldrolled mill process begins with hotrolled product from our hotrolling mill entering our continuous pickle line we unwind the coils and attach them end to end by a welder creating a continuous strip through the pickle tanks at the delivery end of the line there is a reel for recoiling the pickled product after recoiling each coil is stored in a central coil storage area the design of the continuous pickle line allows for the production of a wide combination of gauges and widths on the light gauge steel supplied by the hot mill 

from the central coil storage area we move our coils in one of three directions we can 1 ship pickled and oiled coils directly to customers from the continuous pickle line as finished product 2 immediately galvanize some coils on the hotrolled galvanizing line which is then sold as finished product or 3 process coils through our coldreversing mill 

pickled and oiled coils that are not intended for immediate shipment or hotrolled galvanizing are processed in our cold reversing mill our cold reversing mill was built by sms schloemannsiemag ag and is one of only two semitandem twostand reversing cold rolling operations in the world this configuration provides considerably higher throughput than a conventional singlestand reversing mill yet also takes advantage of considerably lower equipment costs than the conventional four to sixstand tandem coldrolling mill 

product that exits the cold reversing mill can then be shipped as finished product transported to our coldrolled galvanizing line or transported to our batch annealing furnaces coldrolled sheet is hotrolled sheet that has been further processed through a continuous pickle line and then successively passed through a rolling mill without reheating until the desired gauge and other physical properties have been achieved 

as with our hot mill our cold mill is linked by means of business and process computers we expanded our computer systems to comprehend order entry of the additional cold mill products and we accomplish all of our line scheduling in the computer systems through schedules transmitted to the appropriate process related computers we collect operating and quality data for analysis and quality control purposes and for reporting product data to customers 

 our 25 million onsite paint line located immediately adjacent to our existing cold mill building was completed during 2003 and has an estimated coating capacity of 240000 tons per year in gauges from 010 to 070 inches and in widths ranging from 36 to 64 inches the paint line receives material directly from our other processing lines and is capable of painting hot rolled galvanized coil cold rolled coil and cold rolled galvanized coil the line incorporates stateoftheart coil coating equipment with quick color change capability and online color matching inline tension leveling direct heat clean air catenary ovens and a thermal recuperative oxidizer 

we believe that we are the only mill in north america with an onsite paint line which should not only enable us to realize substantial savings in overhead maintenance engineering sales and marketing capital cost and infrastructure but will eliminate the typical cost of transfer freight approximately 1015 per ton that a

customer must otherwise pay to transport coils to other remote coating facilities these advantages will further enable us to continue to be a low cost supplier of coated products the addition of our paint line further expands our high margin value added product offerings 

 our jeffersonville indiana cold rolled galvanizing facility which we purchased in march 2003 for 190 million is located within the clark maritime center on the ohio river the galvanizing line has an estimated capacity of between 300000 and 350000 tons per year and is capable of coating cold rolled steel in gauges from 008 to 045 inches and in widths between 24 and 60 inches this gauge range is lighter than that available from our butler facility and therefore creates a further expansion of our value added product offerings particularly in the light gauge building products arena 

the galvanizing line was built in 1999 has been well maintained and is almost identical to the cold rolled galvanizing line at our butler mill this familiarity helped us to facilitate a rapid startup in july 2003 this facility enables us to continue to serve existing cold rolled galvanized customers whose needs we might have otherwise been unable to meet the ohio river location of this facility also creates opportunities for market expansion into other geographic regions our butler cold mill provides the jeffersonville facility with cold rolled material 

  we began construction of our structural steel and rail minimill in columbia city indiana in may 2001 completed plant construction in april 2002 and commenced commercial structural steel operations during the third quarter of 2002 our minimill is designed to have an annual production capacity of up to 12 million tons of structural steel beams pilings and other steel components for the construction transportation and industrial machinery markets as well as standard and premium grade rails for the railroad industry through regular product introductions and continued production rampup of structural steel products we were able to begin to offer a broad array of wide flange beams and hpiling structural steel products during 2003 and during 2003 we were also able to commission all of our structural steel product lines except for 6 inch and 36 inch beams we commissioned our 36 inch beams during 2004 and our 6 inch beams will be available for sale during the second quarter of 2005 

with regard to our rail production facility we commissioned the casting and rolling equipment for the production of rail products during 2003 and in 2004 commissioned the rail finishing and inspection facility during subsequent 2004 rolling trials however we determined that the finished rail sections contained certain quality imperfections which we traced to the casting process while the resulting product was acceptable for industrial use it would not qualify for class i railroad use so we made necessary process and equipment modifications to address the problem ran confirmatory trials during the balance of 2004 and ordered and recently received new casting machine molds we believe that these deficiencies are fixable and that we will be able to produce class i quality standard rail during the second quarter of 2005 which we will provide to the railroad companies to be tested and monitored for product evaluation 

 our structural steel and rail minimill melts scrap and scrap substitutes in an electric arc furnace much the same way as in our flat roll minimill we use a single shell furnace but have purchased and installed a second furnace which provides us with backup melting capability in case of a furnace breakdown or during one of our periodic maintenance outages scrap is our primary raw material however but the type of scrap required for the production of structural steel and rail products is generally of a cheaper and less expensive grade than that required for the production of flatrolled steel 

back to contents 

from the furnace the molten metal is transported to a separate ladle metallurgy furnace where as in the flat roll minimill we adjust temperature and chemistry we then take the liquid steel to a continuous caster which casts three strands expandable to four of blooms and beam blanks the caster utilizes a curved mold that produces six sizes of material—two blooms which are rectangular shaped and four beam blanks which are dog bone shaped in varying lengths of 17 to 48 feet the caster design accommodates a quickchange tundish nozzle system designed to optimize the continuous casting process and to achieve a low operational cost per ton the tundish bottoms are also designed to change from a bloom opening to any of four beam blank sizes to allow greater flexibility in product choice 

after exiting the mold the multiple strands continue through a series of sprays and roller supports to precisely cool and contain the cast shapes straightener rolls then unbend the curved strands onto a horizontal passline where they are cut to length by automatic torches we then weigh the cast pieces and transport them either directly through a reheat furnace to a hotrolling mill or into a storage area for rolling at a later time in the hotrolling mill the product passes through a breakdown stand where it is rolled into either a structural steel product or a rail product depending on the rollconfiguration and number of passes the product is then transferred to a 3stand tandem mill which consists of a universal rougher an edger and a universal finisher the hotrolling mill is an advanced fourstand all reversing mill built by sms demag ag the minimill is capable of producing wide flange beams from 6” x 4” to 36” x 12” standard beams piling sections mshape sections sheet piling channels car building shapes bulb angles and zee’s and rail sections 

downstream of the hotrolling mill a hot saw cuts the structural steel to a maximum 246foot length before it enters a cooling bed after cooling the structural steel product is straightened on a roller straightener and cut to length as required by a particular order the product is then piled and bundled and shipped as finished product 

for the production of rail products we fitted our caster with special molds and segments to cast the new 13” x 10” blooms required for rail production we have also added electro magnetic stirring within the caster to improve surface quality and reduce internal cracking the reheat furnace which heats the blooms to the proper rolling temperature is also fitted with automation changes for the charging and discharging machines we also operate additional descaling equipment prior to the rolling process as well as a rail stamper and manipulator both vertical and horizontal straighteners will be used to produce a rail that is true along all axes after straightening the rail product will be tested cut to length and drilled in our testing center we provide ultrasonic testing for the detection of internal defects an eddy current machine to spot surface cracks a profile gauge for dimensional accuracy and a straightnesswaviness measurement machine we will also be capable of manufacturing highly desirable 320foot rail lengths which no one else produces in or imports into the us or canadian rail markets 

 historically the price of steel scrap as a commodity has tended to be volatile rising and falling with supply and demand and not always in lock step with or in proportion to the market price of new steel more recently and increasingly so during the last half of 2003 and during 2004 scrap costs accelerated to historic highs threatening one of the principal elements of the minimills’ traditional lower cost structure—the cost of its metallic raw material therefore having a lower cost alternative source of virgin iron for a portion of a mini mill’s melt mix if realizable would partially buffer the effects of high scrap prices and scrap price volatility with the growing proportion of electric furnace steelmaking both worldwide and domestically we believe that the benefits of developing a costeffective alternate iron source to augment scrap our primary raw material makes good economic sense in the long run 

since 1997 iron dynamics has tried to develop and commercialize a pioneering process of producing a virgin form of iron that might serve as a lower cost substitute for a portion of the metallic raw material mix that goes into our electric arc furnaces to be melted into new steel direct reduced iron is a metallic product made 

back to contents 

from iron ore or iron ore “fines” that have been treated in a “direct reduction” furnace such as a rotary hearth furnace with either natural gas or coal to reduce the iron oxide to metallic iron the method selected by iron dynamics is one that uses coal as the reducing agent the direct reduced iron or dri is then compacted by briquetters to form hot briquetted iron or hbi which is stable and can be immediately used in our melting furnaces or stockpiled for later use liquid pig iron the ultimate end product intended to be produced by iron dynamics is a pure metal product produced by smelting the direct reduced iron in a submerged arc furnace our iron dynamics facility was designed and built for the production of direct reduced iron and its conversion into liquid pig iron we have used and plan to use all of iron dynamics’ hbi and liquid pig iron in our steelmaking operations 

since the plant’s initial startup in august 1999 we have made continuous process design and equipment modifications as we encountered various quality and consistency issues with this pioneering technology 

during 2003 after further evaluation of certain production trials we concluded that our improved production technology coupled with our ability to recycle waste materials as part of our raw material mix and the increasingly higher price of scrap warranted further modifications and refinements and these were completed in connection with the liquid pig iron conversion process the direct reduced iron is first liquefied and the hot liquid pig iron is then transferred in ladles to the flat roll mill’s meltshop and combined with scrap steel in the mill’s electric arc furnaces during 2004 the iron dynamics facility produced 173000 tonnes of direct reduced iron of which 106000 tonnes were converted into hbi and 47000 tonnes were converted into liquid pig iron all of iron dynamics’ production was used by our steelmaking operations 

as of december 31 2004 our equity investment in the iron dynamics project was 185 million 

 in march 2002 we formed a joint venture with certain entities owned by kobe steel ltd clevelandcliffs inc and ferrometrics inc to pursue the development of a proprietary process owned by kobe known as “itmk3 ® ” for the production of a fully metallized iron nugget product suitable for use as an alternative iron or scrap substitute feedstock in electric arc furnace steelmaking 

based on the successful operation of the pilot plant we are planning to invest between 60 and 80 million in a joint venture over the next two years to construct a fullscale commercial plant which will be located either in indiana or in minnesota we expect to own a majority of the equity in this joint venture and to enter into an offtake agreement with the joint venture for the iron nuggets to use in our steelmaking operations 

  we purchased our pittsboro indiana bar minimill from qualitech steel sbq llc in september 2002 and during 2004 completed our announced program to upgrade and retrofit the mill to produce a broad array of merchant quality or mbq bars and shapes and reinforcing bar products as well as special bar quality or sbq products as of december 31 2004 we had invested a total of 1474 million in the facility which includes the original acquisition cost of 45 million and capitalized interest of 66 million the mill was originally constructed in 1997 as an sbq mill and as upgraded consists generally of a 100 ton single shell ac melting furnace a three strand sms demag continuous caster capable of casting both a 7” x 7” billet and a 14” x 10” bloom a reheat furnace and a rolling mill consisting of a roughing mill and intermediate mill and kocks reducing and sizing blocks used in the production of sbq rounds the meltshop is also equipped with a separate ladle metallurgy facility or lmf where metallurgical testing refining alloying and desulfurizing takes place and a vacuum tank degasser which is used to degas steel to produce high carbon and alloy grades of steel and ultra high purity products we also added an eight stand finishing mill together with ancillary equipment such as abrasive saws shears a straightener and magnetic stacking equipment which enables us to produce a variety

of merchant bars and shapes as well as reinforcing bar products and during 2004 we completed the installation of equipment to enable the mill to produce smaller rounds angles flats channels and similar products the pittsboro facility will have an annual production capacity of between 500000 and 600000 tons 

 during 2003 we increased our ownership in our consolidated new millennium building systems subsidiary from a 466 ownership interest to 100 

the new millennium butler indiana facility which began production in june of 2000 produces steel building components including joists girders trusses and steel roof and floor decking which we sell primarily in the upper midwest nonresidential building components market our flat roll division supplies a majority of the hotrolled steel utilized in new millennium’s manufacturing operations during 2004 new millennium produced 96000 tons of steel building components in its butler indiana facility 

in september 2004 new millennium began construction of a new 270000 square foot manufacturing facility in lake city florida as of january 31 2005 we had invested 217 million for the construction of this plant which will manufacture a similar array of steel building components as our butler indiana facility but will market these products primarily in florida and in the southeastern part of the united states the florida facility began shipping joist products in february 2005 and we expect to begin shipping decking material in april 2005 we currently plan to supply our new florida plant with hotrolled steel primarily from our flat roll division 

steel dynamics inc was incorporated in august 1993 in indiana we maintain our principal executive offices at 6714 pointe inverness way suite 200 fort wayne indiana 46804 our telephone number is 260 4593553 

  products our flat roll division produces hotrolled products that include a variety of high quality mild and medium carbon and high strength low alloy hotrolled bands in 40 inch to 62 inch widths and in thicknesses from 500 inch down to 043 inch we also produce an array of lighter gauge hotrolled products including high strength low alloy 80000 minimum yield and medium carbon steels made possible by the addition of our seventh hotrolling stand these products are suitable for automobile truck trailer and recreational vehicle parts and components mechanical and structural steel tubing gas and fluid transmission piping metal building systems rail cars ships barges and other marine equipment agricultural equipment and farm implements lawn garden and recreation equipment industrial machinery and shipping containers 

we believe that our basic production hot band material has shape characteristics that exceed those of the other thinslab flat roll minimills and compares favorably with those of the integrated mills in addition as a result of our lighter gauge hotrolling capabilities we are now able to produce hotrolled hotdipped galvanized and galvannealed steel products these products are capable of replacing products that have traditionally only been available as more costly coldrolled galvanized or coldrolled galvannealed steel our galvanizing facility will also further enable us to continue to add to our mix of higher margin value added products through our ability to coat additional material that would otherwise not be coated due to the galvanizing capacity limitations at our butler mill 

in our cold mill we also produce hotrolled pickled and oiled hotrolled hot dipped galvanized hotrolled galvannealed coldrolled hot dipped galvanized coldrolled galvannealed and fully processed coldrolled sheet our new paint line paints pickled and oiled hot rolled galvanized coil cold rolled coil and cold rolled galvanized coil in gauges from 010 to 070 inches and widths ranging from 36 inches to 64 inches this material is typically used in transportation products building products such as raised garage door panels heating and cooling products appliances furniture and lighting equipment

customers the following tables show information about the types of products we produced and the types of customers we sold to in 2003 and 2004 

 during 2004 we sold our products to approximately 190 customers in 2004 our largest customers were heidtman steel new process steel and dietrich industries which in the aggregate accounted for approximately 23 of our total net sales heidtman accounted individually for approximately 13 and 12 of our net sales in and 2003 and 2004 respectively 

steel processors and service centers typically act as intermediaries between primary steel producers such as us and the many enduser manufacturers that require further processing of hot bands the additional processing performed by the intermediate steel processors and service centers include pickling galvanizing cutting to length slitting to size leveling blanking shape correcting edge rolling shearing and stamping notwithstanding the completion of our cold mill and our increased utilization in our own cold finishing facility for a considerable portion of our hot band production we expect that our intermediate steel processor and service center customers will remain an integral part of our customer base our sales outside the continental united states accounted for approximately 3 of our consolidated net sales in 2004

 products we produce various structural steel products such as wide flange beams american standard beams miscellaneous beams “h” piling material sheet piling material american standard and miscellaneous channels bulb angles and “zee’s” the following listing shows each of our structural steel products and their intended markets 

 we have gradually been ramping up production of different structural products in various sizes and foot weights since we commenced initial production in july 2002 during 2004 we produced 695000 tons and shipped approximately 734000 tons of structural steel products we have also initiated certain value added services for the midwestern fabricator market including exact length and exact piece count capabilities 

customers the principal customers for our structural steel products are steel service centers steel fabricators and various manufacturers service centers though not the ultimate enduser provide valuable mill distribution functions to the fabricators and manufacturers including small quantity sales repackaging cutting preliminary processing and warehousing a majority of our structural steel products are sold to service centers 

the marketplace for steel rails in the united states and canada is relatively small approximately 800000 tons in 2003 and is also specialized with only approximately six class 1 railroad purchasers burlington northernsanta fe union pacific canadian pacific railway norfolk southern csx transportation and canadian national railway these purchasers account for approximately 600000 tons of annual production rail contractors transit districts and shortline railroads purchase the rest of the rail products 

once we fully commence rail production we plan to produce rail in standard and premium or headhardened grades in a range of weights from 115 lbs per yard to 141 lbs per yard in lengths from the traditional 80 feet up to 240 feet initially and ultimately to 320 feet we also intend to weld these 240320 foot rails into 1600 foot strings for delivery to the installation site such long strings offer substantial savings both in terms of initial capital cost and through reduced maintenance in contrast current production of rail in the united states and available imported rail is limited to 80foot lengths as a result of existing plant layout restrictions and the physical limitations of ocean freight the more welded joints there are in a mile of track the greater the maintenance cost to the railroad due to excessive wear and fatigue cracking at the welds

special bar quality products are uniquely designed to be in motion and include such items as gears shafts and forgings we can produce sbq rounds in sizes from 112” to 9” and sbq round cornered squares in sizes from 2” to 8” during 2004 since our startup in january we shipped approximately 287000 tons of sbq products virtually our entire first year output primarily for use by cold finishers forgers oem manufacturers and tubing mills 

merchant bar quality products are used in a wide variety of applications including automotive fasteners conveyor assemblies rack systems transmission towers gratings safety walkways stair railings farm and lawn and garden equipment light steel fabrication machinery ornamental iron projects and construction equipment during 2004 we produced only minimal tons of mbq products 

rebar is used principally for strengthening concrete approximately half of rebar consumption is in construction projects involving the private sector including commercial and industrial buildings apartments and hotels utility construction agricultural projects and various repair and maintenance applications the other half of rebar consumption is accounted for by public works projects such as highway and street construction public buildings bridges municipal water and sewer treatment facilities and similar projects during 2004 we produced very small quantities of rebar products 

customers merchant bar products are generally sold to fabricators steel service centers and original equipment manufacturers rebar is generally sold to fabricators and manufacturers who cut bend shape and fabricate the steel to meet engineering architectural and endproduct specifications sbq products are principally consumed by cold finishers forgers intermediate processors oem manufacturers and steel service centers 

 products new millennium fabricates trusses girders steel joists and steel decking for the nonresidential construction industry specifically new millennium manufactures a complete line of joist products including bowstring arched scissor doublepitched and singlepitched joists decking products include a full range of roof form and composite floor decks 

customers new millennium’s primary customers are nonresidential contractors significant portions of new millennium’s sales are to customers from outside indiana with a concentration to date in the upper midwest area of the united states we believe that the upper midwest presently enjoys the highest nonresidential building spending in the country however with our new lake city florida plant we will cater to markets in florida and in the southeastern united states as well 

  our hotrolled products compete with many north american integrated hotrolled coil producers such as us steel’s plants near detroit michigan granite city illinois gary indiana dravosburg pennsylvania and fairfield alabama ispat inland inc’s plant in east chicago indiana and ak steel corporation’s plant in middletown ohio we also compete with international steel group or isg which purchased out of bankruptcy ltv steel corporation’s former steelmaking facilities at cleveland ohio and indiana harbor indiana acme steel’s rolling facility in chicago and the former bethlehem steel plants in burns harbor indiana and sparrow’s point maryland we also compete with companies that convert steel slabs into sheet steel such as duferco steel in farrell pennsylvania as a result of the integrated mills’ lesser dependence on steel scrap as a raw material than minimills and as a result of the consolidations that have occurred over the past several years in the us

steel industry including the emergence of relaxed union work rules and lower capital structures many of these integrated mills are beginning to have cost structures closer to those of the mini mills rendering them more competitive than traditionally so 

our hotrolled products also compete with the products of a number of hotrolled minimills such as nucor corporation’s 16 million ton capacity plant in crawfordsville indiana its 17 million ton capacity plant in hickman arkansas and its 20 million ton capacity plant in berkeley south carolina gallatin steel company’s 12 million ton capacity plant in ghent kentucky and north star bhp steel llc’s 12 million ton capacity plant in delta ohio 

with the exception of gallatin steel we compete with these same producers for the sale of our coldrolled and coated products we also compete with a number of companies such as worthington steel of columbus ohio winner steel of sharon pennsylvania and metaltech of pittsburgh pennsylvania which buy their hotrolled or coldrolled bands from other producers and then convert them into products that are competitive with ours 

 sales of structural steel products are sensitive to the level of construction activity which is in turn affected by such cyclical factors as general economic conditions interest rates inflation consumer spending and employment 

our structural steel products compete with a sizable number of electric arc furnace structural steelmakers some of which have cost structures and flexible management cultures similar to our own notable competitors include nucor steel in berkeley south carolina nucoryamato steel in blytheville arkansas and txichaparral steel in midlothian texas and petersburg virginia there are also a number of smaller competitors including ameristeel in cartersville georgia and bayou steel in laplace louisiana the nucor minimills and the txichaparral minimills have accounted for the greatest bulk of the tons produced in north america over the past three years we also believe however that both geography and product choice will play significant roles there are currently no other structural mills located in the midwest one of the largest structural steel consuming regions in the united states and we believe we can provide freightsaving and customer service benefits to end users service centers and fabricators located in the region we also believe that most of canada’s structural steel consumption is located in canada’s eastern provinces closer to us than to either of our two largest competitors moreover we intend to provide a broad product mix focusing on the midrange and larger section served only by nucoryamato steel and txichaparral from locations more remote than our minimill 

at present the rail market is principally served by imports and two domestic producers rocky mountain steel a division of oregon steel mills inc in pueblo colorado and pennsylvania steel technologies formerly a subsidiary of bethlehem steel corporation now isg in steelton pennsylvania each of these producers has the capability to produce either standard or premium rail although neither is equipped to produce rail in 240foot or 320foot lengths as we plan to do once we begin to produce class i quality rail our rail products will also compete with similar imported products from a number of high quality integrated and electric furnace steel producers in europe and asia including british steel voestalpine schienen nippon steel and nkk 

 our major competitors for sbq product sales within a 500 mile radius of pittsboro include republic technologies international of akron ohio the timken company of canton ohio quanexmacsteel in jackson michigan and monroe michigan and ispatinland steel in east chicago indiana 

our major competitors for merchant bar shapes and reinforcing bar product sales likewise generally within a 500 mile radius of pittsboro indiana include ameristeel plants in knoxville and jackson tennessee marion

 our principal raw material is scrap metal derived from among other sources “home scrap” generated internally at steel mills themselves industrial scrap generated by excess steel trimmed or produced during manufacturing and “obsolete” scrap such as railroad cars and railroad track materials agricultural machinery and demolition scrap from obsolete structures containers and machines 

 scrap is the single most important raw material used in our minimill steelmaking process traditionally comprising approximately 8085 of the metallic melt mix in electric arc furnace steelmaking in contrast to integrated mill steelmaking where the proportion of scrap has traditionally been approximately 20 depending upon the carbon content of scrap substitute material that may be available from time to time and the relative cost of such material the percentage of scrap used in our steelmaking operations could be reduced to the range of 60 or less of our metallic melt mix 

as it relates to final product quality electric arc furnace flat roll steel producers can normally only tolerate a maximum 2 level of residual materials such as nonferrous metallic contamination from copper nickel tin chromium and molybdenum which once having been dissolved into steel cannot be refined out in order for the scrap melt to provide this level of quality under present circumstances the mill must use approximately 60 of “low residual” scrap or an equivalent material such low residual scrap is generally more expensive and takes the form of no 1 dealer bundles no 1 factory bundles busheling and clips such low residual scrap is generally more expensive the balance of the melt mix can then consist of various grades of higher residual and thus less expensive scrap which can be blended with low residual scrap to keep within impurity tolerances 

many variables can impact scrap prices all of which reflect the pushes and pulls of the supply demand equation these factors include the level of us new steel production for high quality low residual scrap is a byproduct of new steel manufacturing activity the level of exports of scrap from the united states the amount of obsolete scrap production and the effect of speculation on the amount of scrap offered on the market from time to time the us has generally been a net scrap exporter generally as domestic steel demand increased so did scrap demand and resulting scrap prices the reverse was also normally but not always true with scrap prices following steel prices downward where supply exceeded demand 

starting during the latter part of 2002 however and continuing through 2003 and 2004 the price of scrap has risen sharply upward to historic highs largely as a result of foreign scrap demand particularly from china a weak us dollar that makes us scrap exports more attractive and relatively static if not limited scrap availability in the us these factors have driven scrap prices to their highest levels in decades in december 2003 the price of no 1 factory bundles a key scrap commodity was approximately 186 per ton the same commodity cost 376 per ton in december 2004 

back to contents 

we believe that the demand for low residual scrap will continue to rise more rapidly than the supply in the coming years especially with the increased number of electric arc furnace minimills both here and abroad that have been built or commenced operations in recent years and especially due to foreign scrap demand 

as a result in order to maintain an available supply of scrap at competitive market prices we have established and intend to maintain multiple strong and dependable sources through which to competitively purchase scrap of all grades including low residual scrap have added our own inhouse scrap purchasing department may establish our own or may joint venture with others to develop scrap facilities and have been active in developing our own sources of scrap substitute products such as iron dynamics and our mesabi nugget project 

 direct reduced iron hot briquetted iron and pig iron can substitute for a limited portion of the steel scrap used in electric furnace minimill steel production historically we have used approximately 15 by weight of scrap substitutes in our melt mix mainly imported pig iron during 2004 we consumed approximately 600000 tons of scrap substitutes of the 41 million tons of metallics that we melted in our electric arc furnaces slightly over 25 of the scrap substitutes consumed came from iron dynamics all purchases of scrap substitutes were made on the spot market at prevailing market prices 

we anticipate that we will utilize all of iron dynamics’ scrap substitute product output whether hbi or liquid pig iron upon anticipated commissioning of our mesabi nugget joint venture operation during 2006 we also plan on having an offtake agreement for nearly all of the iron nuggets to be produced 

  the us steel industry has historically been and continues to be highly cyclical in nature influenced by many factors including periods of economic growth or recession strength or weakness of the us dollar worldwide production capacity worldwide steel demand and levels of steel imports the steel industry has also been affected by various companyspecific factors such as a company’s ability or inability to adapt to and deal with technological change plant inefficiency and high labor costs the us has traditionally been a net importer of steel 

during the second half of 2000 and throughout 2001 the us steel industry experienced a severe downward cycle largely as a result of increased imports of steel at depressed prices the effect of a strong dollar weak economic conditions and excess global steel production capacity on the other hand during the first half of 2002 domestic flatrolled steel prices increased dramatically from historical cyclical lows in 2001 this increase resulted from a number of factors including 1 a temporary reduction in domestic steel production capacity as a result of certain bankruptcies and shutdowns of other us steel producers 2 a reduction in imports driven in part by certain favorable rulings and executive actions with respect to tariffs and quotas on foreign steel and 3 a brief strengthening of the overall us economy and the need for endusers of steel products to replenish their depleted inventories the cycle began to turn downward again toward the end of 2002 and into early 2003 however largely as a result of softening product demand brought about by a still weak economy and war concerns the shortness of the previous up cycle poor cost controls and high fixed costs and legacy costs for many steel producers an absence of any supply or pricing discipline by individual producers and the strength of the us dollar that brought exports streaming into the country created the conditions for more than 40 bankruptcies among us steel producers mainly integrated producers between 2001 and 2003 

these economic dislocations rationalization of production capacity and supply due to steel industry consolidation a weakened us dollar high ocean freight rates and strong foreign mainly chinese and asian steel demand and scrap demand combined during 2003 to substantially reduce steel imports into the us thus

constraining the supply of new steel for domestic consumption moreover by rendering exports of steel abroad more attractive this has also acted to constrain the us supply of scrap for domestic consumption the result has not only been a dramatic increase in us steel pricing in late 2003 and throughout 2004 but it has also led to unprecedented increases in the cost of steel scrap 

the us steel industry experienced many changes during 2003 and 2004 as a result of consolidation in 2001 the top three us producers of flatrolled sheet had a 32 market share for 2003 the top three us steel isg and nucor had a market share of 55 international steel group added to its acquisition of the bankrupt steel assets of ltv steel with its acquisition of acme steel’s assets and its acquisition of the assets of bethlehem steel all three of these acquisitions resulted from the prior bankruptcies of the predecessor steel companies similarly us steel acquired the bankrupt assets of national steel these and similar developments caused formerly idled or inefficient production facilities to come back into the market with substantially lower capital costs with renegotiated labor agreements containing fewer work rules and reduced labor costs and shorn of many previously burdensome health care and retirement legacy costs and other liabilities the result of this restructuring and consolidation which we expect to continue is a more competitive us steel market with a narrowing of production cost differentials between minimills and some of these integrated producers moreover with the integrated mills’ lesser dependence on scrap as a percentage of their metallics melt mix than the minimills the traditional minimill cost advantage over integrated mill ironmaking may be reduced or eliminated when scrap prices are at high levels 

 us steel producers compete with many foreign producers competition from foreign producers is typically strong but is also substantially affected by the relative strength of foreign economies and fluctuation in the value of the us dollar against foreign currencies with steel imports tending to increase when the value of the dollar is strong in relation to foreign currencies during the 1990s the situation was exacerbated by a weakening of certain economies particularly in eastern europe asia and latin america because of the ownership control or subsidization of some foreign steel producers by their governments decisions by such producers with respect to their production sales and pricing decisions are often influenced to a greater degree by political and economic policy consideration than by prevailing market conditions realities of the marketplace or consideration of profit or loss since 1998 when imports of hotrolled and coldrolled products increased 43 compared to the prior year domestic steel producers including us have been adversely affected by illegally “dumped” imported steel dumping involves selling a product below cost or for less than in the exporter’s home country and is a violation of us trade laws most foreign markets are less open than the us market allowing foreign producers to maintain higher prices in their own markets while dumping excess production at lower and often subsidized prices into the us market a number of steel industry antidumping initiatives or trade cases have been brought in recent years in an attempt to stem the flow of these unlawful imports some have been successful and some have not 

 there are generally two kinds of primary steel producers “integrated mills” and “minimills” we are a minimill producer 

steel manufacturing by an “integrated” producer involves the production of liquid iron from iron ore coke and lime in a blast furnace the process involves ironmaking followed by steelmaking followed by billet or slab making followed by reheating and further rolling into steel plate or bar or flatrolling into sheet steel or coil these processes may in turn be followed by various finishing processes including coldrolling or various coating processes including galvanizing in integrated producer steelmaking metallurgical coal is converted to coke in a coke oven then combined in a blast furnace with iron ore and limestone to produce pig iron and then combined with scrap in a “basic oxygen” or other furnace and refined into liquid steel once produced the liquid steel is metallurgically refined and then either cast into ingots for later reheating and processing or 

back to contents 

transported to a continuous caster for casting into a billet or slab which is then further shaped or rolled into its final form typically though not always many of these processes take place in separate and remote facilities 

in contrast minimills such as our butler minimill our columbia city minimill and our pittsboro indiana minimill use an electric arc furnace to directly melt scrap or scrap substitutes thus entirely eliminating the energyintensive process of producing liquid iron in a blast furnace our flat roll mill also unifies the melting casting and the hotrolling into a continuous process 

as a group minimills have historically been characterized by lower costs of production and higher productivity than integrated mills this was due in part to lower capital costs and to lower operating costs resulting from their streamlined melting process and smaller more efficient plant layouts moreover minimills tended to employ a management culture such as ours that emphasizes flexible incentiveoriented nonunion labor practices and have tended to be more willing to adapt to newer and more innovative management styles that encourage decentralized decisionmaking the smaller plant size of a minimill also permits greater flexibility in the choice of location for the minimill in order to optimize access to scrap supply energy costs infrastructure and markets as is the case with our minimills furthermore a flat roll minimill’s more efficient plant size and layout which incorporates the melt shop casting and rolling in a unified continuous flow under the same roof have reduced or eliminated costly rehandling and reheating of semifinished steel they have also adapted quickly to the use of new and costeffective equipment thereby translating technological advances in the industry into efficient production however as a result of the movement toward steel industry consolidation coupled with the emergence from bankruptcy of previously inefficient and high capital cost and high operating cost steelmaking assets under new ownership with renegotiated and less burdensome labor contracts the cost differences between minimills and some integrated mill consolidators have begun to narrow moreover during periods of high scrap costs as at the present time integrated mills that produce their own blast furnace iron and are not as dependent as minimills upon scrap for the bulk of their melt mix actually experience lower raw material metallic costs than minimills thus further compressing the historical cost differentials between integrated and minimill steelmaking 

 the flat roll steel market represents the largest steel product group flatrolled products consist of hotrolled coldrolled and coated sheet and coil 

the following table shows the us shipments of flatrolled steel in net tons by hotrolled coldrolled and coated production as reported by the american iron and steel institute or aisa for the five years from 1999 through 2003

 all coiled flatrolled steel is initially hotrolled a process that consists of passing a cast slab through a multistand rolling mill to reduce its thickness to less than 12 inch hotrolled steel is minimally processed steel coil that is used in the manufacture of various nonsurface critical applications such as automobile suspension arms frames wheels and other unexposed parts in auto and truck bodies agricultural equipment construction products machinery tubing pipe tools lawn care products and guard rails 

 coldrolled steel is hotrolled steel that has been further processed through a pickler and then successively passed through a rolling mill without reheating until the desired gauge or thickness and other physical properties have been achieved coldrolling reduces gauge and hardens the steel and when further processed through an annealing furnace and a temper mill improves uniformity ductility and formability coldrolling can also impart various surface finishes and textures coldrolled steel is used in exposed steel applications that demand higher surface quality or finish such as exposed automobile and appliance panels as a result of higher processing costs coldrolled prices are typically higher than hotrolled prices typically coldrolled material is coated or painted 

 coated steel can be either hotrolled or coldrolled steel that has been coated with zinc to render it corrosionresistant and to improve its paintability hotdipped galvanized galvannealed electrogalvanized and aluminized products are types of coated steels these are also the highest valueadded sheet products because they require the greatest degree of processing and tend to have the strictest quality requirements coated steel is used in high volume applications such as automobiles household appliances roofing and siding heating and air conditioning equipment air ducts switch boxes chimney flues awnings garbage cans and food containers 

 the structural steel market is a relatively small part of total us steel shipments in 2001 2002 and 2003 structural steel shipments were 69 million tons 67 million tons and 74 million tons respectively and averaging less than 10 of the total steel market during these three years consumption of structural steel products is influenced both by new construction and manufacturing activity and by the selection of steel over alternative structural or manufacturing materials which has occurred at a relatively constant rate of 50 over the four years from 2000 through 2003 

 rail shipments in 2002 and 2003 were approximately 791000 tons and 803000 tons respectively including standard rail and premium or headhardened rail increased rail hardness results in a longer lasting product and is achieved by quenching hot rail with either air or water or by changing rail chemistry through the addition of alloys harder rail is more costly rail is produced in or imported into the us and canadian markets in standard lengths of 39 to 80 feet mainly due to the limitations of existing north american rail production equipment and plant layouts as well as the size limitations of ocean freighters with respect to imports as a result in order to produce the 1600foot rail “strings” desired by railroads 20 80foot rail sections are required to be welded together each weld is costly to make and increases installation and periodic maintenance costs once fully operational we intend to produce rail sections in length up to 320 feet and product that is currently unavailable in the united states and canada thus requiring fewer welds and less maintenance by the railroad users 

back to contents 

of the total shipments of rail during 2003 approximately 70 was produced by the two remaining us rail producers and 30 was imported mainly from japan and from europe there are currently no rail producers in canada 

 accordingly to aisi data apparent sbq supply has averaged approximately 7 million tons nationally over the 1999 to 2003 period 

according to aisi apparent supply of light structural shapes also characterized by a major dimension of less than 3 inches averaged approximately 2 million tons annually during the 1999 to 2003 period likewise aisi apparent rebar supply in the united states was approximately 7 million tons in the 1999 to 2003 period 

  with respect to our butler minimill our electric service contract with american electric power or aep extends through december 31 2005 the contract designated only 152 hours as “interruptible service” during 2003 and 140 hours during 2004 the contract also provides that the circumstances necessary to warrant any hours of service interruptions must be of an emergency nature and not related to price and demand the contract also establishes an agreed fixed rate for the rest of our electrical usage interruptible service subjects us to the risk of interruption at any time in the operation of the aep system whether as a result of an aep peak demand or even if aep were able to obtain a higher market price from an alternate buyer 

with respect to our columbia city structural steel and rail minimill the plant site is located within the service territory of northeastern remc a rural electric cooperative and a member of the wabash valley power association we have not yet elected to enter into any long term electricity supply agreement for this minimill and have been able to effectively use spot market pricing by tailoring our usage to lower cost operating hours if we enter into a longer term agreement however we will be required to arrange power transmission over lines owned by american electric power 

with respect to our pittsboro indiana bar mill the plant is located within the service territory claimed by cinergy formerly known as public service of indiana we have agreed to the terms of an energy supply contract with cinergy under the terms of which we will be purchasing electricity at market rates the contract has been approved by the indiana utility regulatory commission and extends through the end of 2005 

 we use approximately 9000 to 11000 decatherms of natural gas per day in our butler flat roll minimill a decatherm is equivalent to 1 million btus or 1000 cubic feet of natural gas we have a delivery contract with the panhandle eastern pipeline that extends through april 2010 relating to our butler minimill we also have a delivery contract with columbia gas that expires february 2006 and a contract with nipsconifl that extends through october 2005 relating to our butler minimill we maintain a liquid propane storage facility on site in butler with sufficient reserves to sustain operations at our flat roll minimill for approximately one week in the event of an interruption in the natural gas supply 

with respect to our structural steel and rail minimill we have entered into an agreement with nipsco for gas service under its rate schedule 330 which will provide firm burnertip supply and transportation service for all natural gas requirements at this minimill the agreement includes a volumedependent transportation fee and forgoes all balancing charges this agreement precludes the need for a separate pipeline transportation agreement the agreement is for a period of three years beginning with the first use of gas in production we purchased gas at market prices at commencement of operations and we are now minimizing price volatility by entering into hedging transactions on the futures markets

 we have a trademark for the mark “sdi” and an accompanying design of a steel coil and a chevron our iron dynamics subsidiary has filed five patent applications with the us patent and trademark office relating to its methods of producing low sulfur liquid pig iron as of the date of this filing we have received three of those patents 

 at the present time we engage in no third party research and development activities our iron dynamics subsidiary however has been engaged in research and development efforts in connection with its attempts to develop a process for the production of direct reduced iron and the conversion of that product into liquid pig iron most of this research and development effort has been conducted inhouse by iron dynamics’ officers and employees 

 our operations are subject to substantial and evolving local state and federal environmental health and safety laws and regulations concerning among other things emissions to the air discharges to surface and ground water and to sewer systems and the generation handling storage transportation treatment and disposal of toxic and hazardous substances in particular we are dependent upon both state and federal permits regulating discharges into the air or into the water in order to be permitted to operate our facilities we believe that in all current respects our facilities are in material compliance with all provisions of federal and state laws concerning the environment and we do not currently believe that future compliance with such provisions will have a material adverse effect on our results of operations cash flows or financial condition 

since the level of enforcement of environmental laws and regulations or the nature of those laws that may be enacted from time to time are sometimes subject to changing social or political pressures our environmental capital expenditures and costs for environmental compliance may increase in the future in addition due to the possibility of unanticipated regulatory or other developments the amount and timing of future environmental expenditures may vary substantially from those currently anticipated the cost of current and future environmental compliance may also place us steel producers at a competitive disadvantage with respect to foreign steel producers which may not be required to undertake equivalent costs in their operations 

pursuant to the resource conservation and recovery act or rcra which governs the treatment handling and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes the united states environmental protection agency or us epa and authorized state environmental agencies conduct inspections of rcra regulated facilities to identify areas where there may have been releases of solid or hazardous constituents into the environment and require the

facilities to take corrective action to remediate any such releases rcra also allows citizens to bring certain suits against regulated facilities for potential damages and clean up our steelmaking facilities are subject to rcra our manufacturing operations produce various byproducts some of which for example electric arc furnace or eaf dust are categorized as industrial or hazardous waste requiring special handling for disposal or for the recovery of metallics we collect such coproducts in approved baghouses and other facilities but we are also examining alternative reclamation technologies to recycle some of these products the iron dynamics scrap substitute process is an example of such an alternative while we cannot predict the future actions of the regulators or other interested parties the potential exists for required corrective action at these facilities the costs of which could be substantial 

under the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act or cercla the us epa and in some instances private parties have the authority to impose joint and several liability for the remediation of contaminated properties upon generators of waste current and former site owners and operators transporters and other potentially responsible parties regardless of fault or the legality of the original disposal activity many states including indiana have statutes and regulatory authorities similar to cercla and to the us epa we have a number of waste handling agreements with various contractors to properly dispose of our electric arc furnace dust and certain other waste products of steelmaking however we cannot assure you that even if there has been no fault by us we may not still be cited as a waste generator by reason of an environmental clean up at a site to which our waste products were transported 

in addition to rcra and cercla there are a number of other environmental health and safety laws and regulations that apply to our facilities and may affect our operations by way of example and not of limitation certain portions of the federal clean air act clean water act oil pollution act safe drinking water act and emergency planning and community righttoknow act as well as state and local laws and regulations implemented by the regulatory agencies apply to our facilities’ operations many of these laws allow both the governments and citizens to bring certain suits against regulated facilities for alleged environmental violations finally any steelmaking company could be subject to certain toxic tort suits brought by citizens or other third parties alleging causes of action such as nuisance negligence trespass infliction of emotional distress or other claims alleging personal injury or property damage 

 our work force consisted of 1645 employees at december 31 2004 none of steel dynamics’ employees are represented by labor unions we believe that our relationship with our employees is good

 we are a domestic steel manufacturing company that primarily owns and operates electric arc furnace minimills our steel operations include a flat roll division a structural and rail division and a bar products division 

our steel divisions operate technologically advanced minimills producing steel from steel scrap using electric arc melting furnaces continuous casting and automated rolling mills the flat roll division sells a broad range of hotrolled coldrolled and coated steel products including a large variety of specialty products such as thinner gauge hotrolled products galvanized products and painted products the structural and rail division sells structural steel beams pilings and other steel components this facility is also designed to produce and sell a variety of standard and premiumgrade rail for the railroad industry during the fourth quarter of 2004 the division shipped its first industrialquality rail and anticipates shipping standard rail during the first half of 2005 the bar products division currently sells special barquality and merchant barquality rounds and roundcornered squares the divisions sell directly to endusers and service centers these products are used in numerous industry sectors including the automotive construction commercial transportation and industrial machinery markets

the flat roll division’s revenues as a percentage of total consolidated net sales declined throughout the last three years as a result of our growth as shown on the charts below our structural and rail division commenced operations in the third quarter of 2002 and our bar products division began operations on december 29 2003 the following graphs depict our product mix of consolidated shipments by division during the past three years 

our product mix has become more diversified during the last three years and we expect it to continue to move toward higher valueadded products during 2005 with the addition of standard and premium rail and the continued production increases at our bar products division the following table depicts our product mix of total shipments by major product group during the past three years 

 

metallic raw materials used in our electric arc furnaces represent our singlemost significant manufacturing cost and historically has generally accounted for between 45 and 50 of our consolidated cost of goods sold however due to increasing metallic raw material costs this percentage climbed to 65 during 2004 the metallic raw material mix utilized in our electric arc furnaces is generally composed of approximately 85 steel scrap and 15 alternative iron units from the second quarter of 2000 throughout 2001 we experienced a steady decline in metallic raw material pricing reaching historically low levels in the fourth quarter of 2001 however during 2002 and through current markets we have experienced a steady pricing increase metallic raw material costs are now at historical highs we believe the volatility of the metallic market necessitates the generation of a

cost effective alternative iron source we believe iron dynamics and our investment in the mesabi nugget joint venture are important inroads in helping control our costs related to pig iron and steel scrap 

iron dynamics our wholly owned subsidiary involves the pioneering of a process to produce direct reduced iron to compact that material to form hotbriquetted iron hbi and to then convert the hbi into liquid pig iron hbi and liquid pig iron are high quality steel scrap substitutes that can be used in our electric arc furnaces during 1999 idi commenced initial startup and produced and sold a minimal amount of liquid pig iron to the company’s flat roll division however it was determined that idi would require certain design and equipment modifications to attain its fully intended operating functionality these modifications occurred during the second half of 2000 with completion and restart occurring in the first quarter of 2001 while idi believed that many of the design and equipment deficiencies were corrected with these modifications the company halted operations at idi during july 2001 as a result of higherthanexpected startup and process refinement costs lowerthanexpected production quantities exceptionally high energy costs and then historically low steel scrap pricing during the fourth quarter of 2002 idi successfully completed certain operating trials utilizing a modified production process this process reduced the perunit cost of liquid pig iron production throughout 2003 the company invested 133 million for capital expenditures required to implement this modified production process and iron dynamics restarted operations midnovember 2003 during 2004 idi produced 173000 tonnes of hot briquetted iron and after starting the submerged arc furnace in june produced 47000 tonnes of liquid pig iron during the second half of 2004 

we are one of four investors in mesabi nugget llc an entity that is also pioneering a process to produce an iron substitute in the form of nuggets or small pellets a pilot plant successfully implemented the process and verified its validity we are currently working with the other investors to proceed with a commercialscale plant that has an estimated annual production capacity of 500000 tonnes of iron nuggets 

 net sales our total net sales are a factor of net tons shipped product mix and related pricing our net sales are determined by subtracting product returns sales discounts return allowances and claims from total sales we charge premium prices for certain grades of steel dimensions of product or certain smaller volumes based on our cost of production we also charge marginally higher prices for our valueadded products these products include hotrolled and coldrolled galvanized products coldrolled products and painted products from our flat roll division and certain special bar quality products from our bar products division 

cost of goods sold our cost of goods sold represents all direct and indirect costs associated with the manufacture of our products the principal elements of these costs are steel scrap and scrap substitutes alloys natural gas argon direct and indirect labor and related benefits electricity oxygen electrodes depreciation materials and transportation and freight our metallic raw materials steel scrap and scrap substitutes represent the most significant component of our cost of goods sold 

selling general and administrative expenses selling general and administrative expenses consist of all costs associated with our sales finance and accounting and administrative departments these costs include labor and benefits professional services financing cost amortization property taxes profitsharing expense and startup costs associated with new projects 

interest expense interest expense consists of interest associated with our senior credit facilities and other debt agreements as described in the notes to our financial statements contained elsewhere in this filing net of capitalized interest costs that are related to construction expenditures during the construction period of capital projects 

other income expense other income consists of interest income earned on our cash balances and any other nonoperating income activity including gains on certain shortterm investments other expense consists of any nonoperating costs including settlement costs from litigation efforts

 net income was 2953 million or 527 per diluted shared during 2004 compared with 471 million or 91 per diluted share during 2003 this increase in our net income during 2004 was due to increased selling values and shipping volumes 

gross profit during 2004 our net sales increased 12 billion or 117 to 21 billion and our consolidated shipments increased 615000 tons or 22 to 34 million tons compared with 2003 the increase in consolidated shipments was primarily due to increased shipments to external customers of 316000 tons from our bar products division which started commercial operations during the first quarter of 2004 and an increase of 268000 tons from our structural and rail division which completed its second full year of operations our average consolidated selling price for 2004 increased 79 to 625 per ton compared with 2003 as shown in the following table our quarterly pricing has continued to increase during the year and we anticipate a slight increase to continue into the first quarter of 2005 

 we continue to see signs of a strengthening us economy and we experienced a related increase in demand and product basepricing during 2004 however our increase in selling values during that time was also due in part to the steel industry’s initiation of a surcharge mechanism at the beginning of 2004 this surcharge is derived from an indexed scrap number and designed to pass some of the increased costs associated with rising metallic prices through to the industry’s customers 

our average annual 2004 metallic raw material cost per net ton charged increased 115 when compared with 2003 the following table shows the quarterly increases in our cost of metallic raw materials per net ton charged throughout 2004 

 

metallic raw materials specifically steel scrap and scrap substitutes represent the most significant cost component of our steel operation’s production processes as a percentage of total cost of goods sold during 2004 these costs represented 65 an increase of 13 compared with 2003 this increase in the cost of our primary raw material as a percentage of our total manufacturing costs necessitated the surcharge we anticipate a decrease in our raw material costs during the first quarter of 2005 due to reduced steel scrap pricing already experienced during the quarter if these costs fall from historical highs the surcharge will also decline and may eventually cease to be utilized in our product price determination however our product baseprices will continue to fluctuate with market demand 

selling general and administrative expenses selling general and administrative expenses were 966 million during 2004 as compared to 487 million during 2003 an increase of 479 million or 98 this increase was primarily attributed to increased profit sharing expense of 277 million which correlates to the increase in our pretax earnings our profit sharing pool is calculated as a percentage of our pretax earnings during 2003 and the first half of 2004 the profit sharing pool was based on 5 of pretax earnings during the second half of 2004 upon approval of our board of directors the allocation was increased to 6 during 2004 and 2003 selling general and administrative expense represented 5 of net sales 

interest expense during 2004 gross interest expense increased 8 to 458 million and capitalized interest decreased 885000 to 69 million as compared to 2003 during 2004 we recorded interest expense of 60 million in conjunction with a onetime shortterm us treasury bond transaction the interest capitalization that occurred during 2004 resulted from the interest required to be capitalized with respect to construction activities at our bar products and structural and rail divisions

other income expense other income was 70 million during 2004 as compared to other expense of 664000 during 2003 during the first quarter of 2004 we entered into a shortterm us treasury bond transaction to generate net interest income in an increasing interest rate environment and to generate capital gains this transaction was completed during the fourth quarter and we recorded associated gains of 54 million during 2004 we also recorded a 10 million gain from the early extinguishment of debt associated with our structural and rail division during the second quarter of 2004 

income taxes during 2004 our income tax provision was 1797 million as compared to 283 million during 2003 our effective income tax rate was 375 throughout 2003 and for the first half of 2004 we fully utilized all of our existing net operating loss carryforwards and capital loss carryforwards during 2004 we increased our effective income tax rate to 380 effective july 1 2004 due to increased profitability during the year we again increased our effective income tax rate to 385 beginning january 1 2005 in anticipation of the year’s expected profitability levels and the resulting impact on our state income taxes 

 net income was 471 million or 91 per diluted shared during 2003 compared with 779 million or 164 per diluted share during 2002 this decrease in our net income during 2003 was due to dramatically increased costs of our metallic raw materials steel scrap and scrap substitute 

gross profit during 2003 our consolidated net sales increased 1228 million or 14 to 9872 million and our consolidated shipments increased 427000 tons or 18 to 28 million tons compared with 2002 these increases were due primarily to 2003 being the first full year of operations for our structural and rail division we had structural sales to external customers of 1455 million and shipments of 462000 tons during 2003 a 1280 million increase in sales and 401000 ton increase in shipments from 2002 structural products accounted for 16 of our consolidated shipments during 2003 compared to 3 during 2002 

our average consolidated selling price decreased 12 per ton to 350 per ton during 2003 our flat roll division accounted for 77 of our consolidated net sales during 2003 and its pricing decreased approximately 11 per ton compared to 2002 domestic flatrolled steel product pricing decreased during the first half of 2003 compared to the last half of 2002 due in part to the weakened economy and added domestic flatrolled production capacity 

cost of goods sold increased 1950 million or 30 during 2003 to 8419 million compared with 2002 as a percentage of net sales cost of goods sold represented approximately 85 and 75 during the years 2003 and 2002 respectively we experienced a narrowing of our gross margin throughout 2003 as our average sales price per ton increased more slowly than our average metallic raw material cost per ton which is the most significant single component of our cost of goods sold metallic raw materials represented 52 and 47 of our cost of goods sold during 2003 and 2002 respectively we experienced a steady increase in metallic costs from the first quarter of 2002 through the end of 2003 and we anticipated further increases during the first half of 2004 our metallic raw material cost increased 29 per net ton charged during 2003 while our average consolidated sales price decreased 12 per ton 

selling general and administrative expenses selling general and administrative expenses were 487 million or 5 of net sales during 2003 as compared to 592 million or 7 of net sales during 2002 a portion of these expenses in both years was attributable to performancerelated employee incentive programs and facility startup costs costs associated with our performancerelated employee profitsharing plan decreased 33 million during 2003 as compared to 2002 which was a record year for pretax income prior to 2004 results during 2003 costs associated with startup activities at our bar products division principally were 79 million compared to startup costs during 2002 of 132 million which related most significantly to our structural and rail division

interest expense interest expense was 345 million during 2003 as compared to 302 million during 2002 an increase of 43 million or 14 this increase in our net interest expense during 2003 was due to a decrease of 36 million in interest required to be capitalized in connection with our construction projects our gross interest expense remained relatively flat at 423 million during 2003 

gain from debt extinguishment in january 2002 we entered into an agreement with the iron dynamics’ lenders to extinguish the debt under the idi senior secured credit agreement at the end of march 2002 there was a provision within the agreement that if iron dynamics resumed operations by january 27 2007 and generated positive cash flow as defined in the settlement agreement we would be required to make contingent future payments in an aggregate amount not to exceed 220 million during december 2003 by agreement with the iron dynamics’ lenders we paid 80 million in cash to the idi lenders terminating all of our obligations to make any additional future payments under the settlement agreement our 2003 financial statements reflect an ordinary noncash gain of 140 million from the extinguishment of the 220 million contingent liability 

other income expense other expense was 664000 during 2003 as compared to 37 million during 2002 during 2002 we recorded settlement costs of 45 million net of insurance proceeds in association with the nsmrelated lawsuits 

income taxes during 2003 our income tax provision was 283 million as compared to 466 million during 2002 our effective tax rate was 375 and 374 for 2003 and 2002 respectively during 2003 we realized a 19 million valuation allowance that was created in 2001 for foreign tax credit carryforwards 

 our business is capital intensive and requires substantial expenditures for among other things the purchase and maintenance of equipment used in our steelmaking and finishing operations and to remain in compliance with environmental laws our shortterm and longterm liquidity needs arise primarily from capital expenditures working capital requirements and principal and interest payments related to our outstanding indebtedness we have met these liquidity requirements with cash provided by operations equity longterm borrowings state and local grants and capital cost reimbursements 

working capital during 2004 our operational working capital position representing our cash invested in trade receivables and inventories less trade payables and accruals increased 2357 million to 4089 million compared to december 31 2003 due to higher selling prices and increased sales volume trade receivables increased 1278 million during 2004 to 2539 million of which 97 were current or less than 60 days past due our largest customer is an affiliated company heidtman steel which represented 15 and 20 of our outstanding trade receivables at december 31 2004 and 2003 respectively during 2004 our inventories increased 1970 million to 3815 million due primarily to the increased cost and volume of our metallic raw materials onhand and also to the startup production of our bar products division our metallic raw materials onhand increased 267000 tons or 1123 million at december 31 2004 compared to december 31 2003 metallic scrap prices decreased during december therefore we purchased some additional inventories for future use to benefit from these reduced costs our trade payables increased 626 million during 2004 a significant portion of which was associated with the amount we owed various vendors for metallic raw material purchases 

capital expenditures during 2004 we invested 1020 million in property plant and equipment related to our new divisions and improvement projects in our existing facilities approximately 50 of our capital investments were related to the conversion of our bar products division and 17 were related to the expansion of our new millennium joist and deck operations with the addition of its second plant we believe these capital investments will increase our net sales and related cash flows as each project continues to develop 

capital resources during 2004 our total outstanding debt including unamortized bond premium decreased by 1592 million to 4484 million our longterm debt to capitalization ratio decreased from 50 at the end of 2003 to 34 at december 31 2004 we prepaid several state and local government bond issues

electric utility loans and new millennium’s credit facility as well as reducing our senior secured debt by 100 million during october 2004 

on june 30 2004 we completed a refinancing of our senior secured credit facilities and entered into a new 4year 230 million senior secured revolving credit facility our senior secured credit agreement is secured by liens and mortgages on substantially all of our personal and real property assets by liens and mortgages on substantially all of the personal and real property assets of our whollyowned subsidiaries and by pledges of all shares of capital stock and intercompany debt held by us and each whollyowned subsidiary in addition our whollyowned subsidiaries have guaranteed our obligations under the senior secured credit agreement the senior secured credit agreement contains financial covenants and other covenants that limit or restrict our ability to make capital expenditures incur indebtedness permit liens on our property enter into transactions with affiliates make restricted payments or investments enter into mergers acquisitions or consolidations conduct asset sales pay dividends or distributions and enter into other specified transactions and activities our ability to draw down the revolver is dependent upon our continued compliance with the financial covenants and other covenants contained in our senior secured credit agreement we were in compliance with these covenants at december 31 2004 and expect to remain in compliance during the next twelve months 

due to the increasing interest rate environment during 2004 and anticipated in 2005 we entered into two forward interest rate agreements during january 2005 to lock the sixmonth libor setting of our 200 million fair value interest rate swap which resets each march and september at sixmonth libor in arrears plus 57 we locked the sixmonth libor in arrears settings at 31 for the interest reset date of march 15 2005 and at 37 for the interest reset date of september 15 2005 

our new senior secured credit agreement allows us to pay cash dividends dependent upon our continued compliance with the financial covenants and other covenants within the agreement during the fourth quarter our board of directors declared our third cash dividend the dividend of 10 ten cents per common share was paid on january 17 2005 to shareholders of record at the close of business on december 31 2004 the aggregate dividend payment was 42 million on october 26 2004 we also announced our board of directors approved the repurchase of up to 5 million shares of our common stock to be made from time to time based upon the market price of our stock the nature of other investment opportunities present our cash flows from operations and general economic conditions we terminated our existing share repurchase plan and amended our senior secured credit facility as a result of this approval at december 31 2004 we had repurchased 16 million shares in the open market at an average price of 35 per share we repurchased an additional 10 million shares from january 4 2005 through january 26 2005 at an average of price of 35 per share we have approximately 24 million shares still authorized to be repurchased pursuant to our current share repurchase plan 

in january 2002 we entered into an agreement with the iron dynamics’ lenders to extinguish its senior secured debt of 590 million during march 2002 the settlement agreement required us to pay 150 million in cash and issue an aggregate of 220 million of steel dynamics common stock to the lender group in addition there was a provision within the agreement that if iron dynamics resumed operations by january 27 2007 and generated positive cash flow we would be required to make payments to the iron dynamics lenders in an aggregate amount not to exceed the remaining unpaid 220 million thus potentially requiring the repayment of the entire 590 million outstanding 

we complied with each of the settlement requirements thus constituting full and final settlement of all of iron dynamics’ obligations and the steel dynamics’ guarantees under the iron dynamics credit agreement at december 31 2002 the contingent future payments were reflected as an other longterm contingent liability within our financial statements pursuant to generally accepted accounting principles which in this circumstance would not allow a gain or loss to be recorded on the restructured payable as long as there was a possibility of the lenders being repaid in full during december 2003 by agreement with the iron dynamics’ lenders we paid 80 million in cash to the iron dynamics’ lenders terminating all of our obligations to make any additional

future payments under the settlement agreement therefore our 2003 financial statements reflect a noncash gain of 140 million from the extinguishment of the 220 million contingent liability 

our ability to meet our debt service obligations and reduce our total debt will depend upon our future performance which in turn will depend upon general economic financial and business conditions along with competition legislation and regulation factors that are largely beyond our control in addition we cannot assure you that our operating results cash flow and capital resources will be sufficient for repayment of our indebtedness in the future we believe that based upon current levels of operations and anticipated growth cash flow from operations together with other available sources of funds including additional borrowings under our senior secured credit agreement will be adequate for the next two years for making required payments of principal and interest on our indebtedness funding working capital requirements and funding anticipated capital expenditures during 2005 we anticipate spending approximately 160 million on capital expenditures with approximately 60 million to 80 million in connection with a joint venture investment in the commercial development of a scrap substitute facility utilizing the mesabi nugget project technology 35 million in connection our the expansion of our new millennium building systems operations with the completion of its second plant and the initiation of is third plant 45 million in connection with various smaller individual projects at our flat roll structural and rail and bar products divisions and 5 million related to operations at iron dynamics at december 31 2004 we had outstanding contractual obligations of 175 million related to these planned capital expenditures 

during 2004 we received benefits from state and local governments in the form of real estate and personal property tax abatements and credits of approximately 70 million based on our current abatements and utilizing our existing longlived asset structure we estimate the remaining annual effect on future operations to be approximately 56 million 45 million 40 million 34 million 28 million 16 million 13 million 12 million and 77000 during the years 2005 through 2013 respectively 

contractual obligations and other longterm liabilities we have the following minimum commitments under contractual obligations including purchase obligations as defined by the us securities and exchange commission a “purchase obligation” is defined as an agreement to purchase goods or services that is enforceable and legally binding and that specifies all significant terms including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased fixed minimum or variable price provisions and the approximate timing of the transaction other longterm liabilities are defined as longterm liabilities that are reflected on our balance sheet under generally accepted account principles based on this definition the following table includes only those contracts which include fixed or minimum obligations it does not include normal purchases which are made in the ordinary course of business the following table provides aggregated information about outstanding contractual obligations and other longterm liabilities as of december 31 2004 dollars in thousands

       we believe that inflation has not had a material effect on our results of operations 

 we have incurred and in the future will continue to incur capital expenditures and operating expenses for matters relating to environmental control remediation monitoring and compliance during 2004 we incurred costs related to the monitoring and compliance of environmental matters in the amount of 128 million and capital expenditures related to environmental compliance of 10 million approximately 64 of the costs incurred during 2004 for monitoring and compliance were related to the normal transportation of certain types of waste produced in the steelmaking process in accordance with legal requirements no environmental remediation costs were incurred during 2004 and there were no outstanding contingent matters related to environmental remediation therefore there were no related accruals recorded at december 31 2004 we believe apart from our dependence on environmental construction and operating permits for our existing and proposed manufacturing facilities that compliance with current environmental laws and regulations is not likely to have a materially adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or liquidity however environmental laws and regulations have changed rapidly in recent years and we may become subject to more stringent environmental laws and regulations in the future 

 in december 2004 the fasb issued fas no 123r fas 123r “sharebased payment” a revision of fas 123 supersedes apb 25 and amends fas 95 “statement of cash flows” among other items fas 123r eliminates the use of apb 25 and the intrinsic value method of accounting and requires companies to recognize the cost of employee services received in exchange for awards of equity instruments based on the grant date fair value of those awards in the financial statements the effective date of fas 123r is the first reporting period beginning after june 15 2005 which for us is the third quarter of 2005 fas 123r permits companies to adopt its requirements using either a “modified prospective” method or a “modified retrospective” method under the “modified prospective” method compensation cost is recognized in the financial statements beginning with the effective date based on the requirements of fas 123r for all sharebased payments granted after that date and based on the requirements of fas 123 for all unvested awards granted prior to the effective date of fas 123r

under the “modified retrospective” method the requirements are the same but also permit entities to restate financial statements of previous period based on proforma disclosures made in accordance with fas 123 

we currently utilize the blackscholes standard option pricing model to measure the fair value of stock options granted to employees fas 123r permits companies to continue to use such a model or to use a “lattice” model we have not yet determined which model we will use to measure the fair value of employee stock options upon the adoption of fas 123r we expect to adopt fas 123r effective july 1 2005 

in november 2004 the fasb issued statement no 151 fas 151 “inventory costs an amendment of arb no 43 chapter 4” fas 151 clarifies that abnormal amounts of idle facility expense freight handling costs and wasted materials spoilage should be recognized as current period charges in addition fas 151 requires that allocation of fixed production overhead to inventory be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities fas 151 is effective for inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning after june 15 2005 we currently believe that the adoption of fas 151 will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 

in september 2004 the eitf reached a consensus on eitf issue no 048 “the effect of contingently convertible instruments on diluted earnings per share” this issue requires that contingently convertible debt securities with a market price trigger be included in the computation of diluted earrings per share regardless of whether the market price trigger has been met eitf 048 is effective for all periods ending after december 15 2004 and requires retroactive restatement of previously reported earnings per share we adopted eitf 048 during the fourth quarter of 2004 and restated our diluted earnings per share for the years ended december 31 2003 and 2002 to include the potentially dilutive effect of the company’s 115 million subordinated convertible notes of which 100 million were issued in december 2002 and 15 million were issued in january 2003 

in march 2004 the eitf reached a consensus on eitf issue no 0316 “accounting for investments in limited liability companies” effective for reporting periods beginning after june 15 2004 the issue relates to the accounting by the investor for investments in the common stock of limited liability companies that are not consolidated the eitf concluded that an investment in a limited liability company that maintains a specific ownership account for each investor similar to a partnership capital account structure should be viewed as similar to an investment in a limited partnership for purposes of determining whether a noncontrolling investment in a limited liability company should be accounted for using the cost method or the equity method we adopted eitf 0316 during the third quarter of 2004 with no material impact to our consolidated financial statements 

in january 2003 the fasb issued interpretation no 46 revised december 2003 fin 46r “consolidation of variable interest entities an interpretation of arb no 51” fin 46r provides a new framework for identifying variable interest entities vies and determining when a company should include the assets liabilities noncontrolling interests and results of activities of a vie in its consolidated financial statements and provides guidance related to a company’s initial and subsequent measurement of newly consolidated vies in general a vie is a corporation partnership limitedliability corporation trust or any other legal structure used to conduct activities or hold assets that either has an insufficient amount of equity to carry out is principal activities without additional subordinated financial support a group of equity owners that are unable to make significant decisions about its activities or a group of equity owners that do not have the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive returns generated by its operations 

fin 46r requires a vie to be consolidated if a party with an ownership contractual or other financial interest in the vie is obligated to absorb a majority of the risk of loss from the vie’s activities is entitled to receive a majority of the vie’s residual returns or both fin 46r must be applied to all entities subject to this interpretation as of march 31 2004 however prior to the required application of this interpretation fin 46r must be applied to those entities that are considered to be specialpurpose entities as of december 31 2003 there was no financial statement impact from the application of this interpretation

 management’s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america we review the accounting policies we use in reporting our financial results on a regular basis the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities we evaluate the appropriateness of these estimations and judgments on an ongoing basis we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources results may differ from these estimates due to actual outcomes being different from those on which we based our assumptions we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 

revenue recognition and allowance for doubtful accounts we recognize revenues from sales and the allowance for estimated costs associated with returns from these sales when the title of the product transfers upon shipment provision is made for estimated product returns and customer claims based on estimates and actual historical experience if the historical data used in our estimates does not reflect future returns and claims trends additional provision may be necessary our steel joist and steel decking operation new millennium building systems recognizes revenues from construction contracts on a percentage of completion method based on steel consumed to date as a percentage of the estimated total steel required for each contract new millennium accounted for 4 of our 2004 net sales 

we are exposed to credit risk in the event of nonpayment by our customers which are principally intermediate steel processors and service centers that sell our products to numerous industry sectors including the automotive construction commercial transportation and industrial machinery markets we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments based on known credit risks historical loss experience and current economic conditions affecting our customers we mitigate our exposure to credit risk by performing ongoing credit evaluations and taking further action when necessary such as requiring letters of credit or other security interests to support the receivable from our customer if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate resulting in the impairment of their ability to make payments additional allowance may be required 

impairments of longlived assets in accordance with the methodology described in fasb statement no 144 “accounting for the impairment or disposal of longlived assets” we review longlived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable impairment losses are recorded on longlived assets used in operations when indicators of impairment are present and the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than the assets’ carrying amounts the impairment loss is measured by comparing the fair value of the asset to its carrying amount 

deferred tax assets and liabilities we are required to estimate our income taxes as a part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements this requires us to estimate our actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatments of items for tax and accounting purposes these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities which are included within our consolidated balance sheet we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely we must establish a valuation allowance during 2003 we were unable to utilize a 3 million foreign tax credit carryforward which we had created a valuation allowance of 2 million for in 2001 therefore the valuation allowance was realized in 2003 as of december 31 2004 we had no net operating loss carryforwards or capital loss carryforwards available

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

tableend  in the normal course of business we are exposed to interest rate changes our objectives in managing exposure to interest rate changes are to limit the impact of these rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower overall borrowing costs to achieve these objectives we primarily use interest rate swaps to manage net exposure to interest rate changes related to our portfolio of borrowings we generally maintain fixed rate debt as a percentage of our net debt between a minimum and maximum percentage a portion of our debt has an interest component that resets on a periodic basis to reflect current market conditions the following table represents the principal cash repayments and related weightedaverage interest rates by maturity date for our longterm debt as of december 31 2004 in thousands 

  in the normal course of business we are exposed to the market risk and price fluctuations related to the sale of steel products and to the purchase of commodities used in our production process such as metallic raw materials electricity natural gas and alloys our risk strategy associated with product sales has generally been to obtain competitive prices for our products and to allow operating results to reflect market price movements dictated by supply and demand during 2004 approximately 11 of our net sales were under fixedprice contracts with greater than twelve month commitments 

our risk strategy associated with the purchase of commodities utilized within our production process has generally been to make certain commitments with suppliers relating to future expected requirements for such commodities certain of these commitments contain provisions which require us to “take or pay” for specified quantities without regard to actual usage for periods of up to 2 years during the years ending december 31 2005 and 2006 we have commitments for natural gas and its transportation with “take or pay” or other similar commitment provisions for approximately 158 million and 24 million respectively we fully utilized all such “take or pay” requirements during the past three years and purchased 205 million 169 million and 140 million during the years ended december 31 2004 2003 and 2002 respectively under these contracts we believe that our production requirements will be such that consumption of the products or services purchased under these commitments will occur in the normal production process 

we also purchase electricity consumed at our flat roll division pursuant to a contract which extends through december 2007 the contract designates 140 hours as “interruptible service” during 2005 and these interruptible hours further decrease annually through expiration of the agreement the contract also establishes an agreed fixed rate energy charge per millkwh consumed for each year through the expiration of the agreement

item 1   business

our company

overview

     we are a steel manufacturing company that owns and operates three
steelmaking minimills we produce our steel principally from steel scrap using
electric arc melting furnaces continuous casting and automated rolling mills

     during 2003 our sales were 987 million and at yearend we had
approximately 1400 employees none of our employees are represented by labor
unions

     flat roll division

     we own and operate a flatroll minimill located in butler indiana which
produces sheet steel and which we built and have operated since 1996 this mill
has an annual production capacity of 22 million tons of flatrolled steel
although we actually produced 24 million tons during 2003 we produce a broad
range of high quality hotrolled coldrolled and coated steel products
including a large variety of high valueadded and high margin specialty products
such as thinner gauge rolled products and galvanized products we sell our
flatrolled products directly to endusers intermediate steel processors and
service centers primarily in the midwestern united states our products are used
in numerous industry sectors including the automotive construction and
commercial industries

     in may 2002 we announced plans to construct a new inplant painting
facility at our butler minimill and we completed this facility and commenced
coating operations in november 2003 this 25 million facility has the capacity
to coat approximately 240000 tons of steel

     in march 2003 we also purchased the assets of a coating facility formerly
owned by galvpro ii llc in jeffersonville indiana for a purchase price of
175 million plus a potential of an additional 15 million based on an
earnout formula we anticipate that this facility will be capable of producing
between 300000 and 350000 tons per year of lightgauge hotdipped coldrolled
galvanized steel we operate this new facility as a part of our butler indiana
flat roll division which will also supply the jeffersonville plant with steel
coils for coating production began at jeffersonville in july 2003 our new
jeffersonville facility together with our new coilcoating facility in butler
will enable us to further increase the mix of highermargin valueadded
downstream steel products this valueadded product mix during 2002 and 2003
was approximately 60 of our total flatroll shipments

                                       3

     structural steel and rail division

     we also own and operate a new structural steel and rail minimill in
columbia city indiana we began construction in may 2001 completed plant
construction in april 2002 and commenced commercial structural steel operations
during the third quarter of 2002 our columbia city minimill is designed to
have an annual production capacity of up to 13 million tons of structural steel
beams pilings and other steel components for the construction transportation
and industrial machinery markets as well as standard and premium grade rails
for the railroad industry through regular product introductions and continued
production rampup of structural steel products we were able to begin to offer
a broad array of wide flange beams and hpiling structural steel products during
2003 and were able to commission most of the rest of our product line save for
6 inch and 36 inch beams which we hope to commission during the first quarter
of 2004 in addition we performed casting trials for the production of standard
rail products during the first quarter of 2003 and since that time have
successfully run product through the breakdown mill tandem mill cooling bed
and straightener we anticipate having finished rail product during the second
quarter of 2004 which we will provide to the railroad companies to be tested
and monitored for product evaluation this evaluation process may take between
six and nine months

     bar products division

     on september 6 2002 we purchased the special bar quality minimill assets
in pittsboro indiana formerly owned by qualitech steel sbq llc we paid 45
million for these assets worked during 2003 to upgrade redesign and retrofit
the facility for the production of a variety of merchant bar quality or mbq
products such as angles flats rounds and other merchant bars and shapes as
well as reinforcing bar or rebar products and also for the production of some
special bar quality or sbq products when fully complete we expect to have
invested between 75 and 80 million of additional capital in this facility we
started melting and casting operations in middecember and began shipping
limited products by yearend 2003 currently we are producing bigger bars both
mbq and sbq and expect equipment to arrive during the first quarter of 2004
which will enable us during the second quarter to produce the smaller rounds
angles flats channels and products of that nature we expect the pittsboro
facility to have a capacity of approximately 500000 to 600000 tons per year

     iron dynamics scrap substitute facility

     on february 24 2003 we announced our intention to restart ironmaking
operations at our whollyowned iron dynamics facility adjacent to our butler
indiana minimill since 1997 we have tried to develop and commercialize a
pioneering process for the production of a virgin form of iron that could serve
as a lower cost substitute for a portion of the metallic raw material mix that
goes into our electric arc furnaces to be melted into new steel since initial
startup in august 1999 we encountered a number of equipment design and
process difficulties and on several occasions during 1999 and 2000 shut the
facility down for redesign reengineering and retrofitting in july 2001 we
suspended operations because of higher than expected startup and process
refinement costs high energy costs prevailing at that time low production
quantities and historically low steel scrap pricing existing at that time
these factors made the cost of producing and using our iron dynamics scrap
substitute as a source of metallics for the melt mix at our flat roll division
higher than our cost of purchasing and using steel scrap

     we continued to make refinements to our systems and processes and began
experimental production trials in the fourth quarter of 2002 after an
evaluation of these production trials we concluded that improved production
technology coupled with our new ability to recycle waste materials as a raw
material input and the increasingly higher price of scrap made the restart of
this production facility feasible during 2003 we spent approximately 13
million of additional capital for modifications and refinements to the iron
dynamics operation we restarted the rotary hearth furnace or front end of the
process in november 2003 and during december 2003 produced 15100 tonnes of
direct reduced iron which we then compacted or briquetted to form hot
briquetted iron or hbi we anticipate ramping hbi production up to
approximately 3035000 tonnes of hbi per month by the end of the second quarter
of 2004 all of which we plan to use at our butler flatroll mill we have not
yet restarted the smelting end of the iron dynamics process the conversion of
hbi into liquid pig iron but we anticipate restarting the submerged arc furnace
by the end of the first quarter or the beginning of the second quarter of 2004

     mesabi nugget project

     in march 2002 we formed a joint venture with certain entities owned by
kobe steel ltd clevelandcliffs inc and ferrometrics inc to assist in
the development of a proprietary process owned by kobe known as itmk3 for
the production of a fully metallized iron nugget product suitable as an
alternative iron or scrap substitute feedstock in electric arc furnace
steelmaking we hold an approximate 18 equity interest in a pilot plant in
operation in minnesota that is working to validate and refine the technology
which consists of superheating direct reduced iron pellets liquefying the
material separating the slag and the iron and chilling the resulting material
to produce a highly pure iron nugget

     new millennium building systems

     during the first quarter of 2003 we increased our ownership in our
consolidated new millennium building systems subsidiary from 466 ownership
interest to 100 through the acquisition of the 466 interest in new
millennium previously held by new process steel corporation a privately held
houston texas steel processor and the purchase of the remaining 68 stake held
by some of new millenniums managers we consummated the 466 new process
acquisition at a cost of 35 million plus the purchase of new process steels
portion of new millenniums subordinated notes payable including accrued
interest for 39 million and we also consummated the purchase of the
remaining 68 minority interest at a purchase price of 900000

     the new millennium facility which began production in june of 2000
produces steel building components including joists girders trusses and steel
roof and floor decking which we sell primarily in the upper midwest
nonresidential building components market our flat roll division supplies a
majority of the hotrolled steel utilized in new millenniums manufacturing
operations

     we were incorporated in august 1993 in indiana and maintain our principal
executive offices at 6714 pointe inverness way suite 200 fort wayne indiana
46804 our telephone number is 260 4593553

     financing

     in march 2002 we consummated a 3500 million senior secured credit
agreement consisting of a five year 750 million revolving credit facility a
700 million term a loan with a term of five years and a 2050 million term
b loan with a term of six years this senior secured facility is secured by
liens and mortgages on substantially all of our personal and real property
assets and by liens and mortgages on substantially all of the personal and real
property assets of our whollyowned subsidiaries excluding new millennium
which have also guaranteed our obligations under that facility

     also in march 2002 we issued 2000 million of 9 12 unsecured senior
notes due 2009 and in november 2003 we issued an additional 1000 million of
the same 9 12 unsecured senior notes due 2009 in offerings exempt from
registration under the securities act of 1933 approximately 500 million of
the net proceeds from this offering were used to prepay a portion of our senior
secured term b loan pursuant to a registration rights agreement between us and
the initial purchasers of the notes who resold the notes in offerings exempt
from registration under rule 144a under the securities act we registered an
exchange offer on form s4 to enable the holders of the initial 2000 million
of unregistered notes and we are also obligated to register an exchange offer
for the 1000 million addon as well

     during december 2002 and january 2003 we also issued 1150 million of our
4 convertible subordinated notes due 2012 in an offering exempt from
registration under the securities act of 1933 pursuant to a registration rights
agreement between us and the initial purchasers of the notes who resold the
notes in offerings exempt from registration under rule 144a under the securities
act we filed a registration statement on form s3 on march 7 2003 effective
june 11 2003 to permit registered resales by the selling securityholders of
the notes as well as the approximately 6762874 shares of common stock
initially issuable upon conversion of the notes approximately 1100 million of
the net proceeds from this offering were used to prepay in full our 700
million senior secured term a loan and 400 million of our senior secured term
b loan in december 2002 and january 2003 as described herein under the terms
of the convertible note offering holders of the notes have the right to convert
their notes into shares of our common stock at a conversion rate of 588076
shares per 1000 principal amount of notes equivalent to an initial conversion
price of approximately 170046 per share subject to adjustment if among
other designated circumstances during any fiscal quarter commencing after
december 31 2002 the closing sale price of our common stock exceeds 120 of
the conversion price 204055 for at least 20 trading days in the 30
consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of any fiscal quarter

     competitive strengths

     we believe that we have the following competitive strengths

                                       5
page

     one of the lowest cost producers in the united states stateoftheart
facilities

     we believe that our facilities are among the lowestcost steel
manufacturing facilities in the united states operating profit per ton shipped
at our facilities which we define as consolidated operating income before
startup costs and minority interest adjustments divided by consolidated net ton
shipments was 23 74 and 37 in 2001 2002 and 2003 respectively which we
believe compares favorably with our competitors our low operating costs are
primarily a result of our efficient plant designs and operations our high
productivity rate of between 03 to 04 man hours per ton at our flat roll
divisions minimill low ongoing maintenance cost requirements and strategic
locations near supplies of our primary raw material scrap steel

     experienced management team and unique corporate culture

     our senior management team is highly experienced and has a proven track
record in the steel industry including pioneering the development of thinslab
flatrolled technology their objectives are closely aligned with our
stockholders through meaningful stock ownership positions and performancebased
compensation programs our corporate culture is also unique for the steel
industry we emphasize decentralized decisionmaking and have established
incentive compensation programs specifically designed to reward employee teams
for their efforts towards enhancing productivity improving profitability and
controlling costs

     diversified product mix

     our current products include hotrolled and coldrolled steel products
galvanized sheet products light gauge steel products structural steel and
rails and joists and deck materials we have broadened our offering of painted
and coated products with the commencement of production at our recently
completed coil coating facility and at our recently acquired galvanizing
facility and we have entered the merchant bar or mbq market with an array of
angles flats rounds reinforcing bar and other shapes as well as various
special bar quality or sbq market as our bar products division becomes fully
operational this diversified mix of products should enable us to access a
broader range of enduser markets serve a broader customer base and mitigate
our exposure to cyclical downturns in commodity grade flatrolled products or in
any one product or enduser market

     strategic geographic locations

     the strategic locations of our facilities near sources of scrap materials
and our customer base allow us to realize significant pricing advantages due to
freight savings for inbound scrap as well as for outbound steel products
destined for our customers our minimills are located in the upper midwest a
region which we believe accounts for a majority of the total scrap produced in
the united states our new jeffersonville indiana galvanizing facility on the
ohio river will also provide us with an expanded geographic reach to southern
markets

     business strategy

     expand product offerings

     the completion of our structural and rail division and the commencement of
production at that facility the completion of our flat roll division coating
facility and the expansion of production of coated products at that facility as
well as our recent acquisitions of the pittsboro indiana bar mill and the
jeffersonville indiana galvanizing facility are important steps in pursuing
our strategy of product line expansion the structural and rail division is
strategically located to serve the upper midwest northeast and canadian
markets which we believe are attractive and underserved markets our strategy
to expand our flatrolled steel product offerings is to focus on the production
of high valueadded thinner gauge products galvanized products and various
coated products the margins on high valueadded products typically exceed those
of the commodity grade and the number of producers that make them is more
limited our pittsboro indiana bar mill is likewise strategically located to
position ourselves to costeffectively serve our product markets we will
continue to seek additional opportunities to further expand our range of high
valueadded products through the expansion of existing facilities greenfield
projects and acquisitions of other steel manufacturers or steelmaking assets
that may become available through the continuing consolidation of the domestic
steel industry

     enter new geographic markets

     we may seek to enter new steel markets in strategic geographic locations
such as the southeastern or western united states that offer attractive growth
opportunities due to the ongoing restructuring of the domestic steel industry
we believe there are attractive opportunities to grow our business
geographically either through acquisitions of existing assets or through
strategic partnerships and alliances we may also consider growth opportunities
through greenfield projects

                                       6

     continue to maintain low production costs

     we are focused on continuing to maintain one of the lowest operating cost
structures in the north american steel industry based upon operating cost per
ton we will continue to optimize the use of our equipment enhance our
productivity and explore new technologies to further improve our unit cost of
production at each of our facilities

     foster entrepreneurial culture

     we intend to continue to foster our entrepreneurial corporate culture and
emphasize decentralized decisionmaking while rewarding teamwork innovation
and operating efficiency we will also continue to focus on maintaining the
effectiveness of our incentive bonusbased plans that are designed to enhance
overall productivity and align the interests of our management and employees
with our stockholders

     flat roll division

     flatroll minimill

     our butler flatroll steel minimill manufactures hotrolled coldrolled
and coated steel products it currently has an annual capacity of 22 million
tons although during 2003 we actually produced approximately 24 million tons
we commenced construction of our flatroll minimill in october 1994 and began
production of commercial quality steel in january 1996 with an initial annual
capacity of 14 million tons at the end of 1997 we completed construction of a
cold finishing mill contiguous to the hot mill with an annual capacity of 10
million tons in july 1998 we completed construction installation and startup
of a second twinshell melting furnace battery thinslab caster tunnel furnace
and coiler thus increasing our minimills annual production capacity to its
current level of 22 million tons this additional production capacity of
hotrolled steel also enables us to take full advantage of the 10 million ton
rolling and finishing capacity of our cold mill our products are characterized
by high quality surface characteristics precise tolerances and light gauge in
addition our minimill was one of the first us flatroll minimills to
achieve iso 9002 and qs 9000 certifications we believe that these
certifications have enabled us to serve a broader range of customers and
endusers which historically have been almost exclusively served by integrated
steel producers

     the hot mill

     our hot mills electric arc furnace melting process begins with the
charging of a furnace vessel with scrap steel carbon and lime or with a
combination of scrap and a scrap substitute or alternative iron product the
furnace vessels top is swung into place electrodes are lowered into the
furnace vessel through holes in the top of the furnace and electricity is
applied to melt the scrap the hot briquetted iron that our iron dynamics
subsidiary began to produce during 2003 or the liquid pig iron that we hope to
begin producing during 2004 are examples of scrap substitutes that would be
introduced directly into the melt mix at this stage

     we have two fuchs twinshell electric arc melting furnaces designed to
substantially reduce both poweroff time and taptotap time the length of time
between successive melting cycles or heats when melting is being done in one
vessel we can tap the other vessel and refill it with scrap and steel scrap
substitute to make it ready for the next melt this results in more heats and
greater productivity per shift an additional advantage of our twinshell design
is that if there is a maintenance problem requiring work on one vessel melting
can proceed in the other vessel without interruption

     after exiting the furnaces the liquid steel is transported in a ladle by
overhead crane to an area commonly known as the ladle metallurgy station at
each metallurgy station the steel is kept in a molten state while metallurgical
testing refining alloying and desulfurizing takes place we have three
separate ladle metallurgy stations consisting of three furnaces and two
desulfurization stations having a separate metallurgy station apart from the
furnaces allows us to maximize the time that the furnaces can be used for
melting scrap

     the liquid steel is then transported to one of our two continuous thinslab
casters where it is emptied into a tundish or reservoir this reservoir
controls the flow of the liquid steel into a watercooled copperlined mold from
which it then exits as an externally solid slab our casters were built by sms
schloemannsiemag ag we have also designed a special nozzle which transfers
the liquid steel from the reservoir into the mold that results in increased
productivity and product quality the slab from the continuous caster is less
than two inches thick and proceeds directly into one of our two tunnel furnaces
the tunnel furnaces maintain and equalize the slabs temperature the slab
leaves the tunnel furnace and is descaled to remove surface scale prior to its
rolling

     in the hotrolling operation the slab is progressively reduced in
thickness our hotrolling mill consists of a sevenstand rolling mill built by
sms schloemannsiemag ag the mill is equipped with the latest electronic and
hydraulic controls to control such things as gauge shape profile and exit
speeds of the steel strip as it moves along the runout table to help prevent
thinner steel strip from cobbling the seventh rolling stand which we added
allows us to further roll our sheet steel to even thinner gauges down to 10
mm with excellent surface quality and enables us to access markets previously
available only to more costly cold finished material

     after exiting the hotrolling mill the rolled sheet steel is cooled and
wound into coils the coil form allows the strip to be easily handled and
transported we sell a portion of our hot band coil production directly to
endusers or to intermediate steel processors or service centers where they may
be pickled coldrolled annealed tempered or galvanized by those customers to
an ever increasing extent the rest of our hot band coil production is directed
to our cold mill where we add value to this product through our own pickling
coldrolling annealing tempering or galvanizing processes including the
additional coating capacity provided by our recently completed paint line we
also now supply our new jeffersonville indiana galvanizing facility with
coldrolled material

     throughout the hotrolling process laser optical measuring equipment and
multiple xray devices measure all strip dimensions allowing adjustments to
occur continuously and providing feedback information to the mill process
controls and computers the entire production process is monitored and
controlled by both business and process computers production schedules are
created based on order input information and transmitted to the mill computers
by the plant business system as the material is processed operating and
quality data are gathered and stored for analysis of operating performance and
for documentation of product parameters to the customer the system then
coordinates and monitors the shipping process and prints all relevant paper work
for shipping when the coil leaves the plant

     the cold mill

     our cold mill is located adjacent to our hot mill and produces products
that require gauges properties or surfaces that cannot be achieved in our hot
mill coldrolled sheet is hotrolled sheet that has been further processed
through a continuous pickle line and then successively passed through a rolling
mill without reheating until the desired gauge and other physical properties
have been achieved coldrolling reduces gauge hardens the steel and when
further processed through an annealing furnace and temper mill improves
uniformity ductility and formability coldrolling can also add a variety of
finishes and textures to the surface of the steel

     our coldrolled mill process begins with hotrolled product from our
hotrolling mill entering our continuous pickle line at the entry end of the
continuous pickle line we have two reels to unwind coils and a welder to join
the coils together we unwind the coils on alternate reels and attach them end
to end by the welder creating a continuous strip through the pickle tanks the
center section of the 700foot pickle line consists of a scale breakertension
leveler pickling tanks where the strip moves through a bath of hydrochloric
acid that thoroughly cleans the strip in preparation for galvanizing and rolling
operations and rinse tanks at the delivery end of the line there is a reel for
recoiling the pickled product after recoiling each coil is stored in a central
coil storage area the design of the continuous pickle line allows for the
production of a wide combination of gauges and widths on the light gauge steel
supplied by the hot mill

     from the central coil storage area we move our coils in one of three
directions we can 1 ship pickled and oiled coils directly to customers from
the continuous pickle line as finished product 2 immediately galvanize some
coils on the hotrolled galvanizing line which is then sold as finished product
or 3 process coils through our coldreversing mill

     pickled and oiled coils that are not intended for immediate shipment or
hotrolled galvanizing are processed in our cold reversing mill our cold
reversing mill was built by sms schloemannsiemag ag and is one of only two
semitandem twostand reversing coldrolling operations in the world this
configuration provides considerably higher throughput than a conventional
singlestand reversing mill yet also takes advantage of considerably lower
equipment costs than the conventional four to sixstand tandem coldrolling
mill the rolling mill is configured with multiple xray gauges hydraulic
bending systems rolling solution controls gauge controls and strip flatness
controls used to produce an extremely high level of product quality parameters
the coldrolling mill also uses a process control computer using sophisticated
mathematical models to optimize both quality and throughput

     product that exits the cold reversing mill can then be shipped as finished
product transported to our coldrolled galvanizing line or transported to our
batch annealing furnaces in the coldrolled galvanizing line coldrolled coils
are heated in an annealing furnace and coated while still hot in a pot of molten
zinc as the coil leaves the pot various coating controls ensure that the
product matches the customers requirements the coils are then shipped as
finished product the coldrolled galvanizing line and the hotrolled
galvanizing line are very similar but the coldrolled galvanizing line has a
more elaborate and larger strip heating furnace that is required to anneal
coldrolled product we designed our continuous pickle line and the two
galvanizing lines concurrently and procured the equipment from the same
manufacturer as a result the equipment of our three lines share a commonality
of parts and we have been able to realize a high degree of flexibility and cost
savings in the management of our spare parts

     coldrolled coils that do not require galvanizing proceed to our batch
annealing furnaces the batch annealing furnaces heat and then cool the coils in
a controlled manner to reduce the hardness of the steel that is created in the
coldrolling process the batch annealing furnaces heat the steel in a hydrogen
environment that optimizes the efficiency of the heating process and produces a
product that is superior to conventional batch annealing with regard to
cleanliness and uniform metallurgical characteristics computer models determine
and control the heating and cooling the coils based on current knowledge of heat
transfers and steel characteristics

     coils from the annealing furnaces are then temperrolled and shipped as
finished product the temper mill consists of a single stand fourhigh rolling
mill designed for relatively light reduction of the product the temper mill
introduces a small amount of hardness into the product and further enhances the
overall flatness and surface quality of the product the temper mill also has an
xray gauge to monitor strip thickness this mill was purchased concurrently
with the twostand coldrolling mill from sms schloemannsiemag ag enabling us
to realize a high degree of flexibility and cost savings with regard to
management of spare parts

     as with our hot mill our cold mill is linked by means of business and
process computers we expanded our computer systems to comprehend order entry of
the additional cold mill products and we accomplish all of our line scheduling
in the computer systems through schedules transmitted to the appropriate process
related computers we collect operating and quality data for analysis and
quality control purposes and for reporting product data to customers

     new onsite coating facility

     our new 25 million onsite paint line expansion located immediately
adjacent to our existing cold mill building was completed during 2003 and has
an estimated coating capacity of 240000 tons per year in gauges from 010 to
070 inches and in widths ranging from 36 to 64 inches the paint line receives
material directly from our other processing lines and is capable of painting hot
rolled galvanized coil cold rolled coil and cold rolled galvanized coil the
line incorporates stateoftheart coil coating equipment with quick color
change capability and online color matching inline tension leveling direct
heat clean air catenary ovens and a thermal recuperative oxidizer

     we believe that we are the only mill in north america with an onsite paint
line which should not only enable us to realize substantial savings in
overhead maintenance engineering sales and marketing capital cost and
infrastructure but will eliminate the typical cost of transfer freight
approximately 1015 per ton that a customer must otherwise pay to transport
coils to other remote coating facilities these advantages will further enable
us to continue to be a low cost supplier of coated products the addition of our
new paint line further expands our high margin value added product offerings

     new galvanizing facility

     our new jeffersonville indiana cold rolled galvanizing facility which we
purchased in march 2003 from galvpro ii llc for 175 million plus up to an
additional 15 million based on an earnout formula is located within the
clark maritime center on the ohio river the galvanizing line has an estimated
capacity of between 300000 and 350000 tons per year and is capable of coating
cold rolled steel in gauges from 008 to 045 inches and in widths between 24
and 60 inches this gauge range is lighter than that available from our butler
facility and therefore creates a further expansion of our value added product
offerings particularly in the light gauge building products arena

     the galvanizing line was built in 1999 has been well maintained and is
almost identical to the cold rolled galvanizing line at our butler mill this
familiarity helped us to facilitate a rapid startup in july 2003 this facility
enables us to continue to serve existing cold rolled galvanized customers whose
needs we might have otherwise been unable to meet the ohio river location of
this facility also creates opportunities for market expansion into other
geographic regions our butler cold mill provides the new jeffersonville
facility with cold rolled material

     structural and rail division

     structural steel and rail minimill

     we began construction of our new structural steel and rail minimill in
columbia city indiana in may 2001 completed plant construction in april 2002
and commenced commercial structural steel operations during the third quarter of
2002 our minimill is designed to have an annual production capacity of up to
13 million tons of structural steel beams pilings and other steel components
for the construction transportation and industrial machinery markets as well
as standard and premium grade rails for the railroad industry through regular
product introductions and continued production rampup of structural steel
products we were able to begin to offer a broad array of wide flange beams and
hpiling structural steel products during 2003 and during 2003 we were also
able to commission most of the rest of our structural steel product line except
for 6 inch and 36 inch beams which we hope to commission during the first
quarter of 2004 in addition we performed casting trials for the production of
standard rail products during the first quarter of 2003 and since that time
have successfully run product through the breakdown mill tandem mill cooling
bed and straightener we anticipate having finished rail product during the
second quarter of 2004 which we will provide to the railroad companies to be
tested and monitored for product evaluation this evaluation process may take
between six and nine months

     mill operation

     our structural steel and rail minimill melts scrap and scrap substitutes
in an electric arc furnace much the same way as in our flatroll minimill we
use a single shell furnace but have purchased and installed a second furnace
which provides us with backup melting capability in case of a furnace breakdown
or during one of our periodic maintenance outages at present our operating
permit only enables us to use one furnace at a time while we plan to use 100
scrap as the primary raw material the type of scrap required for the production
of structural steel and rail products is generally of a cheaper and less
expensive grade than that required for the production of flatrolled steel the
furnace was built by sms demag ag and includes features that permit us to employ
more thermally efficient melting practices the furnace features a removable
shell that enables us to do offline repair and refractory relining comes
equipped with a unique quickchange roof configuration and also features a fast
tap hole tube change configuration that shortens the time required for periodic
replacement

                                       10
page

     from the furnace the molten metal is transported to a separate ladle
metallurgy furnace where as in the flatroll minimill we adjust the mix for
temperature and chemistry we then take the liquid steel to a continuous caster
where unlike our butler minimill that produces a single strand of flat stock
our structural steel caster casts three strands expandable to four of blooms
and beam blanks the caster utilizes a curved mold that produces five sizes of
materialone bloom which is rectangular shaped and four beam blanks which
are dog bone shaped in varying lengths of 17 to 48 feet the caster design
accommodates a quickchange tundish nozzle system designed to optimize the
continuous casting process and to achieve a low operational cost per ton the
tundish bottoms are also designed to change from a bloom opening to any of four
beam blank sizes to allow greater flexibility in product choice the caster was
built by sms concast

     after exiting the mold the multiple strands continue through a series of
sprays and roller supports to precisely cool and contain the cast shapes
straightener rolls then unbend the curved strands onto a horizontal passline
where they are cut to length by automatic torches we then weigh the cast pieces
and transport them either directly through a reheat furnace built by ac
leadbetter to a hotrolling mill or into a storage area for rolling at a later
time in the hotrolling mill the product passes through a breakdown stand
where it is rolled into either a structural steel product or a rail product
depending on the rollconfiguration and number of passes the product is then
transferred to a 3stand tandem mill which consists of a universal rougher an
edger and a universal finisher the hotrolling mill is an advanced fourstand
all reversing mill built by sms demag ag the minimill is capable of producing
wide flange beams from 6 x 4 to 36 x 12 standard beams piling sections
mshape sections sheet piling channels car building shapes bulb angles and
zees and rail sections

     downstream of the hotrolling mill a hot saw cuts the structural steel to
a maximum 246foot length before it enters a cooling bed after cooling the
structural steel product is straightened on a roller straightener and cut to
length as required by a particular order the product is then piled and bundled
and shipped as finished product

     for the production of rail products we have fitted our caster with new
molds and segments to cast the new 13 x 10 blooms required for rail
production we have also added electro magnetic stirring within the caster to
improve surface quality and reduce internal cracking the reheat furnace which
heats the blooms to the proper rolling temperature is also fitted with
automation changes for the charging and discharging machines we also operate
additional descaling equipment prior to the rolling process as well as a rail
stamper and manipulator both vertical and horizontal straighteners are used to
produce a rail that is true along all axes after straightening the rail
product is tested cut to length and drilled in our testing center we provide
ultrasonic testing for the detection of internal defects an eddy current
machine to spot surface cracks a profile gauge for dimensional accuracy and a
straightnesswaviness measurement machine we are also in the process of
installing additional cooling and handling equipment to manufacture highly
desirable 320foot rail lengths which no one else produces in or imports into
the us or canadian rail markets

     iron dynamics steel scrap substitute facility

     since 1997 iron dynamics has tried to develop and commercialize a
pioneering process of producing a virgin form of iron that might serve as a
lower cost substitute for a portion of the metallic raw material mix that goes
into our electric arc furnaces to be melted into new steel historically the
price of steel scrap as a commodity has tended to be volatile rising and
falling with supply and demand and not always in lock step with or in proportion
to the market price of new steel more recently and increasingly so during the
last half of 2003 and thus far during 2004 with no immediate prospects for
prices to abate scrap costs have accelerated to historic highs threatening one
of the principal elements of the minimills traditional lower cost
structurethe cost of its metallic raw material therefore having a lower cost
alternative source of virgin iron for a portion of a minimills melt mix if
realizable would partially buffer the effects of high scrap prices and scrap
price volatility with the growing proportion of electric furnace steelmaking
both worldwide and domestically we believe that the benefits of developing a
costeffective alternate iron source to augment scrap our primary raw material
makes good economic sense in the long run

     direct reduced iron is a metallic product made from iron ore or iron ore
fines that have been treated in a direct reduction furnace such as a rotary
hearth furnace with either natural gas or coal to reduce the iron oxide to
metallic iron the method selected by iron dynamics is one that uses coal as the
reducing agent the direct reduced iron or dri is then compacted by
briquetters to form hot briquetted iron or hbi which is stable and can be
immediately used in our melting furnaces or stockpiled for later use liquid pig
iron the ultimate end product intended to be produced by iron dynamics is a
pure metal product produced by smelting the direct reduced iron in a submerged
arc furnace our iron dynamics facility was designed and built for the
production of direct reduced iron and its conversion into liquid pig iron we
planned to use all of iron dynamics liquid pig iron in our flat roll divisions
steelmaking operations at butler

                                       11

     the plant commenced initial startup in august 1999 during this
preliminary startup however we encountered a number of equipment and design
deficiencies which required iron dynamics to undertake some costly and
timeconsuming redesign reengineering and equipment replacement work and to
operate this new facility at greatly reduced output levels a design and
retrofit program began in late 1999 and continued throughout 2000 in july 2000
iron dynamics suspended operations to effect certain preplanned repairs
including the installation of a new submerged arc furnace and a number of
additional capital projects including the installation of two hot briquetters
a new offgas system for the submerged arc furnace a sludge reclamation system
and a hot pan conveyance system in march 2001 iron dynamics restarted the
facility however in july 2001 we suspended operations because of higher than
expected startup and process refinement costs then high prevailing energy
costs low production quantities and historically low steel scrap pricing that
existed at that time these factors during that period made the cost of
producing and using iron dynamics scrap substitute product at our flatroll
minimill higher than the cost of purchasing and using steel scrap

     we continued to make refinements to our systems and processes
notwithstanding the shutdown and began experimental production trials again
during the fourth quarter of 2002 after an evaluation of these production
trials we concluded that improved production technology coupled with our
ability to recycle waste materials as part of our raw material mix and the then
increasingly higher price of scrap made the restart and operation of this
production facility feasible during 2003 we spent approximately 13 million to
further modify and refine the process including the installation of three
briquetting machines which enable us to stockpile iron briquettes or hot
briquetted iron hbi after reduction in the rotary hearth furnace for use
directly as an alternate metallic feed stock in our flat roll divisions
steelmaking operations in connection with the liquid pig iron conversion
process the briquettes would first be liquefied and the hot liquid pig iron
would then be transferred in ladles to the flatroll mills meltshop and
combined with scrap steel in the mills electric arc furnaces during february
2003 we announced a restart of ironmaking operations at iron dynamics and
during december 2003 we produced 15100 tonnes of hbi we anticipate ramping up
production of hbi to approximately 3035000 tons per month by the end of the
second quarter of 2004 all of which we intend to use at our flat roll division
we have not yet restarted the smelting end of the iron dynamics process the
conversion of hbi into liquid pig iron but we anticipate restarting the
submerged arc furnace by the end of the first quarter or the beginning of the
second quarter of 2004

     as of december 31 2003 our equity investment in the iron dynamics project
was 185 million

     bar products division

     pittsboro indiana bar mill

     we purchased our pittsboro indiana bar minimill from qualitech steel sbq
llc in september 2002 and we are in the final phase of a 75 to 80 million
program to upgrade and retrofit the mill to produce a broad array of merchant
quality or mbq bars and shapes and reinforcing bar products as well as
special bar quality or sbq products the mill was originally constructed in
1997 as an sbq mill and consists generally of a 100 ton single shell ac melting
furnace by sms demag a three strand sms demag continuous caster capable of
casting both a 7 x 7 billet and a 14 x 10 bloom a reheat furnace and a
rolling mill consisting of a pomini roughing mill and intermediate mill and
kocks reducing and sizing blocks used in the production of sbq rounds the
meltshop is also equipped with a separate ladle metallurgy facility or lmf
where metallurgical testing refining alloying and desulfurizing takes place
and a vacuum tank degasser which is used to degas steel to produce ultra low
carbon and ultra high purity products

     we have added an eight stand finishing mill together with ancillary
equipment such as abrasive saws shears a straightener and magnetic stacking
equipment which will enable us to produce merchant bars and shapes as well as
reinforcing bar products

     we began melting and casting operations in middecember and began shipping
some limited products by yearend 2003 we are currently producing larger sizes
mbq and sbq bars and expect the arrival and installation of equipment during the
first quarter of 2004 which will enable us during the second quarter to begin
production of the smaller rounds angles flats channels and similar products
we expect that the pittsboro facility will have a capacity of approximately
500000 to 600000 tons per year

     new millennium facility

     in the first quarter of 2003 we increased our ownership percentage in our
consolidated new millennium building systems subsidiary from our preexisting
466 ownership interest to 100 through our acquisition of the 466 interest
in new millennium previously held by new process steel corporation a privately
held houston texas steel processor and our purchase of the remaining 68 stake
owned by some of new millenniums managers after completion of the final
purchases and including our original investment we have invested approximately
14 million in our new millennium subsidiary

     new millennium produces steel building components for the construction
industry including joists girders trusses and steel roof and floor decking
these products are sold primarily in the upper midwest nonresidential building
components market our flat roll division supplies a majority of the hotrolled
steel utilized in new millenniums manufacturing operations

     products and customers

     flat roll division

     products our butler minimill produces hotrolled products that include a
variety of high quality mild and medium carbon and high strength low alloy
hotrolled bands in 40 inch to 62 inch widths and in thicknesses from 500 inch
down to 080 inch we also produce an array of lighter gauge hotrolled
products ranging in thickness from 080 inch and thinner including high
strength low alloy 80000 minimum yield and medium carbon steels made possible
by the addition of our seventh hotrolling stand these products are suitable
for automobile truck trailer and recreational vehicle parts and components
mechanical and structural steel tubing gas and fluid transmission piping metal
building systems rail cars ships barges and other marine equipment
agricultural equipment and farm implements lawn garden and recreation
equipment industrial machinery and shipping containers

     we believe that our basic production hot band material has shape
characteristics that exceed those of the other thinslab flatroll minimills
and compares favorably with those of the integrated mills in addition as a
result of our lighter gauge hotrolling capabilities we are now able to produce
hotrolled hotdipped galvanized and galvannealed steel products these products
are capable of replacing products that have traditionally only been available as
more costly coldrolled galvanized or coldrolled galvannealed steel during
2002 and 2003 we produced 849000 tons and 11 million tons of these lighter
gauge hotrolled products respectively our new galvanizing facility will also
further enable us to add to our mix of higher margin value added products
through our ability to coat additional material that would otherwise not be
coated due to the galvanizing capacity limitations at our butler mill during
2003 approximately 60 of our flatroll shipments consisted of valueadded
products

     in our cold mill we also produce hotrolled pickled and oiled hotrolled
hot dipped galvanized hotrolled galvannealed coldrolled hot dipped
galvanized coldrolled galvannealed and fully processed coldrolled sheet our
new paint line will paint hot rolled galvanized coil cold rolled coil and cold
rolled galvanized coil in gauges from 010 to 070 inches and widths ranging
from 36 inches to 64 inches this material will typically be used in
transportation products building products such as raised garage door panels
heating and cooling products appliances furniture and lighting equipment

     during 2003 we sold our products to approximately 190 customers in 2003
our largest customers were heidtman steel new process steel and straightline
which in the aggregate accounted for approximately 23 of our total net sales
heidtman accounted individually for approximately 18 17 and 13 of our net
sales in 2001 2002 and 2003 respectively

     steel processors and service centers typically act as intermediaries
between primary steel producers such as us and the many enduser manufacturers
that require further processing of hot bands the additional processing
performed by the intermediate steel processors and service centers include
pickling galvanizing cutting to length slitting to size leveling blanking
shape correcting edge rolling shearing and stamping notwithstanding the
completion of our cold mill and our increased utilization in our own cold
finishing facility for a considerable portion of our hot band production we
expect that our intermediate steel processor and service center customers will
remain an integral part of our customer base our sales outside the continental
united states accounted for approximately 7 of our total net sales in 2003

     we have gradually been ramping up production of different structural
products in various sizes and foot weights since we commenced initial
production in july 2002 during february 2004 we rolled approximately 55000
tons and shipped approximately 67000 tons of product we have also initiated
certain value added services for the midwestern fabricator market including
exact length and exact piece count capabilities

     customers the principal customers for our structural steel products are
steel service centers steel fabricators and various manufacturers service
centers though not the ultimate enduser provide valuable mill distribution
functions to the fabricators and manufacturers including small quantity sales
repackaging cutting preliminary processing and warehousing a majority of our
structural steel products are sold to service centers

     the marketplace for steel rails in the united states and canada is
relatively small approximately 800000 tons in 2002 and is also specialized
with only approximately six class 1 railroad purchasers burlington
northernsanta fe union pacific canadian pacific railway norfolk southern
csx transportation and canadian national railway these purchasers account for
approximately 600000 tons of annual production rail contractors transit
districts and shortline railroads purchase the rest of the rail products

     we intend to produce rail in standard and premium or headhardened grades
in a range of weights from 115 lbs per yard to 141 lbs per yard in lengths
from the traditional 80 feet up to 240 feet initially and ultimately to 320
feet we also intend to weld these 240320 foot rails into 1600 foot strings
for delivery to the installation site such long strings offer substantial
savings both in terms of initial capital cost and through reduced maintenance
in contrast current production of rail in the united states and available
imported rail is limited to 80foot lengths as a result of existing plant
layout restrictions and the physical limitations of ocean freight the more
welded joints there are in a mile of track the greater the maintenance cost to
the railroad due to excessive wear and fatigue cracking at the welds

     bar products division

     products we expect to be able to produce a broad line of merchant bar
products such as angles flats channels ts and rounds as well as rebar
products in sizes from 3 to 18 we also plan to produce various sbq products

     merchant bar products are used in a wide variety of applications including
automotive fasteners conveyor assemblies rack systems transmission towers
gratings safety walkways stair railings farm and lawn and garden equipment
light steel fabrication machinery ornamental iron projects and construction
equipment sbq alloyed steel bars are predominantly used in automotive parts
such as crankshafts and drive shafts aerospace products and in various types
of machinery construction and transportation equipment

     rebar is used principally for strengthening concrete approximately half of
rebar consumption is in construction projects involving the private sector
including commercial and industrial buildings apartments and hotels utility
construction agricultural projects and various repair and maintenance
applications the other half of rebar consumption is accounted for by public
works projects such as highway and street construction public buildings
bridges municipal water and sewer treatment facilities and similar projects

                                       14

     customers merchant bar products are generally sold to fabricators steel
service centers and original equipment manufacturers rebar is generally sold to
fabricators and manufacturers who cut bend shape and fabricate the steel to
meet engineering architectural and endproduct specifications sbq products are
principally consumed by fabricators intermediate processors and steel service
centers

competition

     flat roll division

     our hotrolled products compete with many north american integrated
hotrolled coil producers such as us steels plants near detroit michigan
granite city illinois gary indiana dravosburg pennsylvania and fairfield
alabama ispat inland incs plant in east chicago indiana and ak steel
corporations plant in middletown ohio we also compete with international
steel group or isg which has purchased out of bankruptcy ltv steel
corporations former steelmaking facilities at cleveland ohio and indiana
harbor indiana acme steels rolling facility in chicago and the former
bethlehem steel plants in burns harbor indiana and sparrows point maryland
we also compete with companies that convert steel slabs into sheet steel such
as duferco steel in farrell pennsylvania as a result of the integrated mills
lesser dependence on steel scrap as a raw material than minimills and as a
result of the consolidations that have occurred over the past year in the us
steel industry including the emergence of relaxed union work rules and lower
capital structures many of these integrated mills are beginning to have cost
structures closer to those of the minimills rendering them more competitive
than traditionally so

     our hotrolled products also compete with the products of a number of
hotrolled minimills such as nucor corporations 16 million ton capacity
plant in crawfordsville indiana its 17 million ton capacity plant in hickman
arkansas and its 20 million ton capacity plant in berkeley south carolina
gallatin steel companys 12 million ton capacity plant in ghent kentucky and
north star bhp steel llcs 12 million ton capacity plant in delta ohio

     with the exception of gallatin steel we compete with these same producers
for the sale of our coldrolled and coated products we also compete with a
number of companies such as worthington steel of columbus ohio winner steel
of youngstown ohio and metaltech of pittsburgh pennsylvania which buy their
hotrolled or coldrolled bands from other producers and then convert them into
products that are competitive with ours

     structural and rail division

     sales of structural steel products are sensitive to the level of
construction activity which is in turn affected by such cyclical factors as
general economic conditions interest rates inflation consumer spending and
employment

     our structural steel products compete with a sizable number of electric arc
furnace structural steelmakers some of which have cost structures and flexible
management cultures similar to our own notable competitors include nucor steel
in berkeley south carolina nucoryamato steel in blytheville arkansas and
txichaparral steel in midlothian texas and petersburg virginia there are
also a number of smaller competitors including ameristeel in cartersville
georgia and bayou steel in laplace louisiana the nucor minimills and the
txichaparral minimills accounted for approximately 89 of the tons produced in
north america in 2001 we also believe however that both geography and product
choice will play significant roles there are currently no other structural
mills located in the midwest one of the largest structural steel consuming
regions in the united states and we believe we will be able to provide
freightsaving and customer service benefits to end users service centers and
fabricators located in the region we also believe that most of canadas
structural steel consumption is located in canadas eastern provinces closer to
us than to either of our two largest competitors moreover we intend to provide
a broad product mix focusing on the midrange and larger section served only by
nucoryamato steel and txichaparral from locations more remote than our
minimill

     at present the rail market is principally served by two producers rocky
mountain steel a division of oregon steel mills inc in pueblo colorado and
pennsylvania steel technologies formerly a subsidiary of bethlehem steel
corporation now isg in steelton pennsylvania each of these producers has the
capability to produce either standard or premium rail although neither is
equipped to produce rail in 240foot or 320foot lengths as we will do our rail
products will also compete with similar products from a number of high quality
integrated and electric furnace steel producers in europe and asia including
british steel voestalpine schienen nippon steel and nkk

     bar products division

     we anticipate that our major competitors for merchant bar shapes and
reinforcing bar product sales generally within a 500 mile radius of pittsboro

     sources availability and cost of scrap and scrap substitute

     our principal raw material is scrap metal derived from among other sources
home scrap generated internally at steel mills themselves industrial scrap
generated by excess steel trimmed or produced during manufacturing and
obsolete scrap such as railroad cars and railroad track materials
agricultural machinery and demolition scrap from obsolete structures containers
and machines

     scrap

     scrap is the single most important raw material used in our minimill
steelmaking process traditionally comprising approximately 8085 of the
metallic melt mix in electric arc furnace steelmaking in contrast to integrated
mill steelmaking where the proportion of scrap has traditionally been
approximately 20 depending upon the carbon content of scrap substitute
material that may be available from time to time and the relative cost of such
material the percentage of scrap used in our steelmaking operations could be
reduced to the range of 60 or less

     as it relates to final product quality electric arc furnace steel
producers can normally only tolerate a maximum 2 level of residual materials
such as nonferrous metallic contamination from copper nickel tin chromium
and molybdenum which once having been dissolved into steel cannot be refined
out in order for the scrap melt to provide this level of quality under present
circumstances the mill must use approximately 60 of low residual scrap or an
equivalent material such low residual scrap is generally more expensive and
takes the form of no 1 dealer bundles no 1 factory bundles busheling and
clips such low residual scrap is generally more expensive the balance of the
melt mix can then consist of various grades of higher residual and thus less
expensive scrap which can be blended with low residual scrap to keep within
impurity tolerances

     many variables can impact scrap prices the most critical of which until
recently was the level of us steel production the us has generally been a
net scrap exporter generally as domestic steel demand increased so did scrap
demand and resulting scrap prices the reverse was also normally but not always
true with scrap prices following steel prices downward where supply exceeded
demand during late 2000 the flood of imported steel much of it unfairly
traded resulted in sharply reduced new steel production with corresponding
decreases in the need for and thus the price of scrap this corresponding
decrease in the price of scrap mitigated somewhat the impact of sharply
declining prices for new steel products during 2000 and 2001 and enabled us to
maintain some modest profit margins despite the severe market dislocation the
precipitous decline in scrap prices in 1999 and 2000 however caused dealers to
retain their inventories and to withhold them from sale thus causing some
shortterm supply shortages even in the face of a supplydemand inversion at the
consumer levels on the other hand starting during the latter part of 2002 and
continuing through 2003 and into 2004 the price of scrap has risen sharply
upward largely as a result of foreign scrap demand particularly from china a
weak us dollar that makes us scrap exports more attractive and relatively
static if not limited scrap availability in the us due to a weak economy and
the shrinking domestic manufacturing base scrap exports from the us were
approximately 12 million metric tons in 2003 up 35 from 89 million tons in
2002 these factors have driven scrap prices to their highest levels in decades
in september 2003 the price of no 1 factory bundles a key scrap commodity
was approximately 166 per ton the same commodity cost 280 per ton in february
and 310 in early march 2004

                                       16

     we believe that the demand for low residual scrap will continue to rise
more rapidly than the supply in the coming years especially with the increased
number of electric arc furnace minimills both here and abroad that have been
built or commenced operations in recent years and especially due to foreign
scrap demand as a result in order to maintain an available supply of scrap at
competitive market prices we seek to maintain multiple strong and dependable
sources through which to competitively purchase scrap of all grades including
low residual scrap and have also been attempting to develop our own captive
scrap substitutes supply

     since our inception we were able to ensure a stable scrap supply for our
flat roll and structural and rail divisions through a scrap supply agreement
with omnisource corporation one of the largest suppliers of scrap in the
nation however we have determined that in the current scrap environment we
would be better off with multiple available sources of supply including the
development of our own scrap purchasing capability and with the flexibility to
develop new relationships and supply agreements with third parties and certain
scrap generators accordingly we and omnisource have amicably terminated our
scrap supply agreement effective march 31 2004 we intend however to
continue purchasing scrap from omnisource as one of our major suppliers

         scrap substitutes

     direct reduced iron hot briquetted iron and pig iron can substitute for a
limited portion of the steel scrap used in electric furnace minimill steel
production historically we have used a relatively small percentage of scrap
substitutes in our melt mix historically we have used approximately 15 by
weight of scrap substitutes in our melt mix mainly solid and generally imported
pig iron during 2003 we consumed approximately 364000 tons of scrap
substitutes of the 34 million tons of metallics that we melted in our electric
arc furnaces we also bought minimal quantities of direct reduced iron and hot
briquetted iron all of these scrap substitute purchases were made on the spot
market at prevailing market prices

     we anticipate that we will utilize all of iron dynamics scrap substitute
product output whether hbi or liquid pig iron which at full production we
estimate to be approximately 360000 tonnes of liquid pig iron per year

     our industry

     overview

     the us steel industry has historically been and continues to be highly
cyclical in nature influenced by a combination of factors including periods of
economic growth or recession strength or weakness of the us dollar worldwide
production capacity worldwide steel demand and levels of steel imports the
steel industry has also been affected by various companyspecific factors such
as a companys ability or inability to adapt to and deal with technological
change plant inefficiency and high labor costs the us is a net steel
importer requiring that approximately 17 of its domestic steel consumption be
imported

     during the second half of 2000 and throughout 2001 the us steel industry
experienced a severe downward cycle largely as a result of increased imports of
steel at depressed prices the effect of a strong dollar weak economic
conditions and excess global steel production capacity on the other hand
during the first half of 2002 domestic flatrolled steel prices increased
dramatically from historical cyclical lows in 2001 this increase resulted from
a number of factors including 1 a temporary reduction in domestic steel
production capacity as a result of certain bankruptcies and shutdowns of other
us steel producers 2 a reduction in imports driven in part by certain
favorable rulings and executive actions with respect to tariffs and quotas on
foreign steel and 3 a brief strengthening of the overall us economy and the
need for endusers of steel products to replenish their depleted inventories
the cycle began to turn downward again toward the end of 2002 and into early
2003 however largely as a result of softening product demand brought about by
a still weak economy and war concerns the shortness of the previous up cycle
poor cost controls and high fixed costs for many steel producers an absence of
any supply or pricing discipline by individual producers and the strength of
the us dollar that brought exports streaming into the country created the
conditions for more than 30 bankruptcies among us steel producers mainly
integrated producers between 2001 and 2003

     these economic dislocations rationalization of production capacity and
supply due to steel industry consolidation a weakened us dollar high ocean
freight rates and strong foreign mainly chinese and asian steel demand and
scrap demand combined during 2003 to substantially reduce steel imports into
the us thus constraining the supply of new steel for domestic consumption
moreover by rendering exports of steel abroad more attractive this has also
acted to constrain the us supply of scrap for domestic consumption the result
has not only been a dramatic increase in us steel pricing toward the end of
2003 and into 2004 but it has also led to unprecedented increases in the cost
of steel scrap

                                       17
page

     the us steel industry experienced many changes during 2003 as a result of
consolidation in 2001 the top three us producers of flatrolled sheet had a
32 market share for 2003 the top three us steel isg and nucor had a
market share of 55 international steel group added to its acquisition of the
bankrupt steel assets of ltv steel with its acquisition of acme steels assets
and its acquisition of the assets of bethlehem steel all three of these
acquisitions resulted from the prior bankruptcies of the predecessor steel
companies similarly us steel acquired the bankrupt assets of national steel
these and similar developments caused formerly idled or inefficient production
facilities to come back into the market with substantially lower capital costs
with lower renegotiated labor costs and work rules and shorn of many previously
burdensome health care and retirement legacy costs and other liabilities the
result of this consolidation which we expect to continue is a more competitive
and more price sensitive us steel market with a narrowing of production cost
differentials between minimills and some of these integrated producers
moreover with the integrated mills lesser dependence on ever more expensive
scrap as a percentage of their metallics melt ix than the minimills the
traditional minimill cost advantage of steel scrap over integrated mill
ironmaking has also begun to invert

antidumping initiatives

     us steel producers compete with many foreign producers competition from
foreign producers is typically strong but is also substantially affected by the
relative strength of foreign economies and fluctuation in the value of the us
dollar against foreign currencies with steel imports tending to increase when
the value of the dollar is strong in relation to foreign currencies during the
1990s the situation was exacerbated by a weakening of certain economies
particularly in eastern europe asia and latin america because of the
ownership control or subsidization of some foreign steel producers by their
governments decisions by such producers with respect to their production sales
and pricing decisions are often influenced to a greater degree by political and
economic policy consideration than by prevailing market conditions realities of
the marketplace or consideration of profit or loss since 1998 when imports of
hotrolled and coldrolled products increased 43 compared to the prior year
domestic steel producers including us have been adversely affected by
illegally dumped imported steel dumping involves selling a product below cost
or for less than in the exporters home country and is a violation of us trade
laws most foreign markets are less open than the us market allowing foreign
producers to maintain higher prices in their own markets while dumping excess
production at lower and often subsidized prices into the us market a number
of steel industry antidumping initiatives or trade cases have been brought in
recent years in an attempt to stem the flow of these unlawful imports some have
been successful and some have not

     hotrolled sheet

     in september 1998 eleven us steel companies including us as well as
two labor unions filed antidumping complaints with the itc and the us
department of commerce against hotrolled steel imports from japan russia and
brazil seeking determinations that those three countries were dumping
hotrolled carbon steel in the us market at below fair market prices the
group also filed a subsidy or countervailing duty complaint against brazil

     in april 1999 the department of commerce issued a final determination that
imports of hotrolled steel from japan were dumped at margins ranging from 17
to 65 and in june 1999 the itc reached a final determination that imports of
hotrolled sheet from japan caused injury to the us steel industry as a
consequence the department of commerce issued an antidumping order against
imports from japan

     in july 1999 the department of commerce also issued suspension agreements
and final antidumping duty determinations as to imports of hotrolled sheet
from brazil and russia suspension agreements generally impose price andor
quantity restrictions on imports from the subject country for the purpose of
removing the injurious impact of the dumping or subsidies and are often
negotiated with the subject country either in lieu of the imposition of
antidumping or countervailing duties or as an alternate remedy to suspend a
previously imposed duty in february 2002 the department of commerce having
found violations of the suspension agreement by brazilian producers revoked the
agreement and reimposed dumping duties of 48 in june 2004 the department of
commerce will conduct a required sunset review regarding the countervailing
duty orders andor suspension agreements against russia japan and brazil to
decide whether in june 2005 these orders should be extended for an additional
five years or revoked

     while we and the us steel industry benefited from these rulings with
hotrolled sheet imports from these three countries which accounted for
approximately 70 of 1998s hotrolled import tonnage declining by
approximately 90 the benefit was significantly thwarted by the shifting of
imports to hotrolled sheet from countries other than japan russia and brazil
which increased significantly during 2000 therefore in november 2000 we
joined three other minimills and four integrated producers and filed
antidumping cases against imports of hotrolled sheet from 11 countries
argentina india indonesia kazakhstan the netherlands the peoples republic
of china romania south africa taiwan thailand and ukraine and
countervailing duty cases against five countries argentina india indonesia
south africa and thailand on august 17 2001 the itc made final affirmative
injury determinations on imports of hotrolled steel from argentina and south
africa and the department of commerce imposed antidumping duty orders of
4045 on hotrolled steel imported from argentina and 93 on hotrolled steel
imported from south africa on september 23 2001 the department of commerce
issued the following final dumping margins although these margins are subject
to modification from pending litigation on hotrolled steel imported from india
 2943 indonesia  48 kazakhstan  2435 the netherlands  3 china
 6491 romania  1780 taiwan  2029 thailand  420 and ukraine 
90 in addition the department of commerce issued the following final
countervailing duties on hotrolled steel imported from the following countries
india  832 indonesia  10 south africa  63 and thailand  24 the
itc made final affirmative injury determinations on these remaining cases in
november 2001 and the department of commerce imposed antidumping duty orders
these orders are supposed to remain in effect for at least five years although
they are subject to annual administrative review and may be shortened at the
end of five years the itc will conduct a sunset review to the extent that any
of the foregoing duty orders remain in effect of the foregoing final orders by
the itc only one involving the netherlands was appealed to the court of
international trade and the itc determination was recently upheld

     in june 2002 the us granted market economy status to russia which may
enable russia to more effectively defend itself against future dumping actions
on the basis of russian production costs rather than on the basis of comparison
with surrogate country production costs

     coldrolled sheet

     in june 1999 we together with other domestic producers and the united
steel workers of america also filed a complaint with the itc and the department
of commerce seeking a determination that coldrolled steel products from
argentina brazil china indonesia japan slovakia south africa taiwan
thailand turkey and venezuela were being dumped in the us market at below
fair market prices on july 19 1999 the itc made unanimous affirmative
preliminary determinations of a reasonable indication of injury by reason of
such imports the department of commerce announced preliminary dumping
determinations which required the posting of dumping duties in november and
december of 1999 in january 2000 the department of commerce issued a
determination that imports of coldrolled steel from six of the countries were
dumped at margins ranging from 17 to 81 we were ultimately not successful in
these coldrolled cases however and on march 3 2000 and thereafter the itc
made negative final injury determinations against these eleven countries ruling
that the industry was not being injured by these imports these negative
outcomes resulted in a resurgence of dumped coldrolled imports in the second
half of 2000 and depressed coldrolled prices caused by these unfair practices
as a consequence of the approximate 50 increase in imports of coldrolled sheet
steel from 20 countries during the first half of 2001 at prices averaging 50
or more below their 1998 prices that the department of commerce had determined
at that time to have been dumped we and other steel manufacturers brought
antidumping petitions on september 28 2001 against imports from these 20
countries and countervailing duty petitions against five countries these
countries including argentina australia belgium brazil china france
germany india japan south korea the netherlands new zealand russia south
africa spain sweden taiwan thailand turkey and venezuela represented
nearly 80 of the imported coldrolled sheet in a preliminary ruling in
november 2001 the itc found in favor of the petitioners and between march and
may 2002 the us department of commerce found that these imports had been sold
in the united states at less than fair value and that those from brazil france
and south korea had also been subsidized accordingly the us department of
commerce issued various preliminary antidumping duty or countervailing duty
margin orders directed at most of these countries

     however on august 27 2002 the itc made a negative injury determination
on coldrolled imports from australia india japan sweden and thailand and
these determinations were upheld on appeal in february 2004 by the court of
international trade thus ending these cases on october 17 2002 the itc
determined that no material injury or threatened injury resulted from
coldrolled steel under investigation from argentina belgium brazil france
germany south korea the netherlands new zealand russia south africa spain
taiwan turkey and venezuela these negative injury determinations by the itc
had the effect of reversing the us department of commerces imposition of
antidumping and countervailing duty margins on products of these countries the
steel industry petitioners have appealed these negative injury determinations by
the itc to the court of international trade which remanded the cases to the itc
for further determination the itcs response is due march 29 2004

     structural steel and rail

     in addition to the various hot and cold flatrolled steel cases a number
of structural steel producers prosecuted antidumping cases against imports of
structural steel in july 1999 nucoryamato txichaparral and northwestern
steel and wire filed antidumping cases on imports of structural steel products
from germany japan korea and spain germany and spain were subsequently
dropped from these cases in april 2000 the department of commerce found duties
of 3265 on imports from japan and 1545 on imports from korea in june 2000
in a 60 vote the itc found injury or threat of injury to the us structural
steel industry and the department of commerce imposed antidumping duty orders
these orders can remain in effect for at least five years subject however to
annual administrative review at the end of five years the itc will conduct a
sunset review in may 2001 a coalition of us structural steel beam producers
filed antidumping petitions with the department of commerce and the itc
alleging that imports of structural steel beams from eight other countries
china germany italy luxembourg russia south africa spain and taiwan are
being sold at less than fair value and are causing or threatening to cause
material injury to the us structural steel beam industry while the department
of commerce found that these imports were being sold in the united states at
less than fair value and therefore made affirmative dumping findings the itc
on june 17 2002 determined that such imports did not materially injure or
threaten with material injury an industry in the united states as a result the
itc made final negative injury determinations in all such cases thus ending
these investigations without the imposition of duties

     there are antidumping duty and countervailing duty orders against imports
of rails from canada however there are currently no canadian steel makers
producing rails there are no antidumping duty or countervailing duty orders
outstanding against imports of rails from any other country nor are there any
current investigations

     rebar

     in july 2000 certain rebar manufacturers filed a petition with the itc
against the dumping of rebar in certain united states markets in august 2000
the itc issued a preliminary determination of injury or threatened injury
resulting in an imposition of duties by the us department of commerce ranging
from 17 to 133 on imports from eight countries these orders will remain in
effect for five years subject to sunset review as well as the normal annual
administrative review that could result in a shortening of the duty orders

     although there are a number of additional trade cases pending before the
itc involving various groups of imported steel products most rulings regarding
duties and tariffs since the march 2002 imposition by president bush of the
section 201 tariffs described in the following section have been against the
us steel industry

section 201 investigation

     on june 5 2001 president bush announced a threepart program to address
the excessive imports of steel that were depressing markets in the united
states the program involved 1 negotiations with foreign governments seeking
nearterm elimination of inefficient excess steel production capacity throughout
the world 2 negotiations with foreign governments to establish rules that
will govern steel trade in the future and eliminate subsidies and 3 an
investigation by the itc under section 201 of the trade act of 1974 to determine
whether steel is being imported into the united states in such quantities as to
be a substantial cause of serious injury to the us steel industry therefore
on june 22 2001 the bush administration requested that the itc initiate an
investigation under section 201 of the trade act of 1974 products included in
the request were in the following categories subject to exclusion of certain
products

         1 carbon and alloy flat products

         2 carbon and alloy long products

         3 carbon and alloy pipe and tube and

         4 stainless steel and alloy tool steel products

     hotrolled coldrolled and coated steel

     on october 22 2001 in the first step of the threestep section 201
process the itc ruled that approximately 80 of the us steel industry
suffered material injury due to imported steel products including carbon and
alloy hotrolled coldrolled coated and semifinished slab products as well
as hot rolled bars reinforcing bars and light shapes of the 33 steel products
included in the petition brought by the us trade representative and president
bush 12 products including the products we produce were affirmed for injury
by unanimous 60 votes on december 7 2001 in the second step of the process
the itc recommended tariffs of approximately 2040 as well as tariff quotas in
some cases and these recommendations were transmitted to president bush for
final action on march 5 2002 in the third and final step of the section 201
process president bush imposed a three year tariff of 30 for the first year
24 for the second year and 18 for the third year on imports of hotrolled
coldrolled and coated sheet he also imposed a tariff of 15 for the first
year 12 for the second year and 9 for the third year on imports of tubular
steel products and a tariff on imported steel slabs of 30 24 and 18 in the
first second and third years respectively on tons in excess of an annual
quota of 54 million in 2002 59 million in 2003 and 64 million in 2004 north
american free trade agreement partners of the united states principally canada
and mexico were excluded from the tariffs as were developing countries
which in the aggregate account for less than 3 of imported steel these
section 201 remedies were to be cumulative with any existing tariffs or quotas
in the antidumping cases they were also directed at products rather than the
countries that produce those products thereby providing some import relief even
if some steel products find their way to exporting countries not covered by
antidumping margin or countervailing duty orders

     the presidents decision to implement a section 201 remedy was not
appealable to us courts however foreign governments appealed to the world
trade organization or wto and the european union japan and other countries
prosecuted such appeals president bush rescinded the section 201 tariffs
however in december 2003 after the wto ruled that the tariffs violated
international law and various other nations threatened to impose retaliatory
tariffs on us exports and exerted other political pressure while the section
201 tariffs coupled with certain major steel mill closures related to pending
bankruptcies may have caused steel prices to increase substantially in the
first three quarter of 2002 to approximately 400 per ton from their depressed
levels in the low 200s per ton at the end of 2001 prices nonetheless eased
back into the 260270 per ton range by may 2003 as a result of postbankruptcy
capacity restarts and weak us steel demand the negative impact of the
rescission of the section 201 tariffs has been mitigated by a number of factors
that have independently led to a strengthening of us steel pricing including
a weakened us dollar substantial increases in ocean freight and an increase
in the global demand for steel primarily in china

     the rescission of the section 201 tariffs does not affect the antidumping
duties imposed through the itc processes in announcing its december 2003
rescission action the bush administration affirmed its commitment to monitor
steel imports and to file antidumping and countervailing duty petitions if it
determines that unfairly traded steel imports adversely impact or threaten to
adversely impact financial results during 2004 the itc will also commence a
required fiveyear review to determine whether to continue or modify
antidumping findings against hotrolled steel from japan brazil and russia in
addition the existing comprehensive steel trade agreement with russia under
which russia voluntarily limited its exports to the us of steel not otherwise
covered by antidumping orders will expire in july 2004

     the us is also conducting discussions at the organization of economic
cooperation and development with the aim of reducing or eliminating the
subsidization of global inefficient steel production

     structural steel and rail

     by a vote of 42 the itc determined on october 22 2001 that structural
steel and rails were not being imported into the united states in such increased
quantities as to be a substantial cause of serious injury or the threat of
serious injury to the us industry the itc determined that the us structural
steel and rail industry was not seriously injured primarily because of its
doubledigit operating margins and positive performance trends including
increased capacity and shipments higher employment and new investment with
regard to threat of injury the itc found that the existing orders and the
pending investigations made future increases in imports unlikely

     rebar merchant bar and sbq products

     president bushs march 2002 section 201 order granting tariff relief to
various categories of imported steel products included a 15 tariff on rebar and
a 30 tariff on various certain merchant and sbq products these have likewise
now been rescinded

integrated mills versus minimills

     there are generally two kinds of primary steel producers integrated
mills and minimills we are a minimill producer

     steel manufacturing by an integrated producer involves a series of
distinct but related processes often separated in time and in plant geography
the process involves ironmaking followed by steelmaking followed by billet or
slab making followed by reheating and further rolling into steel plate or bar
or flatrolling into sheet steel or coil these processes may in turn be
followed by various finishing processes including coldrolling or various
coating processes including galvanizing in integrated producer steelmaking
coal is converted to coke in a coke oven then combined in a blast furnace with
iron ore or pellets and limestone to produce pig iron and then combined with
scrap in a basic oxygen or other furnace to produce raw or liquid steel once
produced the liquid steel is metallurgically refined and then either poured as
ingots for later reheating and processing or transported to a continuous caster
for casting into a billet or slab which is then further shaped or rolled into
its final form typically though not always and whether by design or as a
result of downsizing or reconfiguration many of these processes take place in
separate and remote facilities

     in contrast minimills such as our butler minimill our columbia city
minimill and our pittsboro indiana minimill use an electric arc furnace to
directly melt scrap or scrap substitutes thus entirely eliminating the
energyintensive blast furnace a minimill unifies the melting casting and the
hotrolling into a continuous process the melting process begins with the
charging of a furnace vessel with scrap steel carbon and lime following which
the furnace vessels top is swung into place electrodes are lowered into the
furnace vessel through holes in top of the furnace and electricity is applied
to melt the scrap the liquid steel is then checked for chemistry and the
necessary metallurgical adjustments are made typically while the steel is still
in the melting furnace or if the plant has a separate staging area for that
process as do our minimills the liquid steel is transported to an area
commonly known as a ladle metallurgy station from there the liquid steel is
transported to a continuous caster which consists of a turret a tundish a
type of reservoir which controls the flow of liquid steel and a watercooled
copperlined mold the liquid steel passes through the continuous caster and
exits as an externally solid slab the slab is then cut to length and proceeds
directly into a tunnel furnace which maintains and equalizes the slabs
temperature after leaving the tunnel furnace the slab is descaled and then it
proceeds into the first stand of a rolling mill operation in the rolling
process the steel is progressively reduced in thickness the final product is
wound into coil and may be sold either directly to endusers or to intermediate
steel processors or service centers where it may be pickled coldrolled
annealed tempered or galvanized

     as a group minimills have historically been characterized by lower costs
of production and higher productivity than integrated mills this was due in
part to lower capital costs and to lower operating costs resulting from their
streamlined melting process and smaller more efficient plant layouts moreover
minimills tended to employ a management culture such as ours that emphasizes
flexible incentiveoriented nonunion labor practices and have tended to be
more willing to adapt to newer and more innovative management styles that
encourage decentralized decisionmaking the smaller plant size of a minimill
also permits greater flexibility in the choice of location for the minimill in
order to optimize access to scrap supply energy costs infrastructure and
markets as is the case with our butler minimill furthermore a minimills
more efficient plant size and layout which incorporates the melt shop
metallurgical station casting and rolling in a unified continuous flow under
the same roof have reduced or eliminated costly rehandling and reheating of
partially finished product they have also adapted quickly to the use of new and
costeffective equipment thereby translating technological advances in the
industry into efficient production however as a result of the movement toward
steel industry consolidation coupled with the emergence from bankruptcy of
previously inefficient and high capital cost and high operating cost steelmaking
assets under new ownership with renegotiated and less burdensome labor
contracts the cost differences between minimills and some integrated mill
consolidators have begun to narrow moreover during periods of high scrap
material costs such as at the present time integrated mills that produce their
own blast furnace iron and are not as dependent as minimills upon scrap for the
bulk of their melt mix actually experience lower raw material metallic costs
than minimills thus further compressing the historical cost differentials
between integrated and minimill steelmaking

the flatroll steel market

     the flatroll steel market represents the largest steel product group
flatrolled products consist of hotrolled coldrolled and coated sheet and
coil

     the following table shows the us shipments of flatrolled steel in net
tons by hotrolled coldrolled and coated production as reported by the
american iron and steel institute or aisa for the five years from 1998 through
2002



                                                                                years ended december 31

metallic coated

     hotrolled products

     all coiled flatrolled steel is initially hotrolled a process that
consists of passing a cast slab through a multistand rolling mill to reduce its
thickness to less than 12 inch hotrolled steel is minimally processed steel
coil that is used in the manufacture of various nonsurface critical
applications such as automobile suspension arms frames wheels and other
unexposed parts in auto and truck bodies agricultural equipment construction
products machinery tubing pipe tools lawn care products and guard rails

     coldrolled products

     coldrolled steel is hotrolled steel that has been further processed
through a pickler and then successively passed through a rolling mill without
reheating until the desired gauge or thickness and other physical properties
have been achieved coldrolling reduces gauge and hardens the steel and when
further processed through an annealing furnace and a temper mill improves
uniformity ductility and formability coldrolling can also impart various
surface finishes and textures coldrolled steel is used in exposed steel
applications that demand higher surface quality or finish such as exposed
automobile and appliance panels as a result coldrolled prices are typically
higher than hotrolled prices typically coldrolled material is coated or
painted

     coated products

     coated steel can be either hotrolled or coldrolled steel that has been
coated with zinc to render it corrosionresistant and to improve its
paintability hotdipped galvanized galvannealed electrogalvanized and
aluminized products are types of coated steels these are also the highest
valueadded sheet products because they require the greatest degree of
processing and tend to have the strictest quality requirements coated steel is
used in high volume applications such as automobiles household appliances
roofing and siding heating and air conditioning equipment air ducts switch
boxes chimney flues awnings garbage cans and food containers

the structural steel market

     the structural steel market is a relatively small part of total us steel
shipments in 2000 2001 and 2002 structural steel shipments were 67 million
tons 69 million tons and 67 million tons respectively and averaging 7 of
the total steel market during these three years consumption of structural steel
products is influenced both by new construction and manufacturing activity and
by the selection of steel over alternative structural or manufacturing
materials which has occurred at a relatively constant rate of 50 over the five
years from 1999 through 2002

the rail market

     rail shipments in 2001 and 2002 were approximately 644000 tons and 791000
tons respectively with standard rail averaging approximately 80 of the market
over 2000 2001 and 2002 and premium or headhardened rail averaging 20 over
2000 2001 and 2002 increased rail hardness results in a longer lasting product
and is achieved by quenching hot rail with either air or water or by changing
rail chemistry through the addition of alloys harder rail is more costly rail
is produced in or imported into the us and canadian markets in standard
lengths of 39 to 80 feet mainly due to the limitations of existing north
american rail production equipment and plant layouts as well as the size
limitations of ocean freighters with respect to imports as a result in order
to produce the 1600foot rail strings desired by railroads 20 80foot rail
sections are required to be welded together each weld is costly to make and
adds installation and periodic maintenance costs

     of the total annual shipments of rail in 2002 approximately 75 was
produced by the two remaining us rail producers and 25 was imported mainly
from japan and from europe there are currently no canadian rail producers

the market for rebar merchant bar and sbq products

     according to data reported by aisi apparent rebar supply in the united
states was approximately 7 million tons in each of 2001 and 2002 and apparent
merchant bar supply typically defined as astm a36 round square or flat bar
with a major dimension less than 3 inches was approximately 2 million tons
nationally for each of 2001 and 2002 according to the aisi apparent supply of
light structural shapes also characterized by a major dimension of less than 3
inches averaged approximately 4 million tons annually for each of the foregoing
two years

     accordingly to aisi data apparent sbq supply has averaged approximately 7
million tons nationally over the 2001 and 2002 period

energy resources

     electricity

     with respect to our butler minimill our electric service contract with
american electric power or aep extends through december 31 2007 the contract
designated only 152 hours as interruptible service during 2003 and these
interruptible hours further decrease annually through expiration of the
agreement the contract also provides that the circumstances necessary to
warrant any hours of service interruptions must be of an emergency nature and
not related to price and demand the contract also establishes an agreed fixed
rate for the rest of our electrical usage interruptible service subjects us to
the risk of interruption at any time in the operation of the aep system whether
as a result of an aep peak demand or even if aep were able to obtain a higher
market price from an alternate buyer

     with respect to our columbia city structural steel and rail minimill the
plant site is located within the service territory of northeast indiana
remc a rural electric cooperative and a member of the wabash valley power
association we have not yet elected to enter into any long term electricity
supply agreement for this minimill and have been able to effectively use spot
market pricing by tailoring our usage to lower cost operating hours once we
enter into a longer term agreement however we will be required to arrange
power transmission over lines owned by american electric power

     with respect to our pittsboro indiana bar mill the plant is located
within the service territory claimed by cinergy formerly known as public
service of indiana we have preliminarily agreed to the terms of an energy
supply contract with cinergy under the terms of which we will be purchasing
electricity at market rates the contract is pending approval by the indiana
utility regulatory commission

     gas

     we use approximately 9000 to 11000 decatherms of natural gas per day in
our butler flatroll minimill a decatherm is equivalent to 1 million btus or
1000 cubic feet of natural gas we have a delivery contract with the panhandle
eastern pipeline that extends through april 2008 relating to our butler
minimill we also have a delivery contract with nipsconiflcrossroads that
extends through october 2005 relating to our butler minimill we maintain a
liquid propane storage facility on site in butler with sufficient reserves to
sustain operations at our flatroll minimill for approximately one week in the
event of an interruption in the natural gas supply

     with respect to our structural steel and rail minimill we have entered
into an agreement with nipsco for gas service under its rate schedule 330 which
will provide firm burnertip supply and transportation service for all natural
gas requirements at this minimill the agreement includes a volumedependent
transportation fee and forgoes all balancing charges this agreement precludes
the need for a separate pipeline transportation agreement the agreement is for
a period of three years beginning with the first use of gas in production we
purchased gas at market prices at commencement of operations and are now
minimizing price volatility by entering into hedging transactions on the futures
markets

     with respect to our pittsboro indiana bar mill we are currently reviewing
but have not yet finalized our gas purchase and transportation arrangements

     other

     we use oxygen nitrogen hydrogen and argon for production purposes which
for our butler minimill we purchase from the adjacent plant of air products
and chemicals inc air products uses its plant not only to supply us but also
to provide oxygen and other gases to other industrial customers as a result we
have been able to effect very favorable oxygen and other gas purchase prices on
the basis of air products volume production praxair inc has built a similar
facility within our columbia city minimill praxair will be a captive facility
to our columbia city minimill air liquide built a plant adjacent to our
pittsboro indiana bar mill under an arrangement with the previous owners of
the mill and we are in the process of negotiating a new contract with air
liquide to determine whether we will be supplied by that facility or will make
arrangements for an alternative source of supply

patents and trademarks

     we have a trademark for the mark sdi and an accompanying design of a
steel coil and a chevron our iron dynamics subsidiary has filed five patent
applications with the us patent and trademark office relating to its methods
of producing low sulfur liquid pig iron as of the date of this filing we have
received three of those patents

research and development

     at the present time we engage in no third party research and development
activities our iron dynamics subsidiary however has been engaged in research
and development efforts in connection with its attempts to develop a process for
the production of direct reduced iron and the conversion of that product into
liquid pig iron most of this research and development effort has been conducted
inhouse by iron dynamics officers and employees

environmental matters

     our operations are subject to substantial and evolving local state and
federal environmental health and safety laws and regulations concerning among
other things emissions to the air discharges to surface and ground water and
to sewer systems noise control and the generation handling storage
transportation treatment and disposal of toxic and hazardous substances in
particular we are dependent upon both state and federal permits regulating
discharges into the air or into the water in order to be permitted to operate
our facilities we believe that in all current respects our facilities are in
material compliance with all provisions of federal and state laws concerning the
environment and we do not believe that future compliance with such provisions
will have a material adverse effect on our results of operations cash flows or
financial condition

     since environmental laws and regulations are becoming increasingly
stringent and the subject of increasingly vigorous enforcement our
environmental capital expenditures and costs for environmental compliance will
likely increase in the future in addition due to the possibility of
unanticipated regulatory or other developments the amount and timing of future
environmental expenditures may vary substantially from those currently
anticipated the cost for current and future environmental compliance may also
place us steel producers at a competitive disadvantage with respect to foreign
steel producers which may not be required to undertake equivalent costs in
their operations

     pursuant to the resource conservation and recovery act or rcra which
governs the treatment handling and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes the
united states environmental protection agency or us epa and authorized state
environmental agencies conduct inspections of rcra regulated facilities to
identify areas where there may have been releases of solid or hazardous
constituents into the environment and require the facilities to take corrective
action to remediate any such releases rcra also allows citizens to bring
certain suits against regulated facilities for potential damages and clean up
our steelmaking facilities are subject to rcra our manufacturing operations
produce various byproducts some of which for example are electric arc
furnace or eaf dust are categorized as industrial or hazardous waste requiring
special handling for disposal or for the recovery of metallics we collect such
byproducts in approved baghouses and other facilities but we are also
examining alternative reclamation technologies to recycle some of these
products the iron dynamics scrap substitute process is an example of such an
alternative while we cannot predict the future actions of the regulators or
other interested parties the potential exists for required corrective action at
these facilities the costs of which could be substantial

     under the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability
act or cercla the us epa and in some instances private parties have the
authority to impose joint and several liability for the remediation of
contaminated properties upon generators of waste current and former site owners
and operators transporters and other potentially responsible parties
regardless of fault or the legality of the original disposal activity many
states including indiana have statutes and regulatory authorities similar to
cercla and to the us epa we have a number of waste handling agreements with
various contractors including a hazardous waste disposal agreement with
envirosafe services of ohio inc to properly dispose of our electric arc
furnace dust and certain other waste products of steelmaking however we cannot
assure you that even if there has been no fault by us we may not still be
cited as a waste generator by reason of an environmental clean up at a site to
which our waste products were transported

     in addition to rcra and cercla there are a number of other environmental
health and safety laws and regulations that apply to our facilities and may
affect our operations

employees

     our work force consisted of approximately 1400 employees at december 31
2003 none of steel dynamics employees are represented by labor unions we
believe that our relationship with our employees is good

risk factors

     the risks described below are not the only ones facing our company
additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial
may also impair our business operations

     our business financial condition or results of operations could be
materially adversely affected by any of these risks

risks related to our industry

      in recent years imports of steel into the united states have adversely
      affected and may again adversely affect us steel prices which would
      impact our sales margins and profitability

     excessive imports of steel into the united states have in recent years and
may again in the future exert downward pressure on us steel prices and
significantly reduce our sales margins and profitability us steel producers
compete with many foreign producers competition from foreign producers is
typically strong but it has greatly increased as a result of an excess of
foreign steelmaking capacity is periodically exacerbated by weakening of the
economies of certain foreign steelmaking countries and is further intensified
during periods when the us dollar is strong relative to foreign currencies
economic difficulties in these countries or a reduction in demand for steel
produced by these countries when those events occur results in lower local
demand for steel products in these countries and tends to encourage greater
steel exports to the united states at depressed prices

     in addition we believe the downward pressure on and depressed levels of
us steel prices in recent years have been further exacerbated by imports of
steel involving dumping and subsidy abuses by foreign steel producers some
foreign steel producers are owned controlled or subsidized by foreign
governments as a result decisions by these producers with respect to their
production sales and pricing are often influenced to a greater degree by
political and economic policy considerations than by prevailing market
conditions realities of the marketplace or consideration of profit or loss for
example between 1998 and 2001 when imports of hotrolled and coldrolled
products increased dramatically domestic steel producers including us were
adversely affected by unfairly priced or dumped imported steel even though
various protective actions taken by the us government during 2001 including
the enactment of various steel import quotas and tariffs resulted in an
abatement of some steel imports during 2002 and 2003 these protective measures
were only temporary many foreign steel manufacturers were granted exemptions
from the application of these measures and president bush in december 2003
rescinded a substantial part of these protective measures the socalled section
201 tariffs as a result of a november 10 2003 word trade organization ruling
declaring that the tariffs on hotrolled and coldrolled finished steel imports
violated global trade rules and as a result of economic and political pressures
from foreign governments including threats of retaliatory tariffs on us
exports moreover there are products and countries that were not covered by
these protective measures and imports of these exempt products or of products
from these countries may have an additional adverse effect upon our revenues and
income in any event when any of these remaining measures expire or if they are
further relaxed or repealed or if increasingly higher us steel prices enable
foreign steelmakers to export their steel products into the united states even
with the presence of duties or tariffs the resurgence of substantial imports of
foreign steel could again create downward pressure on us steel prices

                                       25
page

     certain domestic steel companies as well as labor unions have filed
complaints with the international trade commission and the us department of
commerce against certain hotrolled coldrolled and structural steel imports
in june of 2002 the itc made final negative injury determinations in cases
relating to structural steel imports from china germany italy luxembourg
russia south africa spain and taiwan in addition in august and october of
2002 the itc also made final negative injury determinations in all outstanding
cases relating to coldrolled steel thus ending the investigations without the
imposition of duties these negative determinations may increase the amount of
coldrolled and structural steel imports into the united states and may create
further downward pressure on us steel prices in june of 2002 the united
states granted market economy status to russia which may enable russia to
more effectively defend itself against dumping actions and increase the risk
that russia in the future may dump steel into the us market which may
adversely affect us steel prices moreover in 1999 the united states and
russia entered into a fiveyear comprehensive quota agreement with annual
quantitative limitations on imports into the united states by russian steel
producers with respect to among other things flatrolled structural rail
and bar steel products this fiveyear agreement will terminate on july 12 2004
and it is not expected that the agreement will be renewed given excess capacity
in russia the termination of this agreement may lead to import surges of steel
products from russia which could have adverse effects upon us steel prices

     excess global capacity in the steel industry and the availability of
     competitive substitute materials has resulted in intense competition and
     may continue to exert downward pressure on our pricing

     the highly competitive nature of the industry in part exerts downward
pressure on prices for some of our products competition within the steel
industry both domestically and worldwide is intense and it is expected to
remain so we compete primarily on the basis of 1 price 2 quality and 3
the ability to meet our customers product needs and delivery schedules our
primary competitors have traditionally been other minimills which may have
cost structures and management cultures more similar to ours than integrated
mills however we also compete with many integrated producers of hotrolled
coldrolled and coated products many of which are larger have substantially
greater capital resources and have cost structures that have become much more
competitive largely as a result of the consolidation within the us steel
industry brought about by bankruptcies and the emergence of a number of
integrated steel producers with lower capital costs new or renegotiated union
work rules and labor costs the elimination or reduction of health care and
retirement legacy costs and the introduction of more incentive based
compensation and a more decentralized management structure these integrated
producers most notably international steel group and us steel have cost
structures that are more competitive likewise with their lesser dependence on
scrap as a major component of their melt mix these producers may also have a
raw material cost advantage over the currently high cost of scrap that we must
absorb the emergence of these producers further increases the competitive
environment in the steel industry and may contribute to future price declines

     in addition global overcapacity in steel manufacturing has had a negative
impact on us steel pricing and is likely to continue to persist and could have
a negative impact on our sales margins and profitability over the last decade
the construction of new minimills expansion and improved production
efficiencies of some integrated mills and substantial expansion of foreign steel
capacity have all led to an excess of manufacturing capacity increasingly this
overcapacity when combined with periodic high levels of steel imports into the
united states exerts downward pressure on domestic steel prices including the
prices of our products and has resulted at times in a dramatic narrowing or
with many companies the elimination of gross margins

     in the case of certain product applications we and other steel
manufacturers compete with manufacturers of other materials including plastic
aluminum graphite composites glass wood and concrete

     our level of production and our sales and earnings are subject to
     significant fluctuations as a result of the cyclical nature of the steel
     industry and the industries we serve

     the price of steel and steel products may fluctuate significantly due to
many factors beyond our control this fluctuation directly affects the levels of
our production and our sales and earnings the steel industry is highly
cyclical influenced by a combination of factors including periods of economic
growth or recession strength or weakness of the us dollar worldwide
production capacity levels of steel imports and applicable tariffs as well as
general economic conditions and the condition of certain other industries the
demand for steel products is generally affected by macroeconomic fluctuations in
the united states and global economies in which steel companies sell their
products future economic downturns stagnant economies or currency fluctuations
in the united states or globally could decrease the demand for our products or
increase the amount of imports of steel into the united states either event of
which would decrease our sales margins and profitability

      in addition a disruption or downturn in the automotive oil and gas gas
transmission construction commercial equipment rail transportation
appliance agricultural and durable goods industries could negatively impact our
financial condition production sales margins and earnings we are also
particularly sensitive to trends and events including strikes and labor unrest
that may impact these industries these industries are significant markets for
our products and are themselves highly cyclical

risks related to our business

     technology operating and startup risks associated with our iron dynamics
     scrap substitute project may prevent us from realizing the anticipated
     benefits from this project and could result in a loss of our investment

      if we abandon our iron dynamics project or if its process does not
succeed we will not be able to realize the expected benefits of this project
and will suffer the loss of our entire investment as of december 31 2003 our
investment in the iron dynamics project was 185 million since 1997 our
whollyowned subsidiary iron dynamics has tried to develop and commercialize a
pioneering process of producing a virgin form of iron that might serve as a
lower cost substitute for a portion of the metallic raw material mix that goes
into our electric arc furnaces to be melted into new steel this scrap
substitute project is the first of its kind it involves processes that are
based on various technical assumptions and new applications of technologies that
have yet to be commercially proven since our initial startup in august 1999
we have encountered a number of difficulties associated with major pieces of
equipment and with operating processes and systems throughout the latter part
of each of 1999 and 2000 our iron dynamics facility was shut down during these
shut downs we engaged in time consuming and expensive redesign reengineering
reconstruction and retrofitting of major pieces of equipment systems and
processes as a result the iron dynamics project has taken considerably longer
and has required us to expend considerably greater resources than originally
anticipated in february 2001 we restarted operations at our iron dynamics
facility however in july 2001 we suspended these operations again with no
specific date set for resumption of operations this shut down was a result of

      1 higher than expected startup and process refinement costs

      2 exceptionally high energy costs

      3 low production quantities achieved at the iron dynamics facility and

      4 historically low steel scrap pricing

      these factors made the cost of producing and using iron dynamics scrap
substitute at our flatrolled minimill in july 2001 higher than our cost of
purchasing and using then lower priced and available steel scrap on july 10
2002 we announced that we would begin experimental production trials in the
fourth quarter of 2002 we continued to make refinements to our systems and
processes and in fact began the production trials in the fourth quarter as
planned we successfully completed these trials and concluded that improved
production technology coupled with our new ability to recycle waste material
inputs and the increasingly high cost of scrap made a restart of this production
facility feasible during 2003 we spent approximately 13 million of additional
capital on these modifications and refinements to the iron dynamics process the
restart commenced in december 2003 involving the front part of the iron
dynamics process the production of direct reduced iron on a rotary hearth
furnace and the compaction of the dri into hot briquetted iron or hbi during
december 2003 we produced 15100 tonnes of hbi with an acceptable metallics
content and anticipated cost structure that compares favorably to scrap and
alternative pig iron we have not yet restarted the backend of the iron
dynamics process the conversion of the hbi into liquid pig iron if we
determine that we will be able to produce liquid pig iron in sufficient
quantities and at a cost to be competitive with purchased pig iron we could
begin commercial production of liquid pig iron as well during the second quarter
of 2004

      while we remain optimistic that the remaining startup difficulties with
the equipment technology systems and processes can be resolved our iron
dynamics facility may not be able to consistently operate or be able to produce
steel scrap substitute material whether dri hbi or liquid pig iron in the
quantities and for costs that will enable it to be cost competitive with scrap
or with purchased pig iron moreover our iron dynamics facility may experience
additional shutdowns or equipment failures and such shutdowns or failures may
have a material adverse impact on our liquidity cost structure and earnings

      a substantial portion of our flatrolled products are sold on the spot
      market and therefore our sales margins and earnings are negatively
      impacted by decreases in domestic flatrolled steel prices

      our sales margins and earnings are negatively impacted by decreases in
domestic flatrolled steel prices since a significant portion of our flatrolled
products are sold on the spot market as a result we are vulnerable to
downturns in the domestic flatrolled steel market for the three year period
ended december 31 2003 approximately 90 of our flatroll products were sold
on the spot market under contracts with terms of twelve months or less

      weakness in the automotive industry would result in a substantial
      reduction in demand for our products

      a prolonged weakness in the automotive industry would reduce the demand
for our products and decrease our sales in addition if automobile
manufacturers choose to incorporate more plastics aluminum and other steel
substitutes in their automobiles it could reduce demand for our products our
sales and earnings fluctuate due to the cyclical nature of the automotive
industry the cyclical nature of the automotive industry is affected by such
things as the level of consumer spending the strength or weakness of the us
dollar and the impact of international trade and various factors such as labor
unrest and the availability of raw materials which affect the ability of the
automotive industry to actually build cars while we do not presently sell a
material portion of our steel production directly to the automotive market a
substantial portion of our sales to the intermediate steel processor and service
center market is resold to various companies in the automotive industry

      we may be unable to pass on increases in the cost of scrap and other raw
      materials to our customers which would reduce our earnings

      if we are unable to pass on higher scrap and other raw material costs to
our customers we will be less profitable we may not be able to adjust our
product prices especially in the shortterm to recover the costs of increases
in scrap and other raw material prices which have reached historically high
levels in september 2003 the price of no 1 factory bundles a key scrap
commodity was 166 per ton in february 2004 the price of no 1 factory
bundles was 280 per ton our principal raw material is scrap metal and prices
for scrap are subject to market forces largely beyond our control including
demand by us and international steel producers freight costs and speculation

      a combination of a weak us dollar exceptionally strong chinese and
global demand for scrap and lower production of domestic scrap due to a weak
manufacturing economy and the continued loss of manufacturing to foreign
competition have driven scrap offshore at exceptionally high prices have
reduced the available domestic scrap supply and have caused the price of
domestic scrap to double within the past several months such scrap costs are
unsustainable even with the sharply increased pricing for our manufactured
steel and could erode or eliminate our gross margins during february 2003 we
announced the imposition of scrap surcharges keyed to a published scrap index
on our customers with orders covering multiple months and quarters and we
believe that these will largely be accepted we have no assurance however that
this will continue to be so or that customers will agree to pay ever higher
prices for our steel products sufficient for us to maintain our margins
without resistance or the selection of other suppliers or alternative materials
if this occurs we may lose customers we may be unable to pass these higher
scrap costs on to our customers and we may suffer a loss of earnings moreover
some of our integrated steel producer competitors are not as dependant as we are
on scrap as a major part of their raw material melt mix which during periods
of high scrap costs relative to the cost of blast furnace iron used by the
integrated producers even with the higher costs they must currently pay for
iron ore coke coking coal and other raw materials used in their ironmaking
processes give them a current raw material cost advantage over minimills in
addition our operations require substantial amounts of other raw materials
including various types of alloys refractories oxygen natural gas and
electricity the price and availability of which are also subject to market
conditions

      we have primarily relied upon one supplier to meet our steel scrap
      requirements

      since our inception we have had a purchasing agreement with omnisource
corporation one of the largest scrap processors and brokers in the midwest to
purchase steel scrap for our mills we have determined however that in the
current scrap environment we would be better off having multiple available
sources of scrap supply including our ability to develop our own scrap
purchasing capability with the added flexibility to develop new relationships
and supply agreements with third parties and certain generators of scrap
accordingly we and omnisource have amicably terminated our scrap supply
agreement effective march 31 2004 we plan to continue to purchase scrap from
omnisource as one of our major suppliers we may be unable however to realize
the anticipated benefits of our new scrap purchasing arrangements and we may
not be able to secure substitute arrangements for steel scrap on the same or
better terms as those that were available from omnisource for 2003 we
purchased 26 million tons of steel scrap and scrap substitutes from omnisource
which represented approximately 89 of our total scrap purchased during this
period

      there may be potential conflicts of interest with regard to our
      relationship with omnisource

      with respect to any dispute between us and omnisource involving our
existing contract the termination of our contract or in connection with the
terms of any future commercial transaction omnisource may be viewed as having a
conflict of interest between what it perceives as being best for itself as a
seller of scrap and what is best for us as a buyer of scrap we may not be able
to resolve potential conflicts and if we do resolve them we may receive a less
favorable resolution since omnisource may be viewed as a related party the
chief operating officer of omnisource is also a member of our board of directors
and is a substantial stockholder of steel dynamics this person has obligations
to us as well as to omnisource and may have conflicts of interest with respect
to matters potentially or actually involving or affecting us and omnisource
omnisource also supplies scrap to many other customers including other steel
mills

      we rely upon a small number of major customers for a substantial
      percentage of our sales

      a loss of any large customer or group of customers could materially reduce
our sales and earnings we have substantial business relationships with a few
large customers in 2003 our butler minimills top ten customers accounted for
approximately 42 of our total net sales during this period our largest
customer heidtman accounted for approximately 13 of our total net sales we
expect to continue to depend upon a small number of customers for a significant
percentage of our total net sales and cannot assure you that any of them will
continue to purchase steel from us

                                       28
page

      there may be potential conflicts of interest with regard to our
relationship with heidtman steel products inc

      if a dispute arises between us and heidtman we may be viewed as having a
conflict of interest what is best for heidtman as a buyer and what is best for
us as a product seller may be at odds we may be unable to resolve potential
conflicts if we do resolve them we may receive a less favorable resolution
since we are dealing with heidtman rather than an unaffiliated person heidtman
is an affiliate of one of our large stockholders and its president and chief
executive officer serves as one of our directors this person has obligations to
us as well as to heidtman and may have conflicts of interest with respect to
matters potentially or actually involving or affecting us and heidtman

      startup and operating risks associated with the construction of our
      pittsboro indiana bar products mill could result in materially greater
      operating costs than those we have anticipated

      startup and operating risks associated with the retrofitting and
operation of our pittsboro indiana bar products mill may result in materially
greater operating costs than we initially expected we are subject to all of the
general risks associated with the construction and startup of a new or
reconstructed minimill these risks involve construction delays cost overruns
and startup difficulties we could also experience operational difficulties
after startup that could result in our inability to operate our bar bill at
full or near full capacity

      unexpected equipment failures may lead to production curtailments or
      shutdowns

      interruptions in our production capabilities will inevitably increase our
production costs and reduce our sales and earnings for the affected period in
addition to equipment failures our facilities are also subject to the risk of
catastrophic loss due to unanticipated events such as fires explosions or
violent weather conditions our manufacturing processes are dependent upon
critical pieces of steelmaking equipment such as our furnaces continuous
casters and rolling equipment as well as electrical equipment such as
transformers and this equipment may on occasion be out of service as a result
of unanticipated failures we have experienced and may in the future experience
material plant shutdowns or periods of reduced production as a result of such
equipment failures moreover any interruption in production capability may
require us to make significant capital expenditures to remedy the problem which
could have a negative effect on our profitability and cash flows we may also
sustain revenue losses in excess of any recoveries we make under any applicable
business interruption insurance coverages we may have in addition to such
revenue losses longerterm business disruption could result in a loss of
customers which could adversely affect our business results of operations and
financial condition

      we depend heavily on our senior management and we may be unable to
      replace key executives if they leave

      the loss of the services of one or more members of our senior management
team or our inability to attract retain and maintain additional senior
management personnel could harm our business financial condition results of
operations and future prospects our senior management founded our company
pioneered the development of thinslab flatrolled technology and directed the
construction of our butler flatroll minimill columbia city structural and
rail minimill and our pittsboro bar products minimill our operations and
prospects depend in large part on the performance of our senior management team
including keith e busse president and chief executive officer mark d
millett vice president and general manager of our flat roll division richard
p teets jr vice president and general manager of our structural and rail
division tracy l shellabarger vice president and chief financial officer and
john w nolan vice president sales and marketing although these senior
managers have each been employees and stockholders of steel dynamics for more
than seven years these individuals may not remain with us as employees in
addition we may not be able to find qualified replacements for any of these
individuals if their services are no longer available we do not have key man
insurance on any of these individuals

      we may face risks associated with the implementation of our growth
      strategy

      our growth strategy subjects us to various risks as part of our growth
strategy we may expand our existing facilities build additional plants
acquire other businesses and steel assets enter into joint ventures or form
strategic alliances that we believe will complement our existing business these
transactions will likely involve some or all of the following risks

      o the difficulty of competing for acquisitions and other growth
        opportunities with companies having materially greater financial
        resources than ours

      o the difficulty of integrating the acquired operations and personnel into
        our existing business

      o the potential disruption of our ongoing business

      o the diversion of resources

      o the inability of management to maintain uniform standards controls
        procedures and policies

      o the difficulty of managing the growth of a larger company

                                       29
page

      o the risk of entering markets in which we have little experience

      o the risk of becoming involved in labor commercial or regulatory
        disputes or litigation related to the new enterprise

      o the risk of contractual or operational liability to our venture
        participants or to third parties as a result of our participation

      o the inability to work efficiently with joint venture or strategic
        alliance partners and

      o the difficulties of terminating joint ventures or strategic alliances

      these transactions might be required for us to remain competitive but we
may not be able to complete any such transactions on favorable terms or obtain
financing if necessary for such transactions on favorable terms future
transactions may not improve our competitive position and business prospects as
anticipated and if they do not our sales and earnings may be significantly
reduced

      we may be delayed in the construction and startup or operation of our
pittsboro indiana minimill

      in september 2002 we purchased a special bar quality minimill located in
pittsboro indiana for 45 million and we are in the process of completing
between 75 and 80 million in plant upgrades and retrofitting to convert the
facility from one capable of producing only special bar quality steel products
to a facility capable of also producing merchant bars and shapes and reinforcing
bar products we started melting and casting operations in december 2003 began
shipping limited products by yearend 2003 are currently producing larger mbq
and sbq bars and expect equipment to arrive and be installed in the first
quarter 2004 to enable us to begin to produce the smaller rounds angles flats
channels and products of that nature during the second quarter it may cost more
than the approximately 75 million we estimate is required to convert the
pittsboro minimill into a minimill for the production of merchant and
reinforcing bar we are also subject to construction and startup delays and
operational risks associated with the startup of a new minimill either in
pittsboro minimills present configuration or in connection with its
conversion these factors could result in materially greater operating costs
than we initially expected we may also be delayed as a result of unforeseen
circumstances or events beyond our control

      environmental regulation imposes substantial costs and limitations on our
operations

      we are subject to the risk of substantial environmental liability and
limitations on our operations brought about by the requirements of environmental
laws and regulations we are subject to various federal state and local
environmental health and safety laws and regulations concerning such issues as
air emissions wastewater discharges solid and hazardous materials and waste
handling and disposal and the investigation and remediation of contamination
these laws and regulations are increasingly stringent while we believe that our
facilities are and will continue to be in material compliance with all
applicable environmental laws and regulations the risks of substantial costs
and liabilities related to compliance with such laws and regulations are an
inherent part of our business although we are not currently involved in any
remediation activities it is possible that future conditions may develop arise
or be discovered that create substantial environmental remediation liabilities
and costs for example our steelmaking operations produce certain waste
products such as electric arc furnace dust which are classified as hazardous
waste and must be properly disposed of under applicable environmental laws
these laws can impose clean up liability on generators of hazardous waste and
other substances that are shipped offsite for disposal regardless of fault or
the legality of the disposal activities other laws may require us to
investigate and remediate contamination at our properties including
contamination that was caused in whole or in part by third parties while we
believe that we can comply with environmental legislation and regulatory
requirements and that the costs of doing so have been included within our
budgeted cost estimates it is possible that such compliance will prove to be
more limiting and costly than anticipated

      in addition to potential clean up liability in the past we have been and
in the future we may become subject to substantial monetary fines and penalties
for violation of applicable laws regulations or administrative conditions we
may also be subject from time to time to legal proceedings brought by private
parties or governmental agencies with respect to environmental matters
including matters involving alleged property damage or personal injury

risks related to our company

     we have substantial indebtedness and debt service requirements which limits
our financial and operating flexibility

     as of december 31 2003 we had indebtedness of 111 million under our
senior secured credit facility 300 million in connection with our 9 12
senior unsecured notes due 2009 and 115 million in connection with our 4
convertible subordinated notes due 2012

         our substantial indebtedness limits our financial and operating
flexibility for example it could

      o make it more difficult to satisfy our obligations with respect to our
        debt including our various notes

                                       30

      o limit our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital
        capital expenditures acquisitions or general corporate purposes

      o require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from
        operations to payments on our debt reducing our ability to use these
        funds for other purposes

      o limit our ability to adjust rapidly to changing market conditions and

      o increase our vulnerability to downturns in general economic conditions
        or in our business

     our ability to satisfy our debt obligations will depend upon our future
operating performance which in turn will depend upon the successful
implementation of our strategy and upon financial competitive regulatory
technical and other factors many of which are beyond our control if we are not
able to generate sufficient cash from operations to make payments under our
credit agreements or to meet our other debt service obligations we will need to
refinance our indebtedness our ability to obtain such financing will depend
upon our financial condition at the time the restrictions in the agreements
governing our indebtedness and other factors including general market and
economic conditions if such refinancing were not possible we could be forced
to dispose of assets at unfavorable prices even if we could obtain such
financing we cannot be sure that it would be on terms that are favorable to us
in addition we could default on our debt obligations

     our business requires substantial capital investment and maintenance
     expenditures which we may be unable to provide

     our business strategy may require additional substantial capital
investment we require capital for among other purposes managing acquired
assets acquiring new equipment maintaining the condition of our existing
equipment completing future acquisitions and maintaining compliance with
environmental laws and regulations to the extent that cash generated internally
and cash available under our credit facilities is not sufficient to fund capital
requirements we may require additional debt andor equity financing however
this type of financing may not be available or if available may not be on
satisfactory terms future debt financing if available may result in increased
interest and amortization expense increased leverage and decreased income
available to fund further acquisitions and expansion in addition future debt
financing may limit our ability to withstand competitive pressures and render us
more vulnerable to economic downturns if we fail to generate or obtain
sufficient additional capital in the future we could be forced to reduce or
delay capital expenditures and acquisitions sell assets or restructure or
refinance our indebtedness

     our senior secured credit agreement the indenture relating to our 9 12
     senior unsecured notes due 2009 and the indenture relating to our 4
     convertible subordinated notes due 2012 contain restrictive covenants that
     may limit our flexibility

     restrictions and covenants in our existing debt agreements including our
senior secured credit agreement the indenture relating to our 9 12 senior
unsecured notes due 2009 and the indenture relating to our 4 convertible
subordinated notes due 2012 and any future financing agreements may impair our
ability to finance future operations or capital needs or to engage in other
business activities specifically these agreements will restrict our ability
to

      o incur additional indebtedness

      o pay dividends or make distributions with respect to our capital stock

      o repurchase or redeem capital stock

      o make investments

      o create liens and enter into sale and leaseback transactions

     a breach of any of the restrictions or covenants in our debt agreements
could cause a default under our senior secured credit agreement other debt or
the notes a significant portion of our indebtedness then may become immediately
due and payable we are not certain whether we would have or be able to obtain
sufficient funds to make these accelerated payments including payments on the
notes

     we may not have sufficient cash flow to make payments on our notes and our
     other debt

     our ability to pay principal and interest on our various notes and on our
other debt and to fund our planned capital expenditures depends on our future
operating performance our future operating performance is subject to a number
of risks and uncertainties that are often beyond our control including general
economic conditions and financial competitive regulatory and environmental
factors for a discussion of some of these risks and uncertainties please see
risk factors  risks related to our business consequently we may not have
sufficient cash flow to meet our liquidity needs including making payments on
our indebtedness

     if our cash flow and capital resources are insufficient to allow us to make
scheduled payments on our various notes or on our other debt we may have to
sell assets seek additional capital or restructure or refinance our debt if we
are required to do that the terms of our debt may not allow for these
alternative measures even if permitted such measures might not satisfy our
scheduled debt service obligations

     if we cannot make scheduled payments on our debt

      o our debtholders could declare all outstanding principal and interest to
        be due and payable

      o the lenders under our senior secured credit agreement could terminate
        their commitments and commence foreclosure proceedings against our
        assets and

      o we could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation

      o you could lose all or part of your investment in the notes

     despite our substantial indebtedness we may still incur significantly more
     debt which could further increase the risks described above

     the terms of our senior secured credit agreement and the indentures related
to our 4 convertible subordinated notes due 2012 and our 9 12 senior
unsecured notes due 2009 do not prohibit us or our subsidiaries from incurring
additional indebtedness in the future any additional debt could be senior to
the notes and could increase the risks described above

     our stock price may be volatile and could decline substantially

     our stock price may decline substantially as a result of the volatile
nature of the stock market and other factors beyond our control the stock
market has from time to time experienced extreme price and volume
fluctuations many factors may cause the market price for our common stock to
decline including

      o our operating results failing to meet the expectations of securities
        analysts or investors in any quarter

      o downward revisions in securities analysts estimates

      o material announcements by us or our competitors

      o public sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock

      o governmental regulatory action or

      o adverse changes in general market conditions or economic trends

     in the past companies that have experienced volatility in the market price
of their stock have been the subject of securities class action litigation if
we become involved in securities class action litigation in the future it could
result in substantial costs and diversion of management attention and resources
thus harming our business

     conversion of our 4 convertible subordinated notes due 2012 will dilute
     the ownership interests of existing stockholders

     the conversion of some or all of our 4 convertible subordinated notes due
2012 will dilute the ownership interest of existing stockholders if all notes
are converted an additional 6762874 shares of our common stock will be
issued which has the effect of diluting earnings per share moreover any sales
in the public market of the common stock issuable upon such conversion could
adversely affect prevailing market prices of our common stock in addition the
existence of the notes may encourage short selling by market participants
because the conversion of the notes could depress the price of our common stock

     shares eligible for public sale could adversely affect our stock price

     the future sale of a substantial number of our shares of common stock in
the public market or the perception that such sales could occur could
significantly reduce our stock price it could also make it more difficult for
us to raise funds through equity offerings in the future as of february 20
2004 we had 49007605 shares of common stock outstanding including 10007 565
restricted shares held by some of our stockholders this does not include the
6762874 shares of common stock that are issuable upon conversion of our 4
convertible subordinated notes due 2012 the restricted shares may in the future
be sold without registration under the securities act of 1933 to the extent
permitted by rule 144 under the securities act or any applicable exemption under
the securities act

     in addition we have filed registration statements under the securities act
to register shares of common stock reserved for issuance under our stock option
plans thus permitting the resale of such shares by nonaffiliates upon issuance
in the public market without restriction under the securities act as of
december 31 2003 options to purchase 2338408 shares were outstanding under
these stock option plans

     we do not expect to pay cash dividends in the foreseeable future

     since our initial public offering we have not declared or paid cash or
other dividends on our common stock and do not expect to pay cash dividends for
the foreseeable future we currently intend to retain all future earnings for
use in the operation of our business and to fund future growth in addition the
terms of our senior secured credit agreement and the indenture relating to our
senior notes restrict our ability to pay cash dividends even if these
restrictions are removed any future cash dividends will depend upon our results
of operations financial conditions cash requirements the availability of a
surplus and other factors

     provisions under indiana law may deter acquisition bids for us

     provisions under the indiana business corporation law may have the effect
of delaying or preventing transactions involving a change of control including
transactions in which stockholders might otherwise receive a substantial premium
for their shares over then current market prices as a result these provisions
may limit the ability of stockholders to approve transactions that they may deem
to be in their best interest or may delay or frustrate the removal of incumbent
directors

of operations

     the following discussion contains forwardlooking statements that involve
numerous risks and uncertainties our actual results could differ materially
from those discussed in the forwardlooking statements as a result of these
risks and uncertainties including those set forth in this report under
forwardlooking statements and under risk factors you should read the
following discussion in conjunction with selected financial data and our
consolidated financial statements and notes appearing elsewhere in this filing

     business discussion

     we are a domestic steel manufacturing company that primarily owns and
operates electric arc furnace minimills our steel operations include a flat
roll division a structural and rail division and a bar products division

     our flat roll division is currently our core business and consists of a
flatroll minimill located in butler indiana which we built and have operated
since 1996 with an annual estimated production capacity of 22 million tons of
flatrolled steel although we achieved record production of 24 million tons
during the last two years our flat roll division produces a broad range of
highquality hotrolled coldrolled and coated steel products including a
large variety of valueadded and highmargin specialty products such as
thinnergauge rolled products and galvanized products we sell our flatrolled
products directly to endusers intermediate steel processors and service
centers located primarily in the midwestern united states our flatrolled
products are used in numerous industry sectors including the automotive
construction and commercial industries our largest customer heidtman steel
products inc heidtman purchased 1328 million of our flatrolled products
or 13 of our consolidated net sales during 2003 sales from our flat roll
division accounted for 77 of our consolidated net sales during 2003

     during 2003 our flat roll division constructed a new coil coating facility
at our butler minimill at a cost of approximately 25 million we commenced
coating operations during the later part of the fourth quarter 2003 and produced
6000 tons this facility has an annual estimated production capacity of 240000
tons of coated flatrolled products we are currently operating at approximately
57 of capacity as another addition to our flat roll division on march 14
2003 we purchased the galvanizing assets of galvpro ii llc for 175 million
plus a potential of an additional 15 million based on an earnout formula
this steel coating facility is located in jeffersonville indiana and has an
estimated annual production capacity of between 300000 and 350000 tons of
lightgauge hotdipped coldrolled galvanized steel we restarted operations
at jeffersonville midyear and are currently operating at approximately 87 of
our average capacity expectations we supply the jeffersonville facility with
steel coils from our flat roll division these additions to our flat roll
division should enable us to further increase our mix of highermargin
valueadded steel product sales

     we began construction of our structural and rail division located in
columbia city indiana in may 2001 and commenced commercial structural steel
operations during the third quarter of 2002 our structural and rail minimill
is designed to have an annual production capacity of up to 13 million tons of
structural steel beams pilings and other steel components as well as standard
and premiumgrade rails we are currently producing at approximately 68 of
capacity and structural steel product sales accounted for 15 of our
consolidated net sales during 2003 we expect to ship standard rail products
during the first half of 2004 the initial rail shipments will be used in a
testing capacity to be monitored by individual railroad companies for evaluation
purposes this evaluation process may take up to nine months for completion the
company generally sells its structural products directly to endusers and steel
service centers to be used primarily in the construction transportation and
industrial machinery markets

      on september 9 2002 we purchased the special bar quality minimill
assets of qualitech steel sbq llc located in pittsboro indiana for 45
million we plan to invest between 75 and 80 million of additional capital to
convert the facility to the production of merchant bars and shapes and
reinforcing bar products while retaining the ability to produce special bar
quality sbq steel as of december 31 2003 we had invested 507 million
including capitalized interest the facilitys anticipated annual production
capacity is between 500000 and 600000 tons on december 29 2003 the bar
products division began commissioning and successfully produced certain sbq and
merchant bar quality mbq rounds we expect to increase our sbq and mbq product
offerings throughout the first half of 2004 and anticipate the addition of
angles flats and channels during the third quarter our bar products division
plans to market the bar products directly to endusers and to service centers
for the construction transportation and industrial machinery markets

     metallic raw materials used in our electric arc furnaces represent our
singlemost significant manufacturing cost and historically has generally
accounted for between 45 and 50 of our consolidated cost of goods sold
however due to increasing metallic raw material costs we believe it is likely
that this percentage will be higher during 2004 the metallic raw material mix
utilized in our electric arc furnaces is composed of approximately 85 steel
scrap and 15 alternative iron units from the second quarter of 2000 throughout
2001 we experienced a steady decline in metallic raw material pricing reaching
historically low levels in the fourth quarter of 2001 however during 2002 and
through current markets we have experienced a steady pricing increase metallic
raw material costs are now at historical highs we believe this increase is
partly due to a weakened us dollar less than normal production of domestic
scrap and increased demand for these metals from foreign steel manufacturers we
believe the volatility of the metallic market necessitates the generation of a
cost effective alternative iron source


                                       37
page

     since 1997 in an effort to reduce our exposure to the volatile metals
markets we have tried to develop and commercialize a pioneering process for the
production of a virgin form of iron which might serve as a lowercost substitute
for the alternative iron units utilized in our electric arc furnaces for melting
into new steel our process involves the production and conversion of
directreduced iron into liquid pig iron at our ironmaking facility iron
dynamics since we began initial operations at iron dynamics in 1999 the
facility has produced and sold a minimal amount of liquid pig iron to our flat
roll division during 1999 and 2000 we encountered a number of difficulties
associated with major pieces of equipment and operating processes causing us to
shut down the facility for redesign reengineering and retrofitting in july
2001 we indefinitely suspended operations due to a higherthanexpected
startup and process refinement costs b lowerthanexpected production
quantities c exceptionally high energy costs and d then historically low
steel scrap pricing these factors made the cost of producing and using iron
dynamics scrap substitute at our flat roll division higher than our cost of
purchasing and using steel scrap or pig iron during the next year we continued
to evaluate our systems and processes during the fourth quarter of 2002 iron
dynamics successfully completed certain operating trials utilizing a modified
production process this process may significantly reduce the eventual perunit
cost of liquid pig iron production throughout 2003 we invested 133 million
for capital expenditures required to implement this modified production process
and iron dynamics restarted operations midnovember producing approximately
15100 tonnes of hot briquetted iron during december since restart the flat
roll division has successfully used these iron briquettes as a part of its
metallic raw material inputs we intend to restart the iron dynamics submerged
arc furnace during the first quarter of 2004 or early in the second quarter
this final stage of the idi production process involves the liquefaction of the
solid iron briquettes to produce liquid pig iron

     income statement classifications

     net sales our total net sales are a factor of net tons shipped product
mix and related pricing our net sales are determined by subtracting product
returns sales discounts return allowances and claims from total sales we
charge premium prices for certain grades of steel dimensions of product or
certain smaller volumes based on our cost of production we also charge
marginally higher prices for our valueadded products from our cold mill these
products include hotrolled and coldrolled galvanized products and coldrolled
products


     cost of goods sold our cost of goods sold represents all direct and
indirect costs associated with the manufacture of our products the principal
elements of these costs are steel scrap and scrap substitutes alloys natural
gas argon direct and indirect labor benefits electricity oxygen electrodes
depreciation and freight our metallic raw materials steel scrap and scrap
substitutes represent the most significant component of our cost of goods sold


     selling general and administrative expenses selling general and
administrative expenses consist of all costs associated with our sales finance
and accounting materials and transportation and administrative departments
these costs include labor and benefits professional services financing cost
amortization property taxes profitsharing expense and startup costs
associated with new projects


     interest expense interest expense consists of interest associated with our
senior credit facilities and other debt agreements as described in the notes to
our financial statements contained elsewhere in this filing net of required
capitalized interest costs that are related to construction expenditures during
the construction period of capital projects

     other income expense other income consists of interest income earned on
our cash balances and any other nonoperating income activity including
insurance proceeds from litigation efforts other expense consists of any
nonoperating costs including otherthantemporary impairments of reported
investments and settlement costs from litigation efforts

     operating results 2003 vs 2002

     net income was 471 million or 98 per diluted shared during 2003
compared with 779 million or 164 per diluted share during 2002 this
decrease in our net income during 2003 was due to dramatically increased costs
of our metallic raw materials steel scrap and scrap substitute

     net sales during 2003 our consolidated net sales increased 1228
million or 14 to 9872 million and our consolidated shipments increased
427000 tons or 18 to 28 million tons compared with 2002 these increases
were due primarily to 2003 being the first full year of operations for our
structural and rail division we had structural sales to external customers of
1455 million and shipments of 462000 tons during 2003 a 1280 million
increase in sales and 401000 ton increase in shipments from 2002 structural
products accounted for 16 of our consolidated shipments during 2003 compared
to 3 during 2002



                                       38

     our average consolidated selling price decreased 12 per ton to 350 per
ton during 2003 our flat roll division accounted for 77 of our consolidated
net sales during 2003 and its pricing decreased approximately 11 per ton
compared to 2002 domestic flatrolled steel product pricing decreased during
the first half of 2003 compared to the last half of 2002 due in part to the
weakened economy and added domestic flatrolled production capacity with signs
of a strengthening us economy during the second half of 2003 through the date of
this filing we began to experience increased demand and product pricing for
most of our steel product offerings our divisions currently have full order
books and we anticipate strong sales during at least the first half of 2004

     cost of goods sold cost of goods sold increased 1884 million or 29
during 2003 to 8273 million compared with 2002 as a percentage of net sales
cost of goods sold represented approximately 84 and 74 during the years 2003
and 2002 respectively we experienced a narrowing of our gross margin
throughout 2003 as our average sales price per ton increased more slowly than
our average metallic raw material cost per ton which is the most significant
single component of our cost of goods sold metallic raw materials represented
53 and 48 of our cost of goods sold during 2003 and 2002 respectively we
experienced a steady increase in metallic costs from the first quarter of 2002
through the end of 2003 and we anticipated further increases during the first
half of 2004 our metallic raw material cost increased 29 per net ton charged
during 2003 while our average consolidated sales price decreased 12 per ton
beginning in 2004 we announced our intention to pass some of these increased
costs associated with rising metallic prices through to our customers in the
form of a scrap surcharge tied to an indexed scrap number we believe that this
scrap surcharge in conjunction with a general increase in our base product
pricing and stronger demand will result in an increase in our gross margin
during the first quarter of 2004

     selling general and administrative expenses selling general and
administrative expenses were 634 million or 6 of net sales during 2003 as
compared to 673 million or 8 of net sales during 2002 a portion of these
expenses in both years was attributable to performancerelated employee
incentive programs and facility startup costs costs associated with our
performancerelated employee profitsharing plan decreased 33 million during
2003 as compared to 2002 which was a record year for pretax income during
2003 costs associated with startup activities at our bar products division
principally were 79 million compared to startup costs during 2002 of 132
million which related most significantly to our structural and rail division

     interest expense interest expense was 345 million during 2003 as
compared to 302 million during 2002 an increase of 43 million or 14 this
increase in our net interest expense during 2003 was due to a decrease of 36
million in interest required to be capitalized in connection with our
construction projects our gross interest expense remained relatively flat at
423 million during 2003

     gain from debt extinguishment in january 2002 we entered into an
agreement with the iron dynamics lenders to extinguish the debt under the idi
senior secured credit agreement at the end of march 2002 there was a provision
within the agreement that if iron dynamics resumed operations by january 27
2007 and generated positive cash flow as defined in the settlement agreement
we would be required to make contingent future payments in an aggregate amount
not to exceed 220 million during december 2003 by agreement with the iron
dynamics lenders we paid 80 million in cash to the idi lenders terminating
all of our obligations to make any additional future payments under the
settlement agreement our 2003 financial statements reflect an ordinary noncash
gain of 140 million from the extinguishment of the 220 million contingent
liability


     other income expense other expense was 664000 during 2003 as compared
to 37 million during 2002 during 2002 we recorded settlement costs of 45
million net of insurance proceeds in association with the nsmrelated
lawsuits

     income taxes during 2003 our income tax provision was 283 million as
compared to 466 million during 2002 our effective tax rate was 375 and
374 for 2003 and 2002 respectively during 2003 we realized a 19 million
valuation allowance that was created in 2001 for foreign tax credit
carryforwards

     operating results 2002 vs 2001

     net sales our net sales were 8645 million with total shipments of 24
million net tons during 2002 as compared to net sales of 6070 million with
total shipments of 20 million net tons during 2001 an increase in net sales of
2575 million or 42 and an increase in total shipments of 427000 net tons
or 22 the entire steel industry experienced pricing declines from the second
half of 2000 throughout 2001 reaching the low in the fourth quarter of 2001
however during 2002 prices of domestic flatrolled steel which accounted for
93 of our consolidated net sales during the year increased dramatically to
more normalized levels during 2002 our average consolidated selling price per
ton increased approximately 53 or 17 in comparison to 2001

     cost of goods sold cost of goods sold was 6389 million during 2002 as
compared to 5229 million during 2001 an increase of 1160 million or 22
which was due in large part to record sales and production volumes as a
percentage of net sales cost of goods sold represented approximately 74 and
86 during the years 2002 and 2001 respectively we experienced a narrowing of
our gross margin throughout 2001 as our average sales price per ton decreased
more rapidly than our average metallic raw material cost per ton which is the
most significant single component of our cost of goods sold however during
2002 our gross margin strengthened as our average product pricing increased by
a greater degree than our average metallic costs and as we realized greater
operating efficiencies through increased production metallic raw materials
represented 48 and 44 of our cost of goods sold during 2002 and 2001
respectively we experienced a steady decline in metallic costs from the second
quarter of 2000 through the first quarter of 2002 at which time this downward
trend ended our average metallic raw material cost per hotband ton produced
was 6 or 5 higher during 2002 than during 2001

     selling general and administrative expenses selling general and
administrative expenses were 673 million during 2002 as compared to 581
million during 2001 an increase of 91 million or 16 a portion of these
expenses in both years was attributable to performancerelated employee
incentive programs facility startup costs and litigation costs associated
with the nakornthai strip mill public company ltd or nsm litigation efforts
costs associated with our performancerelated employee profitsharing plan
increased approximately 72 million during our record earnings year of 2002 as
compared to 2001 during the first six months of 2002 costs associated with
startup activities at our structural and rail division were 132 million
compared to startup costs during 2001 of 195 million of which 84 million
related to the structural and rail division and 110 million related to iron
dynamics litigation costs associated with the nsm litigation efforts were
262000 and 89 million during 2002 and 2001 respectively as a percentage of
net sales selling general and administrative expenses represented
approximately 8 and 10 during 2002 and 2001 respectively


     interest expense interest expense was 302 million during 2002 as
compared to 185 million during 2001 an increase of 117 million or 63
during 2002 gross interest expense increased 22 to 416 million and
capitalized interest decreased 18 to 114 million as compared to 2001 the
increase in our gross interest expense despite the 7 decrease in our total
debt was due to an increase in our average interest rate caused by the march
2002 refinancing in which we accessed traditionally higherpriced public debt
markets the decrease in our capitalized interest resulted from the reduction of
interest required to be capitalized with respect to our structural and rail
division since construction was substantially complete at june 30 2002


     other income expense other expense was 37 million during 2002 as
compared to 23 million during 2001 an increase of 14 million on may 6
2002 we settled the remaining lawsuit associated with the nsm litigation we
recorded settlement costs of 45 million and 23 million net of any insurance
proceeds in association with the nsmrelated lawsuits during 2002 and 2001
respectively

     income taxes during 2002 our income tax provision was 466 million as
compared to 20 million during 2001 our effective tax rate was 374 and 385
for 2002 and 2001 respectively during 2001 we recorded a 19 million
deferred tax asset valuation allowance related to foreign tax credits that may
not be fully realized this allowance was still outstanding at december 31
2002

     extraordinary items during 2002 we recorded an extraordinary loss of 35
million less a related tax benefit of 21 million related to the writeoff of
deferred financing costs due to our march and december refinancing activities
in accordance with guidance included in fasb 145 this loss is no longer
classified as an extraordinary item in our 2002 statement of income at december
31 2003 the loss is now included at the gross amount in selling general and
administrative expenses

liquidity and capital resources

     our business is capital intensive and requires substantial expenditures
for among other things the purchase and maintenance of equipment used in our
steelmaking and finishing operations and to remain in compliance with
environmental laws our shortterm and longterm liquidity needs arise primarily
from capital expenditures working capital requirements and principal and
interest payments related to our outstanding indebtedness we have met these
liquidity requirements with cash provided by operations equity longterm
borrowings state and local grants and capital cost reimbursements

     we believe the principal indicators of our liquidity are our cash position
excess working capital and availability of cash under our capital structure as
of december 31 2003 our cash and equivalents totaled 654 million compared
with 242 million at december 31 2002 the increase of 412 million in cash
was primarily due to financing activities undertaken in the fourth quarter of
2003 we received net proceeds of approximately 1088 million from the issuance
of an additional 1000 million of our 9 12 senior unsecured notes due march
2009 we used 588 million of the net proceeds to prefund certain capital
expenditures expected to occur during the first half of 2004 and we used 500
million to prepay a portion of our senior secured term b loan credit facility

     working capital during 2003 our operational working capital position
representing our cash invested in trade receivables and inventories less trade
payables and accruals increased 32 million to 1732 million as compared to
december 31 2002 trade receivables increased 75 million during 2003 to
1260 million of which 1247 million or 99 were less than 60 days over
due our largest customer is an affiliated company heidtman steel which
represented 20 of our outstanding trade receivables at december 31 2003
during 2003 our inventories increased 313 million to 1845 million
primarily due to the 263 million increase in our finished goods inventories
from the rampup of our structural and rail division we anticipate our trade
receivables and inventories to further increase throughout 2004 as our
structural and rail and bar products divisions continue to rampup their
operations our trade payables increased 331 million during 2003 due to our
new operations and due to the increased costs of metallic raw materials at
december 31 2003 we owed our primary metallic raw material supplier 178
million more when compared to december 31 2002


                                       40

     capital expenditures during 2003 we invested 1373 million in property
plant and equipment related to our new divisions and improvement projects in our
existing facilities we invested 507 million including capitalized interest
in our bar products division 226 million in the completion of our structural
and rail division and 248 million for the addition of a paint line at our
flat roll division we also purchased a satellite galvanizing facility in march
2003 for approximately 190 million which includes a potential 15 million
earnout payment and we increased our ownership of new millennium from 466 to
100 for approximately 83 million we believe these capital investments will
increase our net sales and related cash flows as each project develops as
previously discussed in our business discussion

     capital resources as of december 31 2003 750 million under our senior
secured revolving credit facility remained undrawn and available our ability to
draw down the revolver is dependent upon our continued compliance with the
financial covenants and other covenants contained in our senior secured credit
agreement we were in compliance with these covenants at december 31 2003 and
expect to be in compliance during 2004 our senior secured credit agreement is
secured by liens and mortgages on substantially all of our personal and real
property assets by liens and mortgages on substantially all of the personal and
real property assets of our whollyowned subsidiaries excluding new millennium
building systems and by pledges of all shares of capital stock and
intercompany debt held by us and each whollyowned subsidiary in addition our
whollyowned subsidiaries excluding new millennium building systems have
guaranteed our obligations under the senior secured credit agreement the senior
secured credit agreement contains financial covenants and other covenants that
limit or restrict our ability to make capital expenditures incur indebtedness
permit liens on our property enter into transactions with affiliates make
restricted payments or investments enter into mergers acquisitions or
consolidations conduct asset sales pay dividends or distributions and enter
into other specified transactions and activities we are also required to prepay
any amounts that we borrowed with the proceeds we receive from a number of
specified events or transactions

     in january 2002 we entered into an agreement with the iron dynamics
lenders to extinguish the debt under the idi senior secured credit agreement at
the end of march 2002 we complied with each of the settlement requirements
thus constituting full and final settlement of all of iron dynamics obligations
and the steel dynamics guarantees under the iron dynamics credit agreement in
meeting the requirements of the settlement agreement we paid 150 million in
cash and issued an aggregate of 220 million or 15 million shares of our
common stock during march 2002 in addition there was a provision within the
agreement that if iron dynamics resumed operations by january 27 2007 and
generated positive cash flow as defined in the settlement agreement we would
be required to make contingent future payments in an aggregate amount not to
exceed 220 million at december 31 2002 the contingent future payments were
reflected as an other longterm contingent liability within our financial
statements during december 2003 by agreement with the iron dynamics lenders
we paid 80 million in cash to the iron dynamics lenders terminating all of
our obligations to make any additional future payments under the settlement
agreement our 2003 financial statements reflect a noncash gain of 140
million from the extinguishment of the 220 million contingent liability

     during 2003 we received benefits from state and local governments in the
form of real estate and personal property tax abatements of approximately 54
million based on our current abatements and utilizing our existing longlived
asset structure we estimate the remaining annual effect on future operations to
be approximately 56 million 42 million 29 million 21 million 13
million 798000 433000 285000 and 200000 during the years 2004
through 2012 respectively

     our ability to meet our debt service obligations and reduce our total debt
will depend upon our future performance which in turn will depend upon general
economic financial and business conditions along with competition legislation
and regulation factors that are largely beyond our control in addition we
cannot assure you that our operating results cash flow and capital resources
will be sufficient for repayment of our indebtedness in the future we believe
that based upon current levels of operations and anticipated growth cash flow
from operations together with other available sources of funds including
additional borrowings under our senior secured credit agreement will be
adequate for the next two years for making required payments of principal and
interest on our indebtedness and for funding anticipated capital expenditures
and working capital requirements

certain of our contractual obligations will require futures cash payments as
follows

other matters

     inflation

     we believe that inflation has not had a material effect on our results
of operations

     environmental and other contingencies

     we have incurred and in the future will continue to incur capital
expenditures and operating expenses for matters relating to environmental
control remediation monitoring and compliance we believe apart from our
dependence on environmental construction and operating permits for our existing
and proposed manufacturing facilities that compliance with current
environmental laws and regulations is not likely to have a materially adverse
effect on our financial condition results of operations or liquidity however
environmental laws and regulations have changed rapidly in recent years and we
may become subject to more stringent environmental laws and regulations in the
future

     recent accounting pronouncements

     in april 2002 the financial accounting and standards board fasb issued
statement no 145 fas 145 rescission of fasb statements no 4 44 64
amendment of fasb statement no 13 and technical corrections this statement
rescinded fas 4 which required all gains and losses from extinguishment of debt
to be aggregated and classified as an extraordinary item net of the related
income tax effect within the statement of income we adopted fas 145 in january
2003 as required upon adoption any gain or loss on extinguishment of debt that
was classified as an extraordinary item in prior periods that did not meet the
criteria in apb 30 for classification as an extraordinary item was reclassified
as income or loss from continuing operations the loss on extinguishment of debt
we recorded in 2002 of 35 million net of related tax of 21 million is no
longer classified as an extraordinary item in our statement of income the loss
is now included at the gross amount in selling general and administrative
expenses

     in november 2002 the fasb issued interpretation no 45 fin 45
guarantors accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees including
indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others fin 45 requires a company at
the time it issues certain guarantees to recognize an initial liability for the
fair value of the obligations assumed under the guarantee fin 45 also provides
guidance concerning existing disclosure requirements related to guarantees and
warranties we adopted fin 45 as of december 31 2002 as required and the
adoption did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial
statements

     in january 2003 the fasb issued interpretation no 46 revised december
2003 fin 46r consolidation of variable interest entities an interpretation
of arb no 51 fin 46r provides a new framework for identifying variable
interest entities vies and determining when a company should include the
assets liabilities noncontrolling interests and results of activities of a
vie in its consolidated financial statements and provides guidance related to a
companys initial and subsequent measurement of newly consolidated vies in
general a vie is a corporation partnership limitedliability corporation
trust or any other legal structure used to conduct activities or hold assets
that either has an insufficient amount of equity to carry out is principal
activities without additional subordinated financial support a group of equity
owners that are unable to make significant decisions about its activities or a
group of equity owners that do not have the obligation to absorb losses or the
right to receive returns generated by its operations

     fin 46r requires a vie to be consolidated if a party with an ownership
contractual or other financial interest in the vie is obligated to absorb a
majority of the risk of loss from the vies activities is entitled to receive a
majority of the vies residual returns or both fin 46r must be applied to all
entities subject to this interpretation as of march 31 2004 however prior to
the required application of this interpretation fin 46r must be applied to
those entities that are considered to be specialpurpose entities as of december
31 2003 there was no impact to our financial statements from the application
of this interpretation at december 31 2003 at this time we do not believe the
adoption of fin 46r will have a material impact on our consolidated financial
statements

     in april 2003 the fasb issued fas no 149 fas 149 accounting for
derivative instruments and hedging activities the statement amends and
clarifies accounting for derivative instruments including certain derivative
instruments embedded in other contracts and for hedging activities under fas
133 the amendments set forth in fas 149 improve financial reporting by
requiring that contracts with comparable characteristics be accounted for
similarly fas 149 is effective for contracts entered into or modified after
june 30 2003 except for certain outlined exceptions we adopted this with no
initial impact to our financial statements

     in may 2003 the fasb issued fas no 150 fas 150 accounting for certain
financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity fas
150 changes the accounting for certain financial instruments that under
previous guidance could be classified as equity or mezzanine equity by now
requiring these instruments be classified as liabilities or assets in some
circumstances in the balance sheet further fas 150 requires disclosure
regarding the terms of those instruments and settlement alternatives the
guidance is generally effective for all financial instruments entered into or
modified after may 31 2003 and is otherwise effective at the beginning of the
first interim period beginning after june 15 2003 we adopted fas 150 with no
initial impact to our financial statements

     critical accounting policies and estimates

     managements discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results
of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements which have
been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the
united states of america we review the accounting policies we use in reporting
our financial results on a regular basis the preparation of these financial
statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported
amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosure of
contingent assets and liabilities we evaluate the appropriateness of these
estimations and judgments on an ongoing basis we base our estimates on
historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be
reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for
making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not
readily apparent from other sources results may differ from these estimates due
to actual outcomes being different from those on which we based our assumptions
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more
significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated
financial statements

     revenue recognition and allowance for doubtful accounts we recognize
revenues from sales and the allowance for estimated costs associated with
returns from these sales when the title of the product transfers upon shipment
provision is made for estimated product returns and customer claims based on
estimates and actual historical experience if the historical data used in our
estimates does not reflect future returns and claims trends additional
provision may be necessary our steel joist and steel decking operation new
millennium building systems recognizes revenues from construction contracts on
a percentage of completion method based on steel consumed to date as a
percentage of the estimated total steel required for each contract new
millennium accounted for 5 of our 2003 net sales

     we are exposed to credit risk in the event of nonpayment by our customers
which are principally within the intermediate steel processor service center
automotive and construction industries we maintain an allowance for doubtful
accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to
make required payments based on known credit risks historical loss experience
and current economic conditions affecting our customers we mitigate our
exposure to credit risk by performing ongoing credit evaluations and taking
further action when necessary such as requiring letters of credit or other
security interests to support the receivable from our customer if the financial
condition of our customers were to deteriorate resulting in the impairment of
their ability to make payments additional allowance may be required

     impairments of longlived assets in accordance with the methodology
described in fasb statement no 144 accounting for the impairment or disposal
of longlived assets we review longlived assets for impairment whenever
events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of such assets
may not be recoverable impairment losses are recorded on longlived assets used
in operations when indicators of impairment are present and the undiscounted
cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than the assets
carrying amounts the impairment loss is measured by comparing the fair value of
the asset to its carrying amount

     during 2003 events and circumstances indicated that 125 million of assets
related to iron dynamics might be impaired however our estimate of
undiscounted cash flows was approximately 54 million in excess of such carrying
amounts and therefore no charge has been recorded at december 31 2003 we
made various assumptions in estimating the undiscounted cash flows including
among other things a weighted average of the most likely achieved production
levels significant cost components required capital expenditures and the
rampup of commercial production nonetheless it is reasonably possible that
our estimate of undiscounted cash flows may change in the near term due to
among other things technological changes economic conditions and changes in
the business model or changes in operating performance resulting in the need to
writedown those assets to fair value

     deferred tax assets and liabilities we are required to estimate our income
taxes as a part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial
statements this requires us to estimate our actual current tax exposure
together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing
treatments of items for tax and accounting purposes these differences result in
deferred tax assets and liabilities which are included within our consolidated
balance sheet we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets
will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent we believe that
recovery is not likely we must establish a valuation allowance as of december
31 2003 we had available net operating loss carryforwards of approximately 30
million and capital loss carryforwards of approximately 5 million which expire
beginning 2021 and 2005 respectively during 2003 we were unable to utilize a
3 million foreign tax credit carryforward which we had created a valuation
allowance of 2 million for in 2001 therefore the valuation allowance was
realized in 2003

item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk

     market risk

     in the normal course of business we are exposed to interest rate changes
our objectives in managing exposure to interest rate changes are to limit the
impact of these rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower overall
borrowing costs to achieve these objectives we primarily use interest rate
swaps to manage net exposure to interest rate changes related to our portfolio
of borrowings we generally maintain fixed rate debt as a percentage of our net
debt between a minimum and maximum percentage a portion of our debt has an
interest component that resets on a periodic basis to reflect current market
conditions the following table represents the principal cash repayments and
related weightedaverage interest rates by maturity date for our longterm debt

     commodity risk

     in the normal course of business we are exposed to the market risk and
price fluctuations related to the sale of steel products and to the purchase of
commodities used in our production process such as metallic raw materials
electricity natural gas and alloys our risk strategy associated with product
sales has generally been to obtain competitive prices for our products and to
allow operating results to reflect market price movements dictated by supply and
demand during 2003 approximately 10 of our net sales were under fixedprice
contracts with greater than twelve month commitments

     our risk strategy associated with the purchase of commodities utilized
within our production process has generally been to make certain commitments
with suppliers relating to future expected requirements for such commodities
certain of these commitments contain provisions which require us to take or
pay for specified quantities without regard to actual usage for periods of up
to 3 years during the years ending december 31 2004 2005 and 2006 we have
commitments for natural gas and its transportation with take or pay or other
similar commitment provisions for approximately 232 million 88 million and
492000 respectively we fully utilized all such take or pay requirements
during the past three years and purchased 169 million 140 million and 127
million during the years ended december 31 2003 2002 and 2001 respectively
under these contracts we believe that our production requirements will be such
that consumption of the products or services purchased under these commitments
will occur in the normal production process

     we also purchase electricity consumed at our flat roll division pursuant to
a contract which extends through december 2007 the contract designates 152
hours as interruptible service during 2004 and these interruptible hours
further decrease annually through expiration of the agreement the contract also
establishes an agreed fixed rate energy charge per millkwh consumed for each
year through the expiration of the agreement

item 13 certain relationships and related transactions

     heidtman contract for the years ended december 31 2003 and 2002 we sold
approximately 419000 tons and 451000 tons of our steel products to heidtman
for 1328 million and 1456 million representing approximately 13 and 17 of
our total net sales for each year respectively we have a longterm offtake
agreement with heidtman that extends through march 2007 under the offtake
agreement heidtman is obligated to buy and we are obligated to sell to
heidtman at least 76000 tons of our hot band products per quarter or 336000
tons annually and at least 15000 tons of our coldrolled products per quarter
or 60000 tons annually our pricing to heidtman is determined by either a
market or a spot market pricing formula for market priced sales of hotrolled
steel pricing is determined on an allin costplus basis together with all
published extras for spot market sales of hotrolled steel pricing is
determined on the basis of a discounted market index pricing for coldrolled
products is determined on a marginal revenue basis over hotrolled sheet john
bates is the president and chief executive officer of heidtman is a member of
our board of directors and is the beneficial owner of 6 of our common stock
outstanding as of december 31 2003

     omnisource contract since our inception we were able to ensure a stable
scrap supply for our flat roll and structural and rail divisions through a scrap
supply agreement with omnisource corporation however we have determined that
in the current scrap environment we would be better off with multiple available
sources of supply including the development of our own scrap purchasing
capability and with the flexibility to develop new relationships and supply
agreements with third parties and certain scrap generators accordingly we and
omnisource have amicably terminated our scrap supply agreement effective march
31 2004 we intend however to continue purchasing scrap from omnisource as
one of our major suppliers

     for the years ended december 31 2003 and 2002 we purchased 26 million
tons of scrap or 89 of our total scrap purchases and 21 million tons of
scrap or 82 of our total scrap purchases respectively from omnisource for
these purchasing services we paid omnisource fees of 28 million and 35
million for the years ended december 31 2003 and 2002 respectively daniel
rifkin who is a member of our board of directors is the president and chief
operating officer of omnisource and is also a stockholder of our company

     omni dynamic aviation llc during 2003 we increased our interest in omni
dynamic aviation which owns and operates a king air aircraft to 975 by
purchasing an interest previously held by omnisource for approximately 360000

     we believe that all of the transactions described above are on terms no
less favorable to us than could be obtained from unaffiliated third parties

our company

overview

      we are a steel manufacturing company that owns and operates steel
minimills we produce our steel principally from steel scrap using electric
arc melting furnaces continuous casting and automated rolling mills

      during 2002 our sales were approximately 864 million and at yearend
we had 869 employees none of our employees are represented by labor unions

      butler indiana flatroll mill

      we own and operate a flatroll minimill located in butler indiana which
produces sheet steel and which we built and have operated since 1996 this mill
has an annual production capacity of 22 million tons of flatrolled steel
although we actually produced 24 million tons during 2002 we produce a broad
range of high quality hotrolled coldrolled and coated steel products
including a large variety of high valueadded and high margin specialty products
such as thinner gauge rolled products and galvanized products we sell our
flatrolled products directly to endusers intermediate steel processors and
service centers primarily in the midwestern united states our products are used
in numerous industry sectors including the automotive construction and
commercial industries

      in may 2002 we announced plans to construct a new coating facility at our
butler minimill and we expect to complete this facility and to commence
coating operations in the middle of 2003 this 25 to 30 million facility will
have the capacity to coat approximately 240000 tons of steel which we plan to
provide through our butler mill

      in march 2003 we also purchased the assets of a coating facility formerly
owned by galvpro ii llc in jeffersonville indiana for a purchase price of
175 million plus a potential of an additional 15 million based on an
earnout formula we anticipate that this facility will be capable of producing
between 300000 and 350000 tons per year of lightgauge hotdipped coldrolled
galvanized steel we will operate this new facility as a part of our butler
indiana flat roll division which we expect will also supply the jeffersonville
plant with steel coils for coating we expect to invest between approximately 2
and 6 million of additional capital for certain equipment modifications and
upgrades to the facility and we anticipate that production will begin in
mid2003 our new jeffersonville facility together with our new coilcoating
facility in butler will enable us to further increase the mix of highermargin
valueadded downstream steel products this valueadded product mix during
2002 was approximately 60 of our total flatroll shipments

      columbia city indiana structural steel and rail mill

      we also own and operate a new structural steel and rail minimill in
columbia city indiana we began construction in may 2001 completed plant
construction in april 2002 and commenced commercial structural steel operations
during the third quarter of 2002 our columbia city minimill is designed to
have an annual production capacity of up to 13 million tons of structural steel
beams pilings and other steel components for the construction transportation
and industrial machinery markets as well as standard and premium grade rails
for the railroad industry through regular product introductions and continued
production rampup of structural steel products we have been able to begin to
offer a broad array of wide flange beams and hpiling structural steel products
during the first quarter of 2003 in addition we performed casting trials for
the production of standard rail products during the first quarter of 2003
expect to commence product trials during the second quarter of 2003 and plan to
begin shipping trial orders during the second half of 2003 these initial trial
orders will be used by railroad companies to be tested and monitored for product
qualification purposes this qualification process may take between six and nine
months

      pittsboro indiana bar mill

      on september 6 2002 we purchased the special bar quality minimill
assets in pittsboro indiana formerly owned by qualitech steel sbq llc we paid
45 million for these assets and currently plan to invest between 70 to 75
million of additional capital to upgrade and modify the pittsboro facility for
the production of angles flats rounds and other merchant bars and shapes as
well as reinforcing bar or rebar products we may also produce some special
bar quality products at this facility in the future after completion of the
necessary plant modifications as well as the issuance of the necessary
operational permits we expect to begin steel production in the first quarter of
2004 after modification we expect the pittsboro facility to have a capacity of
approximately 500000 to 600000 tons per year

      iron dynamics scrap substitute facility

      on february 24 2003 we announced plans to restart ironmaking operations
at our whollyowned iron dynamics facility adjacent to our butler indiana
minimill since 1997 we have tried to develop and commercialize a pioneering
process for the production of a virgin form of iron that could serve as a lower
cost substitute for a portion of the metallic raw material mix that goes into
our electric arc furnaces to be melted into new steel since initial startup in
august 1999 we encountered a number of equipment design and process
difficulties and on several occasions during 1999 and 2000 shut the facility
down for redesign reengineering and retrofitting in july 2001 we suspended
operations because of higher than expected startup and process refinement
costs high energy costs prevailing at that time low production quantities and
historically low steel scrap pricing existing at that time these factors made
the cost of producing and using our iron dynamics scrap substitute as a source
of metallics for the melt mix at our flatroll minimill higher than our cost of
purchasing and using steel scrap

      we continued to make refinements to our systems and processes and resumed
experimental production trials in the fourth quarter of 2002 after an
evaluation of these production trials we concluded that improved production
technology coupled with our new ability to recycle waste materials as a raw
material input and the current high price of scrap makes the restart of this
liquid pig iron production facility feasible we expect that the iron dynamics
operation will restart during the second half of 2003 and if the results of our
restart indicate that we will be able to produce liquid pig iron in sufficient
quantities and at a cost to be competitive with purchased pig iron we could
begin commercial production in late 2003 we also anticipate that the use of
this liquid pig iron raw material will provide cost and operational benefits to
our butler indiana steelmaking operations we expect to invest approximately
14 million of additional capital for modifications and refinements

      new millennium building systems

      on february 27 2003 we announced that we were increasing our ownership
in our consolidated new millennium building systems subsidiary from our existing
466 ownership interest to 100 through the acquisition of the 466 interest
in new millennium previously held by new process steel corporation a privately
held houston texas steel processor and our purchase of the remaining 68 stake
held by some of new millenniums managers we have consummated the 466 new
process acquisition at a cost of 35 million plus the purchase of new process
steels portion of new millenniums subordinated notes payable including
accrued interest for 39 million we plan to consummate the purchase of the
68 of minority interest shortly for a purchase price of 900000

      the new millennium facility which began production in june of 2000
produces steel building components including joists girders trusses and steel
roof and floor decking which we sell primarily in the upper midwest
nonresidential building components market our butler flatroll mill supplies a
majority of the hotrolled steel utilized in new millenniums manufacturing
operations

financing

      in march 2002 we consummated a 3500 million senior secured credit
agreement consisting of a five year 750 million revolving credit facility a
700 million term a loan with a term of five years which we prepaid in
december 2002 and a 2050 million term b loan with a term of six years of
which we prepaid 400 million this senior secured facility is secured by liens
and mortgages on substantially all of our personal and real property assets and
by liens and mortgages on substantially all of the personal and real property
assets of our whollyowned subsidiaries which have also guaranteed our
obligations under that facility

      also in march 2002 we issued 2000 million of 9 12 unsecured senior
notes due 2009

      during december 2002 and january 2003 we issued 1150 million of our 4
convertible subordinated notes due 2012 in an offering exempt from registration
under the securities act of 1933 pursuant to a registration rights agreement
between us and the initial purchasers of the notes who resold the notes in
offerings exempt from registration under rule 144a under the securities act we
filed a registration statement on form s3 on march 7 2003 to permit
registered resales by the selling securityholders of the notes and the
approximately 6762874 shares of common stock initially issuable upon
conversion of the notes approximately 1100 million of the net proceeds from
this offering were used to prepay our senior secured term a loan and 40 million

competitive strengths

      we believe that we have the following competitive strengths

      one of the lowest cost producers in the united states stateoftheart
      facilities

      we believe that our facilities are among the lowestcost steel
manufacturing facilities in the united states operating profit per ton at our
facilities was 65 23 and 74 in 2000 2001 and 2002 respectively which we
believe compares favorably with our competitors our low operating costs are
primarily a result of our efficient plant designs and operations our high
productivity rate of between 03 to 04 man hours per ton at our butler
minimill low ongoing maintenance cost requirements and strategic locations
near supplies of our primary raw material scrap steel

      experienced management team and unique corporate culture

      our senior management team is highly experienced and has a proven track
record in the steel industry including pioneering the development of thinslab
flatrolled technology their objectives are closely aligned with our
stockholders through meaningful stock ownership positions and incentive
compensation programs our corporate culture is also unique for the steel
industry we emphasize decentralized decisionmaking and have established
incentive compensation programs specifically designed to reward employee teams
for their efforts towards enhancing productivity improving profitability and
controlling costs

      diversified product mix

      our current products include hotrolled and coldrolled steel products
galvanized sheet products light gauge steel products structural steel and
rails and joists and deck materials we plan to broaden our offering of painted
and coated products when we commence production at our recently completed coil
coating facility in butler and at our recently acquired jeffersonville indiana
facility and we intend to enter the merchant bar market with an array of
angles flats rounds reinforcing bar and other shapes as well as some
possible special bar quality products when our newly acquired pittsboro
indiana bar mill becomes operational this diversified mix of products will
continue to allow us to access a broad range of enduser markets serve a broad
customer base and mitigate our exposure to cyclical downturns in any one product
or enduser market

      strategic geographic locations

      the strategic locations of our facilities near sources of scrap materials
and our customer base allow us to realize significant pricing advantages due to
freight savings for inbound scrap as well as for outbound steel products
destined for our customers our minimills are located in the upper midwest a
region which we believe accounts for a majority of the total scrap produced in
the united states our new jeffersonville indiana galvanizing facility on the
ohio river will also provide us with expanded geographic reach to southern
markets

business strategy

      expand product offerings

      the completion of our columbia city minimill and the commencement of
production of structural steel and rails at that facility the completion of our
butler coil coating facility and the expansion of production of coated products
as a result of that facility as well as our recent acquisitions of the
pittsboro indiana bar mill and the jeffersonville indiana galvanizing
facility are important steps in pursuing our strategy of product line
expansion the columbia city structural steel and rail mill is strategically
located to serve the upper midwest northeast and canadian markets which we
believe are attractive and underserved markets our strategy to expand our
flatrolled steel product offerings is to focus on the production of high
valueadded thinner gauge products galvanized products and various coated
products the margins on high valueadded products typically exceed those of the
commodity grade and the number of producers that make them is more limited our
pittsboro indiana bar mill is likewise strategically located to position
ourselves to costeffectively serve our product markets we will continue to
seek additional opportunities to further expand our range of high valueadded
products through the expansion of existing facilities greenfield projects and
acquisitions of other steel manufacturers or steelmaking assets that may become
available through the continuing consolidation of the domestic steel industry

      enter new geographic markets

      we may seek to enter new steel markets in strategic geographic locations
such as the southeastern or western united states that offer attractive growth
opportunities due to the ongoing restructuring of the domestic steel industry
we believe there are attractive opportunities to grow our business
geographically either through acquisitions of existing assets or through
strategic partnerships and alliances we may also consider growth opportunities
through greenfield projects such as our columbia city structural steel and rail
mill

      continue to maintain low production costs

      we are focused on continuing to maintain one of the lowest operating cost
structures in the north american steel industry based upon operating cost per
ton we will continue to optimize the use of our equipment enhance our
productivity and explore new technologies to further improve our unit cost of
production at each of our facilities

      foster entrepreneurial culture

      we intend to continue to foster our entrepreneurial corporate culture and
emphasize decentralized decisionmaking while rewarding teamwork innovation
and operating efficiency we will also continue to focus on maintaining the
effectiveness of our incentive bonusbased plans that are designed to enhance
overall productivity and align the interests of our management and employees
with our stockholders

our operations

      butler flatroll minimill

      our butler flatroll steel minimill manufactures hotrolled coldrolled
and coated steel products it currently has an annual capacity of 22 million
tons although during 2002 we actually produced approximately 24 million tons
we commenced construction of our butler minimill in october 1994 and began
production of commercial quality steel in january 1996 with an initial annual
capacity of 14 million tons at the end of 1997 we completed construction of a
cold finishing mill contiguous to our butler hot mill with an annual capacity of
10 million tons in july 1998 we completed construction installation and
startup of a second twinshell melting furnace battery thinslab caster
tunnel furnace and coiler thus increasing our minimills annual production
capacity to its current level of 22 million tons this additional production
capacity of hotrolled steel also enables us to take full advantage of the 10
million ton rolling and finishing capacity of our cold mill our products are
characterized by high quality surface characteristics precise tolerances and
light gauge in addition our butler minimill was one of the first us
flatroll minimills to achieve iso 9002 and qs 9000 certifications we believe
that these certifications have enabled us to serve a broader range of customers
and endusers which historically have been almost exclusively served by
integrated steel producers

      the hot mill

      our hotrolled minimills electric arc furnace melting process begins
with the charging of a furnace vessel with scrap steel carbon and lime or with
a combination of scrap and a scrap substitute or alternative iron product the
furnace vessels top is swung into place electrodes are lowered into the
furnace vessel through holes in the top of the furnace and electricity is
applied to melt the scrap the liquid pig iron or hot briquetted iron that we
expect our iron dynamics subsidiary to begin producing toward the end of 2003
are examples of scrap substitutes that would be introduced directly into the
melt mix at this stage

      we have two fuchs twinshell electric arc melting furnaces designed to
substantially reduce both poweroff time and taptotap time the length of time
between successive melting cycles or heats when melting is being done in one
vessel we can tap the other vessel and refill it with scrap and steel scrap
substitute to make it ready for the next melt this results in more heats and
greater productivity per shift an additional advantage of our twinshell design
is that if there is a maintenance problem requiring work on one vessel melting
can proceed in the other vessel without interruption

      after exiting the furnaces the liquid steel is transported in a ladle by
overhead crane to an area commonly known as the ladle metallurgy station at
each metallurgy station the steel is kept in a molten state while metallurgical
testing refining alloying and desulfurizing takes place we have three
separate ladle metallurgy stations consisting of three furnaces and two
desulfurization stations having a separate metallurgy station apart from the
furnaces allows us to maximize the time that the furnaces can be used for
melting scrap


                                       6
page
      the liquid steel is then transported to one of our two continuous
thinslab casters where it is emptied into a tundish or reservoir this
reservoir controls the flow of the liquid steel into a watercooled copperlined
mold from which it then exits as an externally solid slab our casters were
built by sms schloemannsiemag ag we have also designed a special nozzle which
transfers the liquid steel from the reservoir into the mold that results in
increased productivity and product quality the slab from the continuous caster
is less than twoinches thick and proceeds directly into one of our two tunnel
furnaces the tunnel furnaces maintain and equalize the slabs temperature the
slab leaves the tunnel furnace and is descaled to remove surface scale prior to
its rolling

      in the hotrolling operation the slab is progressively reduced in
thickness our hotrolling mill consists of a sevenstand rolling mill built by
sms schloemannsiemag ag the mill is equipped with the latest electronic and
hydraulic controls to control such things as gauge shape profile and exit
speeds of the steel strip as it moves along the runout table to help prevent
thinner steel strip from cobbling the seventh rolling stand which we added
allows us to further roll our sheet steel to even thinner gauges down to 10
mm with excellent surface quality and enables us to access markets previously
available only to more costly cold finished material

      after exiting the hotrolling mill the rolled sheet steel is cooled and
wound into coils the coil form allows the strip to be easily handled and
transported we sell a portion of our hot band coil production directly to
endusers or to intermediate steel processors or service centers where they may
be pickled coldrolled annealed tempered or galvanized the rest of our hot
band coil production is directed to our cold mill where we add value to this
product through our own pickling coldrolling annealing tempering or
galvanizing processes including the additional coating capacity provided by our
recently completed paint line we will also supply our new jeffersonville
indiana galvanizing facility with material

      throughout the hotrolling process laser optical measuring equipment and
multiple xray devices measure all strip dimensions allowing adjustments to
occur continuously and providing feedback information to the mill process
controls and computers the entire production process is monitored and
controlled by both business and process computers production schedules are
created based on order input information and transmitted to the mill computers
by the plant business system as the material is processed operating and
quality data are gathered and stored for analysis of operating performance and
for documentation of product parameters to the customer the system then
coordinates and monitors the shipping process and prints all relevant paper work
for shipping when the coil leaves the plant

      the cold mill

      our cold mill is located adjacent to our hot mill and produces products
that require gauges properties or surfaces that cannot be achieved in our hot
mill coldrolled sheet is hotrolled sheet that has been further processed
through a continuous pickle line and then successively passed through a rolling
mill without reheating until the desired gauge and other physical properties
have been achieved coldrolling reduces gauge hardens the steel and when
further processed through an annealing furnace and temper mill improves
uniformity ductility and formability coldrolling can also add a variety of
finishes and textures to the surface of the steel

      our coldrolled mill process begins with hotrolled product from our
hotrolling mill entering our continuous pickle line at the entry end of the
continuous pickle line we have two reels to unwind coils and a welder to join
the coils together we unwind the coils on alternate reels and attach them end
to end by the welder creating a continuous strip through the pickle tanks the
center section of the 700foot pickle line consists of a scale breakertension
leveler pickling tanks where the strip moves through a bath of hydrochloric
acid that thoroughly cleans the strip in preparation for galvanizing and rolling
operations and rinse tanks at the delivery end of the line there is a reel for
recoiling the pickled product after recoiling each coil is stored in a central
coil storage area the design of the continuous pickle line allows for the
production of a wide combination of gauges and widths on the light gauge steel
supplied by the hot mill

      from the central coil storage area we move our coils in one of three
directions we can 1 ship pickled and oiled coils directly to customers from
the continuous pickle line as finished product 2 immediately galvanize some
coils on the hotrolled galvanizing line which is then sold as finished product
or 3 process coils through our coldreversing mill

      pickled and oiled coils that are not intended for immediate shipment or
hotrolled galvanizing are processed in our cold reversing mill our cold
reversing mill was built by sms schloemannsiemag ag and is one of only two
semitandem twostand reversing coldrolling operations in the world this
configuration provides considerably higher throughput than a conventional
singlestand reversing mill yet also takes advantage of considerably lower
equipment costs than the conventional four to sixstand tandem coldrolling
mill the rolling mill is configured with multiple xray gauges hydraulic
bending systems rolling solution controls gauge controls and strip flatness
controls used to produce an extremely high level of product quality parameters
the coldrolling mill also uses a process control computer using sophisticated
mathematical models to optimize both quality and throughput


                                       7
page
      product that exits the cold reversing mill can then be shipped as finished
product transported to our coldrolled galvanizing line or transported to our
batch annealing furnaces in the coldrolled galvanizing line coldrolled coils
are heated in an annealing furnace and coated while still hot in a pot of molten
zinc as the coil leaves the pot various coating controls ensure that the
product matches the customers requirements the coils are then shipped as
finished product the coldrolled galvanizing line and the hotrolled
galvanizing line are very similar but the coldrolled galvanizing line has a
more elaborate and larger strip heating furnace that is required to anneal
coldrolled product we designed our continuous pickle line and the two
galvanizing lines concurrently and procured the equipment from the same
manufacturer as a result the equipment of our three lines share a commonality
of parts and we have been able to realize a high degree of flexibility and cost
savings in the management of our spare parts

      coldrolled coils that do not require galvanizing proceed to our batch
annealing furnaces the batch annealing furnaces heat and then cool the coils in
a controlled manner to reduce the hardness of the steel that is created in the
coldrolling process the batch annealing furnaces heat the steel in a hydrogen
environment that optimizes the efficiency of the heating process and produces a
product that is superior to conventional batch annealing with regard to
cleanliness and uniform metallurgical characteristics computer models determine
and control the heating and cooling the coils based on current knowledge of heat
transfers and steel characteristics

      coils from the annealing furnaces are then temperrolled and shipped as
finished product the temper mill consists of a single stand fourhigh rolling
mill designed for relatively light reduction of the product the temper mill
introduces a small amount of hardness into the product and further enhances the
overall flatness and surface quality of the product the temper mill also has an
xray gauge to monitor strip thickness this mill was purchased concurrently
with the twostand coldrolling mill from sms schloemannsiemag ag enabling us
to realize a high degree of flexibility and cost savings with regard to
management of spare parts

      as with our hot mill our cold mill is linked by means of business and
process computers we expanded our computer systems to comprehend order entry of
the additional cold mill products and we accomplish all of our line scheduling
in the computer systems through schedules transmitted to the appropriate process
related computers we collect operating and quality data for analysis and
quality control purposes and for reporting product data to customers

      our new onsite coating facility

      our new 25 to 30 million onsite paint line expansion located
immediately adjacent to our existing cold mill building will be completed in
august 2003 and will have a coating capacity of 240000 tons per year in gauges
from 010 to 070 inches and in widths ranging from 36 to 64 inches the paint
line will receive material directly from our other processing lines and will be
capable of painting hot rolled galvanized coil cold rolled coil and cold rolled
galvanized coil the line incorporates stateoftheart coil coating equipment
with quick color change capability inline tension leveling direct heat
catenary ovens and a thermal recuperative oxidizer

      we believe that we will be the only mill in north america with an onsite
paint line which should not only enable us to realize substantial savings in
overhead maintenance engineering sales and marketing capital cost and
infrastructure but will eliminate the typical cost of transfer freight
approximately 1015 per ton that a customer must otherwise pay to transport
coils to other remote coating facilities these advantages will further enable
us to continue to be a low cost supplier of coated products the addition of our
new paint line further expands our high margin value added product offerings as
we previously sent approximately 10000 tons per month of our product to other
companies for coating

      our new jeffersonville indiana galvanizing facility

      our new jeffersonville indiana cold rolled galvanizing facility which we
purchased in march 2003 from galvpro ii llc for 175 million plus up to an
additional 15 million based on an earnout formula is located within the
clark maritime center on the ohio river the galvanizing line has a capacity of
between 300000 and 350000 tons per year and is capable of coating cold rolled
steel in gauges from 008 to 045 inches and in widths between 24 and 60 inches
this gauge range is lighter than that available from our butler facility and
will therefore create a further expansion of our value added product
offerings particularly in the light gauge building products arena

      the galvanizing line was built in 1999 has been well maintained and is
almost identical to the cold rolled galvanizing line at our butler mill this
familiarity will help us facilitate a rapid startup once we complete our
previously announced equipment modifications and upgrades to the facility at a
cost of between 2 and 6 million and we anticipate that production will be

      columbia city structural steel and rail minimill

      we began construction of our new structural steel and rail minimill in
columbia city indiana in may 2001 completed plant construction in april 2002
and commenced commercial structural steel operations during the third quarter of
2002 our columbia city minimill is designed to have an annual production
capacity of up to 13 million tons of structural steel beams pilings and other
steel components for the construction transportation and industrial machinery
markets as well as standard and premium grade rails for the railroad industry
through regular product introductions and continued production rampup of
structural steel products we have been able to continuously broaden our
complement of wide flange beams and hpiling structural steel products through
the first quarter of 2003 in addition we expect to begin production of
standard rail products during the second quarter of 2003 initial rail
production will be used in a testing capacity to be monitored by individual
railroad companies for product qualification purposes this qualification
process may take between six and nine months we spent approximately 315
million excluding capitalized interest costs on this facility

      mill operation

      our structural steel and rail minimill melts scrap and scrap substitutes
in an electric arc furnace much the same way as in our flatroll minimill we
use a single shell furnace but have purchased and installed a second furnace
which provides us with backup melting capability in case of a furnace breakdown
or during one of our periodic maintenance outages at present our operating
permit only enables us to use one furnace at a time while we plan to use 100
scrap as the primary raw material the system is also configured to accept
liquid pig iron should we eventually determine that it is cost effective to
place an iron dynamics module at the columbia city plant site the furnace was
built by sms demag ag and includes features that permit us to employ more
thermally efficient melting practices the furnace features a removable shell
that enables us to do offline repair and refractory relining comes equipped
with a unique quickchange roof configuration and also features a fast tap hole
tube change configuration that shortens the time required for periodic
replacement

      from the furnace the molten metal is transported to a separate ladle
metallurgy furnace where as in the flatroll minimill we adjust the mix for
temperature and chemistry we then take the liquid steel to a continuous caster
where unlike our butler minimill that produces a single strand of flat stock
our structural steel caster casts three strands expandable to four of blooms
and beam blanks the caster utilizes a curved mold that produces five sizes of
materialone bloom which is rectangular shaped and four beam blanks which
are dog bone shaped in varying lengths of 1748 feet the caster design
accommodates a quickchange tundish nozzle system designed to optimize the
continuous casting process and to achieve a low operational cost per ton the
tundish bottoms are also designed to change from a bloom opening to any of four
beam blank sizes to allow greater flexibility in product choice the caster was
built by sms concast

      after exiting the mold the multiple strands continue through a series of
sprays and roller supports to precisely cool and contain the cast shapes
straightener rolls then unbend the curved strands onto a horizontal passline
where they are cut to length by automatic torches we then weigh the cast pieces
and transport them either directly through a reheat furnace built by ac
leadbetter to a hotrolling mill or into a storage area for rolling at a later
time in the hotrolling mill the product passes through a breakdown stand
where it is rolled into either a structural steel product or a rail product
depending on the rollconfiguration and number of passes the product is then
transferred to a 3stand tandem mill which consists of a universal rougher an
edger and a universal finisher the hotrolling mill is an advanced fourstand
all reversing mill built by sms demag ag the minimill is capable of producing
wide flange beams from 6 x 4 to 36 x 12 standard beams piling sections
mshape sections sheet piling channels car building shapes bulb angles and
zees and rail sections

      downstream of the hotrolling mill a hot saw cuts the structural steel to
a maximum 246foot length before it enters a cooling bed after cooling the
structural steel product is straightened on a roller straightener and cut to
length as required by a particular order the product is then piled and bundled
and shipped as finished product

      for the production of rail products we have fitted our caster with new
molds and segments to cast the new 13 x 10 blooms required for rail
production we have also added electro magnetic stirring within the caster to
improve surface quality and reduce internal cracking the reheat furnace which
heats the blooms to the proper rolling temperature is also fitted with
automation changes for the charging and discharging machines we also operate
additional descaling equipment prior to the rolling process as well as a rail
stamper and manipulator both vertical and horizontal straighteners are used to
produce a rail that is true along all axes after straightening the rail
product is tested cut to length and drilled in our testing center we provide
ultrasonic testing for the detection of internal defects an eddy current
machine to spot surface cracks a profile gauge for dimensional accuracy and a
straightnesswaviness measurement machine we are also in the process of
installing additional cooling and

handling equipment to manufacture highly desirable 320foot rail lengths which
no one else produces in or imports into the us or canadian rail markets

      iron dynamics steel scrap substitute facility

      since 1997 iron dynamics has tried to develop and commercialize a
pioneering process of producing a virgin form of iron that might serve as a
lower cost substitute for a portion of the metallic raw material mix that goes
into our electric arc furnaces to be melted into new steel historically the
price of steel scrap as a commodity has tended to be volatile rising and
falling with supply and demand and not always in lock step with or in proportion
to the market price of new steel therefore having a lower cost alternative
source of virgin iron for a portion of a minimills melt mix if realizable
would partially buffer some of the effects of scrap price volatility with the
growing proportion of electric furnace steelmaking both worldwide and
domestically we believe that the benefits of developing a costeffective
alternate iron source to augment scrap our primary raw material makes good
economic sense in the long run

      we initially funded our iron dynamics subsidiary with a 30 million equity
investment iron dynamics also secured a 65 million bank credit facility iron
dynamics established a plant site contiguous to and partially within our butler
indiana plant campus and in october 1997 began construction of a facility for
the production of direct reduced iron and liquid pig iron

      direct reduced iron is a metallic product made from iron ore or iron ore
fines that have been treated in a direct reduction furnace such as a rotary
hearth furnace with either natural gas or coal to reduce the iron oxide to
metallic iron the method selected by iron dynamics is one that uses coal as the
reducing agent liquid pig iron the ultimate end product intended to be
produced by iron dynamics is a pure metal product produced by smelting the
direct reduced iron in a submerged arc furnace our iron dynamics facility was
designed and built for the production of direct reduced iron and its conversion
into liquid pig iron we planned to use all of iron dynamics liquid pig iron in
our own steelmaking operations at butler

      the plant commenced initial startup in august 1999 during this
preliminary startup however we encountered a number of equipment and design
deficiencies which required iron dynamics to undertake some costly and
timeconsuming redesign reengineering and equipment replacement work and to
operate this new facility at greatly reduced output levels a design and
retrofit program began in late 1999 and continued throughout 2000 in july 2000
iron dynamics suspended operations to effect certain preplanned repairs
including the installation of a new submerged arc furnace and a number of
additional capital projects including the installation of two hot briquetters
a new offgas system for the submerged arc furnace a sludge reclamation system
and a hot pan conveyance system in march 2001 iron dynamics restarted the
facility however in july 2001 we suspended operations because of higher than
expected startup and process refinement costs then high prevailing energy
costs low production quantities and historically low steel scrap pricing at
that time these factors made the cost of producing and using iron dynamics
scrap substitute product at our flatroll minimill higher than the cost of
purchasing and using steel scrap

      we continued to make refinements to our systems and processes
notwithstanding the shutdown and began experimental production trials again
during the fourth quarter of 2002 after an evaluation of these production
trials we concluded that the improved production technology coupled with our
ability to recycle waste materials as part of our raw material mix and the
current high price of scrap makes the restart and operation of this liquid pig
iron production facility feasible accordingly on february 24 2003 we
announced that we plan to restart ironmaking operations at iron dynamics and
currently expect that the iron dynamics facility will restart during the second
half of 2003 if the results of our restart indicate that we will be able to
produce liquid pig iron in sufficient quantities and at a cost to be competitive
with purchased pig iron we could begin commercial production in late 2003 we
also anticipate that the use of this liquid pig iron raw material will produce
cost and operational benefits for our butler indiana steelmaking operations we
expect to invest an additional 14 million into further modifications and
refinements including the installation of three additional briquetting machines
in the facility which will enable us to stockpile iron briquettes after
reduction in the rotary hearth furnace as well as to introduce the hot
briquettes directly into our submerged arc furnace if we wish to do so after
the briquettes are liquefied the hot liquid pig iron will be transferred in
ladles to the flatroll mills meltshop and combined with scrap steel in the
mills electric arc furnaces

      as of december 31 2002 our equity investment in the iron dynamics
project was 160 million

      our pittsboro indiana bar mill

      we purchased our pittsboro indiana bar minimill from qualitech steel sbq
llc in september 2002 and we are planning to upgrade and retrofit the mill so
that it will be capable of producing a broad array of merchant bars and shapes
and reinforcing bar products as well special bar quality or sbq products the
mill was originally constructed in 1997 as an sbq mill and consists generally of
a 100 ton single shell ac melting furnace by sms demag a three strand sms demag
continuous caster capable of casting both a 7 x 7 billet and a 14 x 10
bloom a reheat furnace and a rolling mill consisting of a pomini roughing

mill and intermediate mill and kocks reducing and sizing blocks used in the
production of sbq rounds the meltshop is also equipped with a separate ladle
metallurgy facility or lmf where metallurgical testing refining alloying and
desulfurizing takes place and a vacuum tank degasser which is used to degas
steel to produce ultra low carbon and ultra high purity products

      we are currently reviewing proposals for the addition of an eight stand
finishing mill together with ancillary equipment such as abrasive saws shears
a straightener and magnetic stacking equipment which will enable us to produce
merchant bars and shapes as well as reinforcing bar products

      after completion of the necessary plant modifications and the issuance of
the necessary operating permits we anticipate that steel production will
commence during the first quarter of 2004 we expect that the pittsboro facility
will have a capacity of approximately 500000 to 600000 tons per year

      new millennium facility

      in february 2003 we increased our ownership percentage in our
consolidated new millennium building systems subsidiary from our preexisting
466 ownership interest to 932 through our acquisition of the 466 interest
in new millennium previously held by new process steel corporation a privately
held houston texas steel processor we also announced that we are acquiring the
remaining 68 stake currently owned by certain new millennium management
employees and consummated this remaining purchase during the first quarter of
2003 after completion of the final purchase and including our original
investment we will have invested approximately 13 million in our new
millennium subsidiary

      new millennium produces steel building components for the construction
industry including joists girders trusses and steel roof and floor decking
these products are sold primarily in the upper midwest nonresidential building
components market our butler flatroll mill supplies a majority of the
hotrolled steel utilized in new millenniums manufacturing operations

      new millennium began construction of its butler indiana facility in
december 1999 and substantially completed it in the second quarter of 2000 at a
total capital cost of approximately 23 million

products and customers

      butler flatroll minimill

      products our butler minimill produces hotrolled products that include a
variety of high quality mild and medium carbon and high strength low alloy
hotrolled bands in 40 inch to 62 inch widths and in thicknesses from 500 inch
down to 080 inch we also produce an array of lighter gauge hotrolled
products ranging in thickness from 080 inch and thinner including high
strength low alloy 80000 minimum yield and medium carbon steels made possible
by the addition of our seventh hotrolling stand these products are suitable
for automobile truck trailer and recreational vehicle parts and components
mechanical and structural steel tubing gas and fluid transmission piping metal
building systems rail cars ships barges and other marine equipment
agricultural equipment and farm implements lawn garden and recreation
equipment industrial machinery and shipping containers

      we believe that our basic production hot band material has shape
characteristics that exceed those of the other thinslab flatroll minimills
and compares favorably with those of the integrated mills in addition as a
result of our lighter gauge hotrolling capabilities we are now able to produce
hotrolled hotdipped galvanized and galvannealed steel products these products
are capable of replacing products that have traditionally only been available as
more costly coldrolled galvanized or coldrolled galvannealed steel during
2001 and 2002 we produced 751000 tons and 849000 tons of these lighter gauge
hotrolled products respectively our new jeffersonville indiana galvanizing
facility will also further enable us to add to our mix of higher margin value
added products through our ability to coat additional material that would
otherwise not be coated due to the galvanizing capacity limitations at our
butler mill during 2002 approximately 60 of our flatroll shipments consisted
of valueadded products

      in our cold mill we also produce hotrolled pickled and oiled hotrolled
hot dipped galvanized hotrolled galvannealed coldrolled hot dipped
galvanized coldrolled galvannealed and fully processed coldrolled sheet our
new paint line will paint hot rolled galvanized coil cold rolled coil and cold
rolled galvanized coil in gauges from 010 to 070 inches and widths ranging
from 36 inches to 64 inches this material will typically be used in
transportation products building products such as raised garage door panels
heating and cooling products appliances furniture and lighting equipment

      during 2002 we sold our products to approximately 170 customers in 2002
our largest customers were heidtman worthington steel and straightline which
in the aggregate accounted for approximately 32 of our total net sales
heidtman accounted individually for approximately 21 18 and 17 of our net
sales in 2000 2001 and 2002 respectively

      steel processors and service centers typically act as intermediaries
between primary steel producers such as us and the many enduser manufacturers
that require further processing of hot bands the additional processing
performed by the intermediate steel processors and service centers include
pickling galvanizing cutting to length slitting to size leveling blanking
shape correcting edge rolling shearing and stamping notwithstanding the
completion of our cold mill and our increased utilization in our own cold
finishing facility for a considerable portion of our hot band production we
expect that our intermediate steel processor and service center customers will
remain an integral part of our customer base our sales outside the continental
united states accounted for approximately 1 of our total net sales in 2002

majority of our structural steel products will be sold to service centers

      the marketplace for steel rails in the united states and canada is
relatively small approximately 800000 tons in 2001 and is also specialized
with only approximately six class 1 railroad purchasers burlington
northernsanta fe union pacific canadian pacific railway norfolk southern
csx transportation and canadian national railway these purchasers account for
approximately 600000 tons of annual production rail contractors transit
districts and shortline railroads purchase the rest of the rail products

      we intend to produce rail in standard and premium or headhardened grades
in a range of weights from 115 lbs per yard to 141 lbs per yard in lengths
from the traditional 80 feet up to 240 feet initially and ultimately to 320
feet we also intend to weld these 240320 foot rails into 1600 foot strings
for delivery to the installation site such long strings offer substantial
savings both in terms of initial capital cost and through reduced maintenance
in contrast current production of rail in the united states and available
imported rail is limited to 80foot lengths as a result of existing plant
layout restrictions and the physical limitations of ocean freight the more
welded joints there are in a mile of track the greater the maintenance cost to
the railroad due to excessive wear and fatigue cracking at the welds

      columbia city structural steel and rail minimill

      sales of structural steel products are sensitive to the level of
construction activity which is in turn affected by such cyclical factors as
general economic conditions interest rates inflation consumer spending and
employment

      our structural steel products compete with a sizable number of electric
arc furnace structural steelmakers some of which have cost structures and
flexible management cultures similar to our own notable competitors include
nucor steel in berkeley south carolina nucoryamato steel in blytheville

there are also a number of smaller competitors including ameristeel in
cartersville georgia bayou steel in laplace louisiana and jl structural
steel in aliquippa pennsylvania the nucor minimills and the txichaparral
minimills accounted for over 89 of the tons produced in north america in 2001
we also believe however that both geography and product choice will play
significant roles there are currently no other structural mills located in the
midwest one of the largest structural steel consuming regions in the united
states and we believe we will be able to provide freightsaving and customer
service benefits to end users service centers and fabricators located in the
region we also believe that most of canadas structural steel consumption is
located in canadas eastern provinces closer to us than to either of our two
largest competitors moreover we intend to provide a broad product mix
focusing on the midrange and larger section served only by nucoryamato steel
and txichaparral from locations more remote than our minimill

      at present the rail market is principally served by two producers rocky
mountain steel a division of oregon steel mills inc in pueblo colorado and
pennsylvania steel technologies a subsidiary of bethlehem steel corporation in
steelton pennsylvania each of these producers has the capability to produce
either standard or premium rail although neither is equipped to produce rail in

sources and availability of scrap and scrap substitute

      our principal raw material is scrap metal derived from among other
sources junked automobiles industrial scrap railroad cars and railroad track
materials agricultural machinery and demolition scrap from obsolete structures
containers and machines

      scrap

      scrap is the single most important raw material used in our steelmaking
process the percentage of scrap used in our steelmaking operations may decline
somewhat in future years depending upon the proportion of scrap substitute
products that may be used from time to time

      as it relates to final product quality electric arc furnace steel
producers such as we can normally only tolerate a maximum 2 level of
residual materials such as nonferrous metallic contamination from copper
nickel tin chromium and molybdenum which once having been dissolved into
steel cannot be refined out in order for the scrap melt to provide this level
of quality under present circumstances the mill must use approximately 60 of
low residual scrap or an equivalent material such low residual scrap
generally takes the form of no 1 dealer bundles no 1 factory bundles
busheling and clips we may then use various grades of higher residual and
thus less expensive scrap which can be blended with low residual scrap to keep
within impurity tolerances

      many variables impact scrap prices the most critical of which is us
steel production generally as steel demand increases so does scrap demand and
resulting scrap prices the reverse is also normally but not always true with
scrap prices following steel prices downward where supply exceeds demand during
late 2000 the flood of imported steel much of it unfairly traded resulted in
sharply reduced new steel production with corresponding decreases in the need
for and thus the price of scrap this corresponding decrease in the price of
scrap mitigated somewhat the impact of sharply declining prices for new steel
products during 2000 and 2001 and enabled us to maintain some modest profit
margins despite the severe market dislocation the precipitous decline in scrap
prices in 1999 and 2000 however caused dealers to retain their inventories and
to withhold them from sale thus causing some shortterm supply shortages even
in the face of a supplydemand inversion at the consumer levels on the other
hand during the latter part of 2002 and continuing during the first quarter of
2003 the price of scrap has risen sharply upward largely as a result of
foreign scrap demand particularly from china

      we believe that the demand for low residual scrap will rise more rapidly
than the supply in the coming years especially with the increased number of
electric arc furnace minimills both here and abroad that have been built or
commenced operations in recent years as a result in order to maintain an
available supply of scrap at competitive market prices we seek to maintain a
strong and dependable source through which to purchase scrap of all grades
including low residual scrap and have also been attempting to develop our own
captive scrap substitutes supply

      since our inception we have been able to ensure a stable scrap supply for
our butler minimill through a reliable scrap supply agreement with omnisource
corporation one of the largest suppliers of scrap in the nation in august we
entered into a new agreement with omnisource effective as of july 1 2002
which extends through december 31 2004 either party may terminate the contract
at anytime on or after july 1 2003 provided that the terminating party gives
at least three full calendar months prior notice to the other party our new
scrap supply agreement extends as well to our columbia city and pittsboro
facilities

      scrap substitutes

      direct reduced iron hot briquetted iron and pig iron can substitute for a
limited portion of the steel scrap used in electric furnace minimill steel
production historically we have used a relatively small percentage of scrap
substitutes in our melt mix generally we use approximately 15 by weight of
scrap substitutes in our melt mix mainly solid and generally imported pig iron
during 2002 we consumed approximately 417000 tons of solid pig iron of the
28 million tons of metallics that we used we also bought minimal quantities of
direct reduced iron and hot briquetted iron all of these scrap substitute
purchases were made on the spot market at prevailing market prices

      we anticipate that if the results of our planned restart of hot briquetted
iron and liquid pig iron production at our butler indiana iron dynamics
subsidiary is successful we will begin utilizing all of iron dynamics scrap
substitute product output which at full production we estimate to be
approximately 30000 tonnes of liquid pig iron per year in our butler indiana
steelmaking operations

our industry

overview

      the us steel industry has historically been and continues to be highly
cyclical in nature influenced by a combination of factors including periods of
economic growth or recession strength or weakness of the us dollar worldwide
production capacity and levels of steel imports and applicable tariffs the
steel industry has also been affected by various companyspecific factors such
as a companys ability or inability to adapt to technological change plant
inefficiency and high labor costs

      during the second half of 2000 and throughout 2001 the us steel
industry experienced a severe downward cycle largely as a result of increased
imports of steel at depressed prices weak economic conditions and excess global
steel production capacity on the other hand during the first half of 2002
domestic flatrolled steel prices increased dramatically from historical
cyclical lows in 2001 this increase resulted from a number of factors
including 1 a temporary reduction in domestic steel production capacity as a
result of certain bankruptcies and shutdowns of other us steel producers 2
a reduction in imports driven in part by certain favorable rulings and
executive actions with respect to tariffs and quotas on foreign steel and 3 a
brief strengthening of the overall us economy and the need for endusers of
steel products to replenish their depleted inventories the cycle began to turn
downward again toward the end of 2002 however largely as a result of softening
product demand brought about by a still weak economy and war concerns and steel
pricing has continued to fall during the first quarter of 2003

      the us steel industry experienced further change during 2002 as a result
of consolidation international steel group added to its acquisition of the
bankrupt steel assets of ltv steel with its acquisition of acme steels assets
and its planned acquisition of the assets of bethlehem steel all three of these
acquisitions resulted from the prior bankruptcies of the predecessor steel
companies similarly us steel has announced its planned acquisition of the
bankrupt assets of national steel these and similar developments are causing
formerly idled or inefficient production facilities to come back into the market
with substantially lower capital costs with lower renegotiated labor costs and
shorn of many previously burdensome health care and retirement legacy costs and
other liabilities the result of this consolidation which we expect to
continue is a more competitive and more price sensitive us steel market with
a narrowing of production cost differentials between minimills and some of
these integrated producers moreover other us steel producers of the
approximately thirty that entered bankruptcy since 1997 may emerge from
bankruptcy and continue to operate after reorganization with lower cost
structures

antidumping initiatives

      us steel producers compete with many foreign producers competition from
foreign producers is typically strong but is also substantially affected by the
relative strength of foreign economies and fluctuation in the value of the us
dollar against foreign currencies with steel imports tending to increase when
the value of the dollar is strong in relation to foreign currencies the
situation has been exacerbated by reason of a weakening of certain economies
particularly in eastern europe asia and latin america because of the
ownership control or subsidization of some foreign steel producers by their
governments decisions by such producers with respect to their production sales
and pricing decisions are often influenced to a greater degree by political and
economic policy consideration than by prevailing market conditions realities of
the marketplace or consideration of profit or loss since 1998 when imports of
hotrolled and coldrolled products increased 43 compared to the prior year
domestic steel producers including us have been adversely affected by
illegally dumped imported steel dumping involves selling a product below cost
or for less than in the exporters home country and is a violation of us trade
laws most foreign markets are less open than the us market allowing foreign
producers to maintain higher prices in their own markets while dumping excess
production at lower and often subsidized prices into the us market a number
of steel industry antidumping initiatives or trade cases have been brought in
recent years in an attempt to stem the flow of these unlawful imports some have
been successful and some have not

      hotrolled sheet

      in september 1998 eleven us steel companies including us as well as
two labor unions filed antidumping complaints with the itc and the us
department of commerce against hotrolled coiled steel imports from japan
russia and brazil seeking determinations that those three countries were
dumping hotrolled carbon steel in the us market at below fair market prices
the group also filed a subsidy or countervailing duty complaint against
brazil

      in april 1999 the department of commerce issued a final determination
that imports of hotrolled steel from japan were dumped at margins ranging from
17 to 65 and in june 1999 the itc reached a final determination that imports
of hotrolled sheet from japan caused injury to the us steel industry as a
consequence the department of commerce issued an antidumping order against
imports from japan


                                       16
page
      in july 1999 the department of commerce also issued suspension agreements
and final antidumping duty determinations as to imports of hotrolled sheet
from brazil and russia suspension agreements generally impose price andor
quantity restrictions on imports from the subject country for the purpose of
removing the injurious impact of the dumping or subsidies and are often
negotiated with the subject country either in lieu of the imposition of
antidumping or countervailing duties or as an alternate remedy to suspend a
previously imposed duty in february 2002 the department of commerce having
found violations of the suspension agreement by brazilian producers revoked the
agreement and reimposed dumping duties of 48

      while we and the us steel industry benefited from these rulings with
hotrolled sheet imports from these three countries which accounted for
approximately 70 of 1998s hotrolled import tonnage declining by
approximately 90 the benefit was significantly thwarted by the shifting of
imports to hotrolled sheet from countries other than japan russia and brazil
which increased significantly during 2000 therefore in november 2000 we
joined three other minimills and four integrated producers and filed
antidumping cases against imports of hotrolled sheet from 11 countries
argentina india indonesia kazakhstan the netherlands the peoples republic
of china romania south africa taiwan thailand and ukraine and
countervailing duty cases against five countries argentina india indonesia
south africa and thailand on august 17 2001 the itc made final affirmative
injury determinations on imports of hotrolled steel from argentina and south
africa and the department of commerce imposed antidumping duty orders of
4045 on hotrolled steel imported from argentina and 93 on hotrolled steel
imported from south africa on september 23 2001 the department of commerce
issued the following final dumping margins although these margins are subject
to modification from pending litigation on hotrolled steel imported from india
 2943 indonesia  48 kazakhstan  2435 the netherlands  3 china
 6491 romania  1780 taiwan  2029 thailand  420 and ukraine 
90 in addition the department of commerce issued the following final
countervailing duties on hotrolled steel imported from the following countries
india  832 indonesia  10 south africa  63 and thailand  24 the
itc made final affirmative injury determinations on these remaining cases in
november 2001 and the department of commerce imposed antidumping duty orders
these orders are supposed to remain in effect for at least five years although
they are subject to annual administrative review and may be shortened at the
end of five years the itc will conduct a sunset review to the extent that any
of the foregoing duty orders remain in effect of the foregoing final orders by
the itc only one involving the netherlands was appealed to the court of
international trade and the itc determination was recently upheld in june
2002 the us granted market economy status to russia which may enable
russia to more effectively defend itself against future dumping actions on the
basis of russian production costs rather than on the basis of comparison with
surrogate country production costs

      coldrolled sheet

      in june 1999 we together with other domestic producers and the united
steel workers of america also filed a complaint with the itc and the department
of commerce seeking a determination that coldrolled steel products from
argentina brazil china indonesia japan slovakia south africa taiwan
thailand turkey and venezuela were being dumped in the us market at below
fair market prices on july 19 1999 the itc made unanimous affirmative
preliminary determinations of a reasonable indication of injury by reason of
such imports the department of commerce announced preliminary dumping
determinations which required the posting of dumping duties in november and
december of 1999 in january 2000 the department of commerce issued a
determination that imports of coldrolled steel from six of the countries were
dumped at margins ranging from 17 to 81 we were ultimately not successful in
these coldrolled cases however and on march 3 2000 and thereafter the itc
made negative final injury determinations against these eleven countries ruling
that the industry was not being injured by these imports these negative
outcomes resulted in a resurgence of dumped coldrolled imports in the second
half of 2000 and depressed coldrolled prices caused by these unfair practices
as a consequence of the approximate 50 increase in imports of coldrolled sheet
steel from 20 countries during the first half of 2001 at prices averaging 50
or more below their 1998 prices that the department of commerce had determined
at that time to have been dumped we together with nucor united states steel
bethlehem ltv national weirton and wci brought antidumping petitions on
september 28 2001 against imports from these 20 countries and countervailing
duty petitions against five countries these countries including argentina
australia belgium brazil china france germany india japan south korea
the netherlands new zealand russia south africa spain sweden taiwan
thailand turkey and venezuela represented nearly 80 of the imported
coldrolled sheet in a preliminary ruling in november 2001 the itc found in
favor of the petitioners and between march and may 2002 the us department
of commerce found that these imports had been sold in the united states at less
than fair value and that those from brazil france and south korea had also been
subsidized accordingly the us department of commerce issued various
preliminary antidumping duty or countervailing duty margin orders directed at
most of these countries

      however on august 27 2002 the itc made a negative injury determination
on coldrolled imports from australia india japan sweden and thailand and on
october 17 2002 determined that no material injury or threatened injury
resulted from coldrolled steel under investigation from argentina belgium
brazil france germany south korea the netherlands new zealand russia
south africa spain taiwan turkey and venezuela these negative injury
determinations by the itc had the effect of reversing the us department of
commerces imposition of antidumping and countervailing duty margins on
products of these countries the steel industry petitioners have appealed these
negative injury determinations by the itc to the court of international trade
and briefing is expected to occur between may and september 2003

      structural steel and rail

      in addition to the various hot and cold flatrolled steel cases a number
of structural steel producers have prosecuted antidumping cases against imports
of structural steel in july 1999 nucoryamato txichaparral and northwestern
steel and wire filed antidumping cases on imports of structural steel products
from germany japan korea and spain germany and spain were subsequently
dropped from these cases in april 2000 the department of commerce found duties
of 3265 on imports from japan and 1545 on imports from korea in june 2000
in a 60 vote the itc found injury or threat of injury to the us structural
steel industry and the department of commerce imposed antidumping duty orders
these orders can remain in effect for at least five years subject however to
annual administrative review at the end of five years the itc will conduct a
sunset review in may 2001 a coalition of us structural steel beam producers
filed antidumping petitions with the department of commerce and the itc
alleging that imports of structural steel beams from eight other countries
china germany italy luxembourg russia south africa spain and taiwan are
being sold at less than fair value and are causing or threatening to cause
material injury to the us structural steel beam industry while the department
of commerce found that these imports were being sold in the united states at
less than fair value and therefore made affirmative dumping findings the itc
on june 17 2002 determined that such imports did not materially injure or
threaten with material injury an industry in the united states as a result the
itc made final negative injury determinations in all such cases thus ending
these investigations without the imposition of duties

      rebar

      in july 2000 certain rebar manufacturers filed a petition with the itc
against the dumping of rebar in certain united states markets in august 2000
the itc issued a preliminary determination of injury or threatened injury
resulting in an imposition of duties by the us department of commerce ranging
from 17 to 133 on imports from eight countries these orders will remain in
effect for five years subject to sunset review as well as the normal annual
administrative review that could result in a shortening of the duty orders

      there are antidumping duty and countervailing duty orders against imports
of rails from canada however there are currently no canadian steel makers
producing rails there are no antidumping duty or countervailing duty orders
outstanding against imports of rails from any other country nor are there any
current investigations

      although there are a number of additional trade cases pending before the
itc involving various groups of imported steel products most rulings since
the march 2002 imposition by president bush of the section 201 tariffs described
below have been against the us steel industry regarding incremental duties
and tariffs

section 201 investigation

      on june 5 2001 president bush announced a threepart program to address
the excessive imports of steel that were depressing markets in the united
states the program involves 1 negotiations with foreign governments seeking
nearterm elimination of inefficient excess steel production capacity throughout
the world 2 negotiations with foreign governments to establish rules that
will govern steel trade in the future and eliminate subsidies and 3 an
investigation by the itc under section 201 of the trade act of 1974 to determine
whether steel is being imported into the united states in such quantities as to
be a substantial cause of serious injury to the us steel industry therefore
on june 22 2001 the bush administration requested that the itc initiate an
investigation under section 201 of the trade act of 1974 products included in
the request were in the following categories subject to exclusion of certain
products

      1   carbon and alloy flat products

      2   carbon and alloy long products

      3   carbon and alloy pipe and tube and

      4   stainless steel and alloy tool steel products

      hotrolled coldrolled and coated steel

      on october 22 2001 in the first step of the threestep section 201
process the itc ruled that approximately 80 of the us steel industry
suffered material injury due to imported steel products including carbon and
alloy hotrolled coldrolled coated and semifinished slab products as well
as hot rolled bars reinforcing bars and light shapes of the 33 steel products
included in the petition brought by the us trade representative and president
bush 12 products including the products we produce were affirmed for injury
by unanimous 60 votes on december 7 2001 in the second step of the process
the itc recommended tariffs


                                       18
page
of approximately 2040 as well as tariff quotas in some cases and these
recommendations were transmitted to president bush for final action on march 5
2002 in the third and final step of the section 201 process president bush
imposed a three year tariff of 30 for the first year 24 for the second year
and 18 for the third year on imports of hotrolled coldrolled and coated
sheet he also imposed a tariff of 15 for the first year 12 for the second
year and 9 for the third year on imports of tubular steel products and a
tariff on imported steel slabs of 30 24 and 18 in the first second and
third years respectively on tons in excess of an annual quota of 54 million
in 2002 59 million in 2003 and 64 million in 2004 north american free trade
agreement partners of the united states principally canada and mexico were
excluded from the tariffs as were developing countries which in the
aggregate account for less than 3 of imported steel these section 201
remedies are cumulative with any existing tariffs or quotas in the antidumping
cases they are also directed at products rather than the countries that produce
those products thereby providing some import relief even if some steel products
find their way to exporting countries not covered by antidumping margin or
countervailing duty orders

      the presidents decision to implement a section 201 remedy is not
appealable to us courts however foreign governments may appeal to the wto
and the european union japan and other countries prosecuted such appeals these
dispute settlement proceedings at the wto and further appeals to the appellate
body of the wto generally take 1524 months the wto is expected to announce its
initial decision on the pending challenges against the section 201 tariffs by
april 2003 however a country or an importer may request specific exemptions
from the operation of a section 201 tariff and to date more than 800 of such
exemption requests have been filed and granted a second round of exemption
requests is currently underway and may result in further product exemptions
moreover a number of countries have imposed or threatened to impose various
retaliatory tariffs on us steel or other products and there is intense
political pressure from steel consumers to prematurely terminate the section 201
relief accordingly there is a risk that rulings adverse to the united states
or these substantial political pressures could result in the president changing
the remedy granting substantial additional exemptions from the remedy or
terminating the remedy entirely prior to the full three years although any such
modification would apply only prospectively

      structural steel and rail

      by a vote of 42 the itc determined on october 22 2001 that structural
steel and rails were not being imported into the united states in such increased
quantities as to be a substantial cause of serious injury or the threat of
serious injury to the us industry consequently the us structural steel and
rail producers are not directly eligible for any relief imposed by the president
as a result of the section 201 investigations the itc determined that the us
structural steel and rail industry was not seriously injured primarily because
of its doubledigit operating margins and positive performance trends
including increased capacity and shipments higher employment and new
investment with regard to threat of injury the itc found that the existing
orders and the pending investigations made future increases in imports unlikely

      rebar merchant bar and sbq products

      president bushs march 2002 section 201 order granting tariff relief to
various categories of imported steel products included a 15 tariff on rebar and
a 30 tariff on various certain merchant and sbq products

      as provided by president bush however when he announced the section 201
action in march 2002 itc will conduct a midterm review in the third quarter of
2003 covering all of the product categories covered by the section 201 orders
and the itc will then recommend to the president whether to maintain the
tariffs reduce them more quickly or end them prior to their scheduled
expiration

integrated mills versus minimills

      there are generally two kinds of primary steel producers integrated
mills and minimills we are a minimill producer

      steel manufacturing by an integrated producer involves a series of
distinct but related processes often separated in time and in plant geography
the process involves ironmaking followed by steelmaking followed by billet or
slab making followed by reheating and further rolling into steel plate or bar
or flatrolling into sheet steel or coil these processes may in turn be
followed by various finishing processes including coldrolling or various
coating processes including galvanizing in integrated producer steelmaking
coal is converted to coke in a coke oven then combined in a blast furnace with
iron ore or pellets and limestone to produce pig iron and then combined with
scrap in a basic oxygen or other furnace to produce raw or liquid steel once
produced the liquid steel is metallurgically refined and then either poured as
ingots for later reheating and processing or transported to a continuous caster
for casting into a billet or slab which is then further shaped or rolled into
its final form typically though not always and whether by design or as a
result of downsizing or reconfiguration many of these processes take place in
separate and remote facilities


                                       19
page
      in contrast minimills such as our butler minimill our columbia city
minimill and our pittsboro indiana minimill use an electric arc furnace to
directly melt scrap or scrap substitutes thus entirely eliminating the
energyintensive blast furnace a minimill unifies the melting casting and the
hotrolling into a continuous process the melting process begins with the
charging of a furnace vessel with scrap steel carbon and lime following which
the furnace vessels top is swung into place electrodes are lowered into the
furnace vessel through holes in top of the furnace and electricity is applied
to melt the scrap the liquid steel is then checked for chemistry and the
necessary metallurgical adjustments are made typically while the steel is still
in the melting furnace or if the plant has a separate staging area for that
process as do our minimills the liquid steel is transported to an area
commonly known as a ladle metallurgy station from there the liquid steel is
transported to a continuous caster which consists of a turret a tundish a
type of reservoir which controls the flow of liquid steel and a watercooled
copperlined mold the liquid steel passes through the continuous caster and
exits as an externally solid slab the slab is then cut to length and proceeds
directly into a tunnel furnace which maintains and equalizes the slabs
temperature after leaving the tunnel furnace the slab is descaled and then it
proceeds into the first stand of a rolling mill operation in the rolling
process the steel is progressively reduced in thickness the final product is
wound into coil and may be sold either directly to endusers or to intermediate
steel processors or service centers where it may be pickled coldrolled
annealed tempered or galvanized

      as a group minimills have historically been characterized by lower costs
of production and higher productivity than integrated mills this is due in
part to lower capital costs and to lower operating costs resulting from their
streamlined melting process and smaller more efficient plant layouts moreover
minimills have tended to employ a management culture such as ours that
emphasizes flexible incentiveoriented nonunion labor practices and have
tended to be more willing to adapt to newer and more innovative management
styles that encourage decentralized decisionmaking the smaller plant size of a
minimill also permits greater flexibility in the choice of location for the
minimill in order to optimize access to scrap supply energy costs
infrastructure and markets as is the case with our butler minimill
furthermore a minimills more efficient plant size and layout which
incorporates the melt shop metallurgical station casting and rolling in a
unified continuous flow under the same roof have reduced or eliminated costly
rehandling and reheating of partially finished product they have also adapted
quickly to the use of new and costeffective equipment thereby translating
technological advances in the industry into efficient production however as a
result of the movement toward steel industry consolidation coupled with the
emergence from bankruptcy of previously inefficient and high capital cost and
high operating cost steelmaking assets under new ownership with renegotiated
and less burdensome labor contracts the cost differences between minimills and
some integrated mill consolidators have begun to narrow moreover during
periods of high scrap material costs integrated mills that produce their own
blast furnace iron and are not as dependent as minimills upon scrap for the
bulk of their melt mix may actually experience lower raw material metallic
costs than minimills

the flatroll steel market

      the flatroll steel market represents the largest steel product group
accounting for an average of 64 of total us steel shipments from 1997 to
2001 flatrolled products consist of hotrolled coldrolled and coated sheet
and coil

      the following table shows the us shipments of flatrolled steel in net
tons by hotrolled coldrolled and coated production as reported by the
american iron and steel institute for the five years from 1997 through 2001

      hotrolled products

      all coiled flatrolled steel is initially hotrolled a process that
consists of passing a cast slab through a multistand rolling mill to reduce its
thickness to less than 12 inch hotrolled steel is minimally processed steel
coil that is used in the manufacture of various nonsurface critical
applications such as automobile suspension arms frames wheels and other
unexposed parts in auto and truck bodies agricultural equipment construction
products machinery tubing pipe tools lawn care products and guard rails

      coldrolled products

      coldrolled steel is hotrolled steel that has been further processed
through a pickler and then successively passed through a rolling mill without
reheating until the desired gauge or thickness and other physical properties
have been achieved coldrolling reduces gauge and hardens the steel and when
further processed through an annealing furnace and a temper mill improves
uniformity ductility and formability coldrolling can also impart various
surface finishes and textures coldrolled steel is used in exposed steel
applications that demand higher surface quality or finish such as exposed
automobile and appliance panels as a result coldrolled prices are typically
higher than hotrolled prices typically coldrolled material is coated or
painted

      coated products

      coated steel can be either hotrolled or coldrolled steel that has been
coated with zinc to render it corrosionresistant and to improve its
paintability hotdipped galvanized galvannealed electrogalvanized and
aluminized products are types of coated steels these are also the highest
valueadded sheet products because they require the greatest degree of
processing and tend to have the strictest quality requirements coated steel is

the structural steel market

      the structural steel market is a relatively small part of total us steel
shipments in 1999 2000 and 2001 structural steel shipments were 57 million
tons 67 million tons and 64 million tons respectively and averaging 6 of
the total steel market during these three years consumption of structural steel
products is influenced both by new construction and manufacturing activity and
by the selection of steel over alternative structural or manufacturing
materials which has occurred at a relatively constant rate of 50 over the five
years from 1997 through 2001

the rail market

      rail shipments in 2000 and 2001 were approximately 810000 tons and
644000 tons respectively with standard rail averaging 80 of the market over
1999 2000 and 2001 and premium or headhardened rail averaging 20 over 1999
2000 and 2001 increased rail hardness results in a longer lasting product and
is achieved by quenching hot rail with either air or water or by changing rail
chemistry through the addition of alloys harder rail is more costly rail is
produced in or imported into the us and canadian markets in standard lengths
of 39 to 80 feet mainly due to the limitations of existing north american rail
production equipment and plant layouts as well as the size limitations of ocean
freighters with respect to imports as a result in order to produce the
1600foot rail strings desired by railroads 20 80foot rail sections are
required to be welded together each weld is costly to make and adds
installation and periodic maintenance costs

      of the total annual shipments of rail in 2000 approximately 75 was
produced by the two remaining us rail producers and 25 was imported mainly
from japan and from europe there are currently no canadian rail producers

the market for rebar merchant bar and sbq products

      according to data reported by the american iron and steel institute or
aisi apparent rebar supply in the united states was approximately 8 million
tons in each of 2000 and 2001 and apparent merchant bar supply typically
defined as astm a36 round square or flat bar with a major dimension less than 3
inches was approximately 2 million tons nationally for each of 2000 and 2001
according to the aisi apparent supply of light structural shapes also
characterized by a major dimension of less than 3 inches average approximately
4 million tons annually for each of the foregoing two years

      accordingly to aisi data apparent sbq supply has averaged
approximately 7 million tons nationally over the 2000 and 2001 period

energy resources

      electricity

      with respect to our butler minimill our electric service contract with
american electric power extends through december 31 2007 the contract
designates only 152 hours as interruptible service during 2003 and these
interruptible hours further decrease annually through expiration of the
agreement the contract also provides that the circumstances necessary to
warrant any hours of service interruptions must be of an emergency nature and
not related to price and demand the contract also establishes an agreed fixed
rate for the rest of our electrical usage interruptible service subjects us to
the risk of interruption at any time in the operation of the aep system whether
as a result of an aep peak demand or even if aep were able to obtain a higher
market price from an alternate buyer

      with respect to our columbia city structural steel and rail minimill the
plant site is located within the service territory of northeast indiana
remc a rural electric cooperative and a member of the wabash valley power
association we have not yet finalized any electricity supply arrangements for
this minimill but once finalized we will be required to arrange power
transmission over lines owned by american electric power

      with respect to our pittsboro indiana bar mill the plant is located
within the service territory claimed by cinergy formerly known as public
service of indiana we do not as yet have an electricity supply arrangement for
this minimill and are currently in negotiations with cinergy with respect to
this matter

      gas

      we use approximately 9000 to 11000 decatherms of natural gas per day in
our butler flatroll minimill a decatherm is equivalent to 1 million btus or
1000 cubic feet of natural gas we have a delivery contract on the panhandle
eastern pipeline that extends through april 2008 relating to our butler
minimill we also have a delivery contract with nipsconiflcrossroads that
extends through october 2005 relating to our butler minimill we maintain a
liquid propane storage facility on site in butler with sufficient reserves to
sustain operations at our flatroll minimill for approximately one week in the
event of an interruption in the natural gas supply

      with respect to our structural steel and rail minimill we have entered
into an agreement with nipsco for gas service under its rate schedule 330 which
will provide firm burnertip supply and transportation service for all natural
gas requirements at this minimill the agreement includes a volumedependent
transportation fee and forgoes all balancing charges this agreement precludes
the need for a separate pipeline transportation agreement the agreement is for
a period of three years beginning with the first use of gas in production we
anticipate purchasing gas at market prices at commencement of operations
however we expect to minimize price volatility by entering into hedging
transactions on the futures markets

      with respect to our pittsboro indiana bar mill we are currently
reviewing but have not yet finalized our gas purchase and transportation
arrangements

      other

      we use oxygen nitrogen hydrogen and argon for production purposes which
for our butler minimill we purchase from the adjacent plant of air products
and chemicals inc air products uses its plant not only to supply us but also
to provide oxygen and other gases to other industrial customers as a result we
have been able to effect very favorable oxygen and other gas purchase prices on
the basis of air products volume production praxair inc has built a similar
facility within our columbia city minimill praxair will be a captive facility
to our columbia city minimill air liquide built a plant adjacent to our
pittsboro indiana bar mill under an arrangement with the previous owners of
the mill and we are in the process of negotiating a new contract with air
liquide to determine whether we will be supplied by that facility or will make
arrangements for an alternative source of supply

patents and trademarks

      we have a trademark for the mark sdi and an accompanying design of a
steel coil and a chevron our iron dynamics subsidiary has filed five patent
applications with the us patent and trademark office relating to its methods
of producing low sulfur liquid pig iron as of the date of this filing we have
received three of those patents

research and development

      at the present time we engage in no third party research and development
activities our iron dynamics subsidiary


                                       22

however has been engaged in research and development efforts in connection with
its attempts to develop a process for the production of direct reduced iron and
the conversion of that product into liquid pig iron most of this research and
development effort has been conducted inhouse by iron dynamics officers and
employees

environmental matters

      our operations are subject to substantial and evolving local state and
federal environmental health and safety laws and regulations concerning among
other things emissions to the air discharges to surface and ground water and
to sewer systems noise control and the generation handling storage
transportation treatment and disposal of toxic and hazardous substances in
particular we are dependent upon both state and federal permits regulating
discharges into the air or into the water in order to be permitted to operate
our facilities we believe that in all current respects our facilities are in
material compliance with all provisions of federal and state laws concerning the
environment and we do not believe that future compliance with such provisions
will have a material adverse effect on our results of operations cash flows or
financial condition we have applied to the indiana department of environmental
management for the issuance of a new air permit for our pittsboro indiana bar
mill and we anticipate that it will be issued in time for us to be able to
commence production as planned in the first quarter of 2004

      since environmental laws and regulations are becoming increasingly
stringent and the subject of increasingly vigorous enforcement our
environmental capital expenditures and costs for environmental compliance will
likely increase in the future in addition due to the possibility of
unanticipated regulatory or other developments the amount and timing of future
environmental expenditures may vary substantially from those currently
anticipated the cost for current and future environmental compliance may also
place us steel producers at a competitive disadvantage with respect to foreign
steel producers which may not be required to undertake equivalent costs in
their operations

      pursuant to the resource conservation and recovery act or rcra which
governs the treatment handling and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes the
united states environmental protection agency or us epa and authorized state
environmental agencies conduct inspections of rcra regulated facilities to
identify areas where there may have been releases of solid or hazardous
constituents into the environment and require the facilities to take corrective
action to remediate any such releases rcra also allows citizens to bring
certain suits against regulated facilities for potential damages and clean up
our steelmaking facilities are subject to rcra our manufacturing operations
produce various byproducts some of which for example are electric arc
furnace or eaf dust are categorized as industrial or hazardous waste requiring
special handling for disposal or for the recovery of metallics we collect such
byproducts in approved baghouses and other facilities but we are also
examining alternative reclamation technologies to recycle some of these
products the iron dynamics scrap substitute process is an example of such an
alternative while we cannot predict the future actions of the regulators or
other interested parties the potential exists for required corrective action at
these facilities the costs of which could be substantial

      under the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability
act or cercla the us epa and in some instances private parties have the
authority to impose joint and several liability for the remediation of
contaminated properties upon generators of waste current and former site owners
and operators transporters and other potentially responsible parties
regardless of fault or the legality of the original disposal activity many
states including indiana have statutes and regulatory authorities similar to
cercla and to the us epa we have a number of waste handling agreements with
various contractors including a hazardous waste disposal agreement with
envirosafe services of ohio inc to properly dispose of our electric arc
furnace dust and certain other waste products of steelmaking however we cannot
assure you that even if there has been no fault by us we may not still be
cited as a waste generator by reason of an environmental clean up at a site to
which our waste products were transported

      in addition to rcra and cercla there are a number of other environmental
health and safety laws and regulations that apply to our facilities and may
affect our operations

employees

      our work force consisted of 869 employees at december 31 2002 excluding
employees then employed by new millennium this figure does not include
employees that will eventually be employed once operational at our newly
acquired pittsboro indiana bar mill and our newly acquired galvanizing facility
in jeffersonville indiana none of steel dynamics or new millenniums
employees are represented by labor unions we believe that our relationship with
our employees is good

risk factors

      the risks described below are not the only ones facing our company
additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial
may also impair our business operations

      our business financial condition or results of operations could be
materially adversely affected by any of these risks

risks related to our industry

      in recent years imports of steel into the united states have adversely
      affected and may again adversely affect us steel prices which would
      impact our sales margins and profitability

      excessive imports of steel into the united states have in recent years
and may again in the future exert downward pressure on us steel prices and
significantly reduce our sales margins and profitability us steel producers
compete with many foreign producers competition from foreign producers is
typically strong but it has greatly increased as a result of an excess of
foreign steelmaking capacity and a weakening of certain foreign economies
particularly in eastern europe asia and latin america the economic
difficulties in these countries have resulted in lower local demand for steel
products and have tended to encourage greater steel exports to the united states
at depressed prices

      in addition we believe the downward pressure on and depressed levels of
us steel prices in recent years have been further exacerbated by imports of
steel involving dumping and subsidy abuses by foreign steel producers some
foreign steel producers are owned controlled or subsidized by foreign
governments as a result decisions by these producers with respect to their
production sales and pricing are often influenced to a greater degree by
political and economic policy considerations than by prevailing market
conditions realities of the marketplace or consideration of profit or loss for
example between 1998 and 2001 when imports of hotrolled and coldrolled
products increased dramatically domestic steel producers including us were
adversely affected by unfairly priced or dumped imported steel even though
various protective actions taken by the us government during 2001 including
the enactment of various steel import quotas and tariffs have resulted in an
abatement of some steel imports during 2002 these protective measures are only
temporary when these measures expire or if they are relaxed or if increasingly
higher us steel prices enable foreign steelmakers to export their steel
products into the united states even with the presence of tariffs the
resurgence of substantial imports of foreign steel could again create downward
pressure on us steel prices in addition domestic steel companies as well as
labor unions have filed complaints with the international trade commission and
the us department of commerce against certain hotrolled coldrolled and
structural steel imports in june of 2002 the itc made final negative injury
determinations in cases relating to structural steel imports from china
germany italy luxembourg russia south africa spain and taiwan in addition
in august and october of 2002 the itc also made final negative injury
determinations in all outstanding cases relating to coldrolled steel thus
ending the investigations without the imposition of duties these negative
determinations may increase the amount of coldrolled and structural steel
imports into the united states and may create further downward pressure on us
steel prices in june of 2002 the united states granted market economy status
to russia which may enable russia to more effectively defend itself against
dumping actions and increase the risk that russia in the future may dump steel
into the us market which may adversely affect us steel prices

      intense competition and excess global capacity in the steel industry may
      continue to exert downward pressure on our pricing

      we may not be able to compete effectively in the future as a result of
intense competition competition within the steel industry both domestically
and worldwide is intense and it is expected to remain so we compete primarily
on the basis of 1 price 2 quality and 3 the ability to meet our
customers product needs and delivery schedules our primary competitors are
other minimills which may have cost structures and management cultures more
similar to ours than integrated mills we also compete with many integrated
producers of hotrolled coldrolled and coated products many of which are
larger and have substantially greater capital resources the highly competitive
nature of the industry in part exerts downward pressure on prices for some of
our products further over the past few years approximately 30 domestic steel
producers have entered bankruptcy proceedings in some cases these previously
marginal producers have been able to emerge from bankruptcy reorganization with
lower and more competitive cost structures in other cases steelmaking assets
have been sold through bankruptcy proceedings to other steelmakers or to new
companies at greatly depressed prices and free of many previously burdensome
operating costs and liabilities the reemergence of these producers or their
successors may further increase the competitive environment in the steel
industry and contribute to price declines in the case of certain product
applications steel competes with other materials including plastic aluminum
graphite composites ceramics glass wood and concrete

      in addition global overcapacity in steel manufacturing and its negative
impact on us steel pricing are likely to continue to persist and could have a
negative impact on our sales margins and profitability the us steel industry
continues to be adversely


                                       24

impacted by excess global steel manufacturing capacity over the last decade
the construction of new minimills expansion and improved production
efficiencies of some integrated mills and substantial expansion of foreign steel
capacity have all led to the excess of manufacturing capacity increasingly
this overcapacity combined with the high levels of steel imports into the
united states has exerted downward pressure on domestic steel prices including
the prices of our products and has resulted in at times a dramatic narrowing
or with many companies the elimination of gross margins

      the positive effects of president bushs march 5 2002 order in
      contributing to the reduction of excessive imports of steel into the
      united states may be lessened if there are successful appeals to the world
      trade organization by the exporting countries or if domestic or
      international political pressure results in a relaxation of or
      substantial exemptions from the tariffs contained in the order

      if the amount scope or duration of the section 201 orders are lessened or
adversely changed it could lead to a resurgence of flatrolled steel imports
an increase of steel slab imports andor an increase in welded pipe and tube
imports any of these results would again put downward pressure on us
flatrolled prices which would negatively impact our sales margins and
profitability on june 22 2001 the bush administration requested that the
international trade commission or itc initiate an investigation under section
201 of the trade act of 1974 to determine whether steel is being imported into
the united states in such quantities as to be a substantial cause of serious
injury to the us steel industry in october 2001 the itc found serious
injury due to imports of steel products including the products we manufacture
and in december 2001 the itc recommended that the president impose tariffs of
approximately 2040 as well as tariff quotas in connection with certain
products such as steel slabs on march 5 2002 president bush among other
actions imposed a three year tariff of 30 for the first year 24 for the
second year and 18 for the third year on imports of hotrolled coldrolled and
coated sheet as well as on imports of steel slabs in excess of a specified
annual quota north american free trade agreement partners of the united states
principally canada and mexico are excluded from these tariffs as are
developing countries that account for less than 3 of imported steel
increased imports from these excluded countries may reduce the benefit from
these tariffs to us steel producers including us

      imports of flatrolled steel have declined in part due to the imposition
of dumping duties that have been imposed on certain imports of foreign steel
and in part due to the imposition of significant tariffs as a result of this
section 201 action these events have in part allowed us to begin restoring
prices on flatrolled products while the presidents decision to implement a
section 201 remedy is not appealable to us courts foreign governments may
appeal and some have appealed to the world trade organization or wto the
european union japan and other countries are currently prosecuting such
appeals these dispute settlement proceedings at the wto and further appeals to
the appellate body of the wto generally take 1524 months these appeals were
filed in april of 2002 and may be concluded by the end of 2003 moreover a
number of affected countries have threatened to impose various retaliatory
tariffs on us steel or other products or have sought various product
exemptions from the imposition of the tariffs accordingly there is a risk that
rulings adverse to the united states or substantial political pressures could
result in the president changing the remedy granting substantial exemptions
from the remedy or terminating the remedy entirely prior to the full three
years although any such modification would apply only prospectively

      our level of production and our sales and earnings are subject to
      significant fluctuations as a result of the cyclical nature of the steel
      industry and the industries we serve

      the price of steel and steel products may fluctuate significantly due to
many factors beyond our control this fluctuation directly affects the levels of
our production and our sales and earnings the steel industry is highly
cyclical sensitive to general economic conditions and dependent on the
condition of certain other industries the demand for steel products is
generally affected by macroeconomic fluctuations in the united states and global
economies in which steel companies sell their products for example future
economic downturns stagnant economies or currency fluctuations in the united
states or globally could decrease the demand for our products or increase the
amount of imports of steel into the united states either event of which would
decrease our sales margins and profitability

      in addition a disruption or downturn in the automotive oil and gas gas
transmission construction commercial equipment rail transportation
appliance agricultural and durable goods industries could negatively impact our
financial condition production sales margins and earnings we are also
particularly sensitive to trends and events including strikes and labor unrest
that may impact these industries these industries are significant markets for
our products and are themselves highly cyclical

risks related to our business

      technology operating and startup risks associated with our iron dynamics
      scrap substitute project may prevent us from realizing the anticipated
      benefits from this project and could result in a loss of our investment

      if we abandon our iron dynamics project or if its process does not
succeed we will not be able to realize the expected benefits of this project
and will suffer the loss of our entire investment as of december 31 2002 our
investment in the iron dynamics project was 160 million since 1997 our
whollyowned subsidiary iron dynamics has tried to develop and commercialize a
pioneering process of producing a virgin form of iron that might serve as a
lower cost substitute for a portion of the metallic raw material mix that goes
into our electric arc furnaces to be melted into new steel this scrap
substitute project is the first of its kind it involves processes that are
based on various technical assumptions and new applications of technologies that
have yet to be commercially proven since our initial startup in august 1999
we have encountered a number of difficulties associated with major pieces of
equipment and with operating processes and systems throughout the latter part
of each of 1999 and 2000 our iron dynamics facility was shut down during these
shut downs we engaged in time consuming and expensive redesign reengineering
reconstruction and retrofitting of major pieces of equipment systems and
processes as a result the iron dynamics project has taken considerably longer
and has required us to expend considerably greater resources than originally
anticipated while we made significant progress during these shut downs in
correcting various technical and other deficiencies we have not yet been
successful in achieving the results necessary to bring production output up and
product costs down to the point of being commercially competitive in february
2001 we restarted operations at our iron dynamics facility however in july
2001 we suspended these operations again with no specific date set for
resumption of operations this shut down was a result of

      1   higher than expected startup and process refinement costs

      2   then prevailing exceptionally high energy costs

      3   low production quantities then being achieved at the iron dynamics
            facility and

      4   historically low steel scrap pricing

      these factors made the cost of producing and using iron dynamics scrap
substitute at our flatroll minimill higher than our cost of purchasing and
using steel scrap furthermore we believe that even with additional
development and refinement to the equipment technology systems and processes
the iron dynamics facility may only be able to achieve monthly output levels
between 7585 of our original estimates resulting in higher unit costs than
originally planned we currently estimate that these additional developments and
refinements will cost approximately 14 million on july 10 2002 we announced
that we would begin experimental production trials in the fourth quarter of
2002 during the fourth quarter of 2002 we successfully completed certain
trials on february 24 2003 we announced that we have made plans to restart
our ironmaking operations during the second half of 2002 if the results of this
restart indicate that we will be able to produce liquid pig iron in sufficient
quantities and at a cost to be competitive with purchased pig iron we could
begin commercial production in late 2003 however iron dynamics may never
become commercially operational

      in addition while we remain optimistic that the remaining startup
difficulties with the equipment technology systems and processes can be
resolved our iron dynamics facility may not be able to consistently operate or
be able to produce steel scrap substitute material in the quantities that will
enable it to be cost competitive moreover in connection with any restart of
operations our iron dynamics facility may experience additional shutdowns or
equipment failures and such shutdowns or failures may have a material adverse
impact on our liquidity cost structure and earnings

      we may be delayed in the construction and startup of our pittsboro
      indiana minimill

      on september 6 2002 we purchased through our wholly owned subsidiary
dynamic bar products llc qualitech steel sbq llcs special bar quality
minimill assets located in pittsboro indiana we paid 45 million for these
assets and we have announced plans to invest between 70 to 75 million in
plant upgrades and retrofitting to convert the facility from one capable of
producing only special bar quality steel products to a facility capable of
producing merchant bars and shapes and reinforcing bar products

      it may cost more than the 70 to 75 million we estimate is required to
convert the pittsboro minimill into a minimill for the production of merchant
and reinforcing bar we are also subject to regulatory approval and to
construction and startup delays and operational risks associated with the
startup of a new minimill either in the pittsboro minimills present
configuration or in connection with its conversion the factors could result in
materially greater operating costs than we initially expected we may also be
delayed either as a result of other unforeseen circumstances or events beyond
our control

      a substantial portion of our flatrolled products are sold on the spot
      market and therefore our sales margins and earnings are negatively
      impacted by decreases in domestic flatrolled steel prices

      our sales margins and earnings are negatively impacted by decreases in
domestic flatrolled steel prices since a significant portion of our flatrolled
products are sold on the spot market as a result we are vulnerable to
downturns in the domestic flatrolled steel market for the three year period
ended december 31 2002 approximately 80 of our flatroll products were sold
on the spot market under contracts with terms of twelve months or less

      weakness in the automotive industry would result in a substantial
      reduction in demand for our products

      a prolonged weakness in the automotive industry would reduce the demand
for our products and decrease our sales in addition if automobile
manufacturers choose to incorporate more plastics aluminum and other steel
substitutes in their automobiles it could reduce demand for our products our
sales and earnings fluctuate due to the cyclical nature of the automotive
industry the cyclical nature of the automotive industry is affected by such
things as the level of consumer spending the strength or weakness of the us
dollar and the impact of international trade and various factors such as labor
unrest and the availability of raw materials which affect the ability of the
automotive industry to actually build cars while we do not presently sell a
material portion of our steel production directly to the automotive market a
substantial portion of our sales to the intermediate steel processor and service
center market is resold to various companies in the automotive industry

      we may be unable to pass on increases in the cost of scrap and other raw
      materials to our customers which would reduce our earnings

      if we are unable to pass on higher scrap and other raw material costs to
our customers we will be less profitable we may not be able to adjust our
product prices especially in the shortterm to recover the costs of increases
in scrap and other raw material prices our principal raw material is scrap
metal derived primarily from junked automobiles industrial scrap railroad
cars railroad track materials agricultural machinery and demolition scrap from
obsolete structures containers and machines the prices for scrap are subject
to market forces largely beyond our control including demand by us and
international steel producers freight costs and speculation the prices for
scrap have varied significantly are currently relatively high may continue to
vary significantly in the future and do not necessarily fluctuate in tandem with
the price of steel in addition our operations require substantial amounts of
other raw materials including various types of pig iron alloys refractories
oxygen natural gas and electricity the price and availability of which are
also subject to market conditions

      we have primarily relied upon one supplier to meet our steel scrap
      requirements

      since our inception we have had a scrap supply relationship with
omnisource corporation one of the largest scrap processors and brokers in the
midwest for our supply of steel scrap our current agreement with omnisource
expires on december 31 2004 however we or omnisource may terminate the
agreement at any time on or after july 1 2003 if the contract terminates for
any reason we would have to find another supplier for steel scrap or develop
our own scrap purchasing capability we may be unable to secure substitute
arrangements for steel scrap on the same or better terms as those in our
contract with omnisource in addition if our contract is adversely changed for
any reason we may experience an increase in our cost of goods sold

      for the years ended december 31 2001 and 2002 we purchased 15 million
tons and 21 million tons respectively of steel scrap and scrap substitutes
from omnisource which represented approximately 87 and 82 respectively of
our total scrap tons purchased during those periods

      there may be potential conflicts of interest with regard to our
      relationship with omnisource

      with respect to any dispute between us and omnisource involving our
existing contract including its remaining term any future contract or in
connection with the terms of any commercial transaction omnisource may be
viewed as having a conflict of interest between what it perceives as being best
for itself as a seller of scrap and what is best for us as a buyer of scrap we
may not be able to resolve potential conflicts and if we do resolve them we may
receive a less favorable resolution since we are dealing with omnisource rather
than an unaffiliated person the chief operating officer of omnisource is also a
member of our board of directors and is a stockholder of steel dynamics this
person has obligations to us as well as to omnisource and may have conflicts of
interest with respect to matters potentially or actually involving or affecting
us and omnisource omnisource also supplies scrap to many other customers
including other steel mills

      we rely upon a small number of major customers for a substantial
      percentage of our sales

      a loss of any large customer or group of customers could materially reduce
our sales and earnings we have substantial business relationships with a few
large customers for the years ended december 31 2001 and 2002 our butler
minimills top ten customers accounted for approximately 48 and 54 of our
total net sales respectively during those periods our largest customer
heidtman accounted for approximately 18 and 17 of our total net sales we
expect to continue to depend upon a small number of customers for a significant
percentage of our total net sales and cannot assure you that any of them will
continue to purchase steel from us

      there may be potential conflicts of interest with regard to our
      relationship with heidtman steel products inc

      if a dispute arises between us and heidtman we may be viewed as having a
conflict of interest what is best for heidtman as a buyer and what is best for
us as a product seller may be at odds we may be unable to resolve potential
conflicts if we do resolve them we may receive a less favorable resolution
since we are dealing with heidtman rather than an unaffiliated person heidtman
is an affiliate of one of our large stockholders and its president and chief
executive officer serves as one of our directors this person has obligations to
us as well as to heidtman and may have conflicts of interest with respect to
matters potentially or actually involving or affecting us and heidtman

      unexpected equipment failures may lead to production curtailments or
      shutdowns

      interruptions in our production capabilities will inevitably increase our
production costs and reduce our sales and earnings for the affected period in
addition to equipment failures our facilities are also subject to the risk of
catastrophic loss due to unanticipated events such as fires explosions or
violent weather conditions our manufacturing processes are dependent upon
critical pieces of steelmaking equipment such as our furnaces continuous
casters and rolling equipment as well as electrical equipment such as
transformers and this equipment may on occasion be out of service as a result
of unanticipated failures we have experienced and may in the future experience
material plant shutdowns or periods of reduced production as a result of such
equipment failures

      we depend heavily on our senior management and we may be unable to replace
      key executives if they leave

      the loss of the services of one or more members of our senior management
team or our inability to attract retain and maintain additional senior
management personnel could harm our business financial condition results of
operations and future prospects our senior management founded our company
pioneered the development of thinslab flatrolled technology and directed the
construction of our butler minimill and columbia city structural minimill our
operations and prospects depend in large part on the performance of our senior
management team including keith e busse president and chief executive
officer mark d millett vice president and general manager of our flatroll
division richard p teets jr vice president and general manager of our
structural division tracy l shellabarger vice president and chief financial
officer and john w nolan vice president sales and marketing although these
senior managers have each been employees and stockholders of steel dynamics for
more than seven years these individuals may not remain with us as employees in
addition we may not be able to find qualified replacements for any of these
individuals if their services are no longer available we do not have key man
insurance on any of these individuals

      we may face risks associated with the implementation of our growth
      strategy

      our growth strategy subjects us to various risks as part of our growth
strategy we may expand our existing facilities build additional plants
acquire other businesses and steel assets enter into joint ventures or form
strategic alliances that we believe will complement our existing business these
transactions will likely involve some or all of the following risks

           the difficulty of competing for acquisitions and other growth
            opportunities with companies having materially greater financial
            resources than ours

           the difficulty of integrating the acquired operations and personnel
            into our existing business

           the potential disruption of our ongoing business

           the diversion of resources

           the inability of management to maintain uniform standards controls
            procedures and polices


                                       28

           the difficulty of managing the growth of a larger company

           the risk of entering markets in which we have little experience

           the risk of becoming involved in labor commercial or regulatory
            disputes or litigation related to the new enterprise

           the risk of contractual or operational liability to our venture
            participants or to third parties as a result of our participation

           the inability to work efficiently with joint venture or strategic
            alliance partners and

           the difficulties of terminating joint ventures or strategic
            alliances

      these transactions might be required for us to remain competitive but we
may not be able to complete any such transactions on favorable terms or obtain
financing if necessary for such transactions on favorable terms future
transactions may not improve our competitive position and business prospects as
anticipated and if they do not our sales and earnings may be significantly
reduced

      environmental regulation imposes substantial costs and limitations on our
      operations

      we are subject to the risk of substantial environmental liability and
limitations on our operations brought about by the requirements of environmental
laws and regulations we are subject to various federal state and local
environmental health and safety laws and regulations concerning such issues as
air emissions wastewater discharges solid and hazardous waste handling and
disposal and the investigation and remediation of contamination these laws and
regulations are increasingly stringent while we believe that our facilities are
and will continue to be in material compliance with all applicable environmental
laws and regulations the risks of substantial costs and liabilities related to
compliance with such laws and regulations are an inherent part of our business
although we are not currently involved in any remediation activities it is
possible that future conditions may develop arise or be discovered that create
substantial environmental remediation liabilities and costs for example our
steelmaking operations produce certain waste products such as electric arc
furnace dust which are classified as hazardous waste and must be properly
disposed of under applicable environmental laws these laws can impose clean up
liability on generators of hazardous waste and other substances that are shipped
offsite for disposal regardless of fault or the legality of the disposal
activities other laws may require us to investigate and remediate contamination
at our properties including contamination that was caused in whole or in part
by third parties while we believe that we can comply with environmental
legislation and regulatory requirements and that the costs of doing so have been
included within our budgeted cost estimates it is possible that such compliance
will prove to be more limiting and costly than anticipated in addition we need
to obtain the air permit for our coil coating facility at our butler minimill
which we expect to be issued in the near future and the air permit for our
pittsboro minimill for which we have yet to make an application there is no
guarantee that we will obtain these permits and any failure to do so could
adversely affect our business

      in addition to potential clean up liability in the past we have been and
in the future we may become subject to substantial monetary fines and penalties
for violation of applicable laws regulations or administrative conditions we
may also be subject from time to time to legal proceedings brought by private
parties or governmental agencies with respect to environmental matters
including matters involving alleged property damage or personal injury

risks related to our company

      we have substantial indebtedness and debt service requirements which
      limits our financial and operating flexibility

      as of december 31 2002 we had indebtedness of 179 million under our
senior secured credit facility 200 million in connection with our 9 12
senior notes due 2009 and 100 million in connection with our 4 convertible
subordinated notes due 2012 on january 3 2003 the initial purchasers of our
4 convertible subordinated notes exercised their right to purchase an
additional 15 million of the notes

      our substantial indebtedness limits our financial and operating
flexibility for example it could

           make it more difficult to satisfy our obligations with respect to
            our debt including our various notes

           limit our ability to obtain additional financing for working
            capital capital expenditures acquisitions or general corporate
            purposes


                                       29

           require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from
            operations to payments on our debt reducing our ability to use
            these funds for other purposes

           limit our ability to adjust rapidly to changing market conditions
            and

           increase our vulnerability to downturns in general economic
            conditions or in our business

      our ability to satisfy our debt obligations will depend upon our future
operating performance which in turn will depend upon the successful
implementation of our strategy and upon financial competitive regulatory
technical and other factors many of which are beyond our control if we are not
able to generate sufficient cash from operations to make payments under our
credit agreements or to meet our other debt service obligations we will need to
refinance our indebtedness our ability to obtain such financing will depend
upon our financial condition at the time the restrictions in the agreements
governing our indebtedness and other factors including general market and
economic conditions if such refinancing were not possible we could be forced
to dispose of assets at unfavorable prices even if we could obtain such
financing we cannot be sure that it would be on terms that are favorable to us
in addition we could default on our debt obligations

      our senior secured credit agreement and the indenture relating to our
      9 12 senior notes due 2009 contain restrictive covenants that may limit
      our flexibility

      restrictions and covenants in our existing debt agreements including our
senior secured credit agreement and the indenture relating to our 9 12 senior
notes due 2009 and any future financing agreements may impair our ability to
finance future operations or capital needs or to engage in other business
activities specifically these agreements will restrict our ability to

           incur additional indebtedness

           pay dividends or make distributions with respect to our capital
            stock

           repurchase or redeem capital stock

           make investments

           create liens and enter into sale and leaseback transactions

           make capital expenditures

           enter into transactions with affiliates or related persons

           issue or sell stock of certain subsidiaries

           sell or transfer assets and

           participate in certain joint ventures acquisitions or mergers

      a breach of any of the restrictions or covenants in our debt agreements
could cause a default under our senior secured credit agreement other debt or
the notes a significant portion of our indebtedness then may become immediately
due and payable we are not certain whether we would have or be able to obtain
sufficient funds to make these accelerated payments including payments on the
notes

      we may not have sufficient cash flow to make payments on our notes and our
      other debt

      our ability to pay principal and interest on our various notes and on our
other debt and to fund our planned capital expenditures depends on our future
operating performance our future operating performance is subject to a number
of risks and uncertainties that are often beyond our control including general
economic conditions and financial competitive regulatory and environmental
factors for a discussion of some of these risks and uncertainties please see
risk factors  risks related to our business consequently we may not have
sufficient cash flow to meet our liquidity needs including making payments on
our indebtedness


                                       30
page
      if our cash flow and capital resources are insufficient to allow us to
make scheduled payments on our various notes or on our other debt we may have
to sell assets seek additional capital or restructure or refinance our debt if
we are required to do that the terms of our debt may not allow for these
alternative measures even if permitted such measures might not satisfy our
scheduled debt service obligations

      if we cannot make scheduled payments on our debt

           our debtholders could declare all outstanding principal and interest
            to be due and payable

           the lenders under our senior secured credit agreement could
            terminate their commitments and commence foreclosure proceedings
            against our assets and

           we could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation

           you could lose all or part of your investment in the notes

      despite our substantial indebtedness we may still incur significantly
      more debt which could further increase the risks described above

      the terms of our senior secured credit agreement and the indentures
related to our 4 convertible subordinated notes due 2012 and our 9 12 senior
notes due 2009 do not prohibit us or our subsidiaries from incurring additional
indebtedness in the future any additional debt could be senior to the notes and
could increase the risks described above

      our stock price may be volatile and could decline substantially

      our stock price may decline substantially as a result of the volatile
nature of the stock market and other factors beyond our control the stock
market has from time to time experienced extreme price and volume
fluctuations many factors may cause the market price for our common stock to
decline including

     our operating results failing to meet the expectations of securities
      analysts or investors in any quarter

     downward revisions in securities analysts estimates

     material announcements by us or our competitors

     public sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock

     governmental regulatory action or

     adverse changes in general market conditions or economic trends

in the past companies that have experienced volatility in the market price of
their stock have been the subject of securities class action litigation if we
become involved in securities class action litigation in the future it could
result in substantial costs and diversion of management attention and resources
thus harming our business

      conversion of our 4 convertible subordinated notes due 2012 will dilute
      the ownership interests of existing stockholders

      the conversion of some or all of our 4 convertible subordinated notes due
2012 will dilute the ownership interest of existing stockholders any sales in
the public market of the common stock issuable upon such conversion could
adversely affect prevailing market prices of our common stock in addition the
existence of the notes may encourage short selling by market participants
because the conversion of the notes could depress the price of our common stock

      shares eligible for public sale could adversely affect our stock price

      the future sale of a substantial number of our shares of common stock in
the public market or the perception that such sales could occur could
significantly reduce our stock price it could also make it more difficult for
us to raise funds through equity offerings in the future as of march 21 2003
we had 47659398 shares of common stock outstanding including 14000371

      we do not expect to pay cash dividends in the foreseeable future

      since our initial public offering we have not declared or paid cash or
other dividends on our common stock and do not expect to pay cash dividends for
the foreseeable future we currently intend to retain all future earnings for
use in the operation of our business and to fund future growth in addition the
terms of our senior secured credit agreement and the indenture relating to our
senior notes restrict our ability to pay cash dividends even if these
restrictions are removed any future cash dividends will depend upon our results
of operations financial conditions cash requirements the availability of a
surplus and other factors

      provisions under indiana law may deter acquisition bids for us

      provisions under the indiana business corporation law may have the effect
of delaying or preventing transactions involving a change of control including
transactions in which stockholders might otherwise receive a substantial premium
for their shares over then current market prices as a result these provisions
may limit the ability of stockholders to approve transactions that they may deem
to be in their best interest or may delay or frustrate the removal of incumbent

         of operations

      the following discussion contains forwardlooking statements that involve
numerous risks and uncertainties our actual results could differ materially
from those discussed in the forwardlooking statements as a result of these
risks and uncertainties including those set forth in this report under
forwardlooking statements and under risk factors you should read the
following discussion in conjunction with selected financial data and our
consolidated financial statements and notes appearing elsewhere in this filing

business discussion

      we are a domestic steel manufacturing company that primarily owns and
operates electric arc furnace minimills our steel operations include a flat
roll division a structural and rail division and a forthcoming bar division

      our flat roll division is currently our core business and consists of a
flatroll minimill located in butler indiana which we built and have operated
since 1996 with an annual estimated production capacity of 22 million tons of
flatrolled steel although we achieved record production of 24 million tons
during 2002 our flat roll division produces a broad range of highquality
hotrolled coldrolled and coated steel products including a large variety of
valueadded and highmargin specialty products such as thinnergauge rolled
products and galvanized products we sell our flatrolled products directly to
endusers intermediate steel processors and service centers located primarily
in the midwestern united states our flatrolled products are used in numerous
industry sectors including the automotive construction and commercial
industries our largest customer heidtman steel products inc purchased 146
million of our flatrolled products or 17 of our consolidated net sales
during 2002 sales from our flat roll division accounted for 89 of our
consolidated net sales during 2001 and 2002

      during may 2002 our flat roll division announced plans to construct a new
coil coating facility at our butler minimill at a cost of approximately 25 to
30 million we expect to complete construction of this facility and commence
coating operations during mid2003 we are constructing this facility to have an
annual production capacity of 240000 tons of coated flatrolled products as
another addition to our flat roll division on march 14 2003 we purchased the
galvanizing assets of galvpro ii llc for 175 million plus a potential of an
additional 15 million based on an earnout formula this steel coating
facility is located in jeffersonville indiana and has an estimated annual
production capacity of between 300000 and 350000 tons of lightgauge
hotdipped coldrolled galvanized steel we plan to primarily supply the
jeffersonville facility with steel coils from our flat roll division we
anticipate investing an additional 2 to 6 million for certain equipment
modifications and upgrades to the facility with production beginning in
mid2003 these additions to our flat roll division should enable us to further
increase our mix of highermargin valueadded steel product sales

      our structural and rail division consists of a structural and rail
minimill located in columbia city indiana we began construction in may 2001
completed the facility in april 2002 and commenced commercial structural steel
operations during the third quarter of 2002 during 2002 we recorded
preproduction startup costs of 13 million our structural and rail minimill
is designed to have an annual production capacity of up to 13 million tons of
structural steel beams pilings and other steel components as well as standard
and premiumgrade rails we are currently producing at approximately 45 of
capacity although our structural steel sales accounted for only 2 of our
consolidated net sales during 2002 through regular product introductions and
continued production rampup of structural steel products the structural and
rail division should be able to offer a full complement of wideflange beam and
hpiling structural steel products by the end of the first quarter of 2003 in
addition we expect to begin production of standard rail products during the
second quarter of 2003 initial rail production will be used in a testing
capacity to be monitored by individual railroad companies for qualification
purposes this qualification process may take between six and nine months for
completion we generally sell our structural products directly to endusers and
steel service centers for use in the construction transportation and industrial
machinery markets

      on september 9 2002 we purchased the special bar quality minimill
assets of qualitech steel sbq llc located in pittsboro indiana for 45
million we plan to invest between 70 and 75 million of additional capital to
convert the facility to the production of merchant bars and shapes and
reinforcing bar products as well as sbq products we anticipate our bar
division will have an annual production capacity of between 500000 and 600000
tons and that initial production will commence during the first quarter of 2004
we plan to market the bar products directly to endusers fabricators and steel
service centers for the construction transportation and industrial machinery
markets

      the us steel industry has historically been and continues to be highly
cyclical in nature evidenced by a significant downturn in the second half of
2000 through most of 2001 during this period our business was also adversely
impacted with our net sales declining from 693 million in 2000 to 607 million
in 2001 and our earnings declining from 54 million in 2000 to 3 million in
2001 however during 2002 domestic flatrolled steel prices increased
dramatically to more normalized levels from historical cyclical lows in 2001
this increase resulted from a number of factors including 1 a reduction in
domestic steel production capacity


                                       36
page
as a result of past bankruptcies and shutdowns of other us steel producers
2 a reduction in imports driven in part by favorable rulings with respect to
tariffs and quotas on foreign steel and 3 a strengthening of the overall us
economy and the need for endusers of steel products to replenish their depleted
inventories as a result of our efficient lowcost operations and these
improvements in the domestic flatroll steel markets we achieved record
consolidated net sales of 864 million and net income of 78 million during
2002 during the first quarter of 2003 however we have experienced downward
pricing pressure due in part to a weakened economy and decreased demand and in
part to the reappearances in the market place of substantial domestic steel
production tonnage that had left the market during 2002 this has resulted in a
softening of flatrolled steel prices in addition to decreased sales prices we
are also experiencing an increase in our cost of metallic raw materials causing
a further tightening in our first quarter 2003 margins

      metallic raw materials used in our electric arc furnaces represent our
singlemost significant manufacturing cost generally accounting for between 45
and 50 of our consolidated cost of goods sold the metallic raw material mix
utilized in our electric arc furnaces is composed of approximately 85 steel
scrap and 15 alternative iron units from the second quarter of 2000 throughout
2001 we experienced a steady decline in metallic raw material pricing reaching
historically low levels in the fourth quarter of 2001 however during 2002 and
into the first quarter of 2003 we have experienced a steady pricing increase
we believe this increase is partly due to increased demand for these metals from
foreign steel manufacturers

      since 1997 in an effort to reduce our exposure to these metals markets
we have tried to develop and commercialize a pioneering process for the
production of a virgin form of iron which might serve as a lowercost substitute
for the alternative iron units utilized in our electric arc furnaces for melting
into new steel our process involves the production and conversion of
directreduced iron into liquid pig iron at our iron making facility iron
dynamics since we began initial operations at iron dynamics in 1999 the
facility has produced and sold a minimal amount of liquid pig iron to our flat
roll division during 1999 and 2000 we encountered a number of difficulties
associated with major pieces of equipment and operating processes causing us to
shut down the facility for redesign reengineering and retrofitting in july
2001 we indefinitely suspended operations due to a higherthanexpected
startup and process refinement costs b lowerthanexpected production
quantities c exceptionally high energy costs and d historically low steel
scrap pricing these factors made the cost of producing and using iron dynamics
scrap substitute at our flat roll division higher than our cost of purchasing
and using steel scrap more specifically pig iron during the next year we
continued to evaluate our systems and processes and on july 10 2002 we
announced that iron dynamics would begin experimental production trials in the
fourth quarter of 2002 after an evaluation of these trials we concluded that
the improved production technology and the ability to recycle waste materials
might significantly reduce the perunit cost of liquid pig iron production we
believe that the restart of the facility is feasible based upon this potential
cost reduction coupled with currently higher steel scrap prices and with the
anticipated cost benefits to be realized at our flat roll division from the use
of liquid pig iron on february 24 2003 we announced plans to restart iron
dynamics and currently expect that operations will restart during the second
half of 2003 we could begin commercial production later in the year if the
results of our restart indicate that we will be able to produce liquid pig iron
in sufficient quantities and at a cost to be competitive with purchased pig
iron during 2003 we expect to invest 14 million of additional capital for the
necessary modifications and refinements to the facility

      during the first quarter of 2003 we also increased our ownership interest
in our consolidated subsidiary new millennium building systems from 466 to
100 for approximately 8 million new millennium began production in 2000 and
produces joists girders trusses and steel roof and floor decking which is
sold primarily in the upper midwest nonresidential building components market

marginally higher prices for our valueadded products from our cold mill these
products include hotrolled and coldrolled galvanized products and coldrolled
products

2002 vs 2001

      net sales our net sales were 8645 million with total shipments of 24
million net tons during 2002 as compared to net sales of 6070 million with
total shipments of 20 million net tons during 2001 an increase in net sales of
2575 million or 42 and an increase in total shipments of 427000 net tons
or 22 the entire steel industry experienced pricing declines from the second
half of 2000 throughout 2001 reaching the low in the fourth quarter of 2001
however during 2002 prices of domestic flatrolled steel which accounted for
93 of our consolidated net sales during the year increased dramatically to
more normalized levels for reasons previously described during 2002 our
average consolidated selling price per ton increased approximately 53 or 17
in comparison to 2001

      cost of goods sold cost of goods sold was 6389 million during 2002 as
compared to 5229 million during 2001 an increase of 1160 million or 22
which was due in large part to record sales and production volumes as a
percentage of net sales cost of goods sold represented approximately 74 and
86 during the years 2002 and 2001 respectively we experienced a narrowing of
our gross margin throughout 2001 as our average sales price per ton decreased
more rapidly than our average metallic raw material cost per ton which is the
most significant single component of our cost of goods sold however during
2002 our gross margin strengthened as our average product pricing increased by
a greater degree than our average metallic costs and as we realized greater
operating efficiencies through increased production metallic raw materials
represented 48 and 44 of our cost of goods sold during 2002 and 2001
respectively we experienced a steady decline in metallic costs from the second
quarter of 2000 through the first quarter of 2002 at which time this downward
trend ended our average metallic raw material cost per hotband ton produced
was 6 or 5 higher during 2002 than during 2001

      selling general and administrative expenses selling general and
administrative expenses were 617 million during 2002 as compared to 581
million during 2001 an increase of 36 million or 6 a portion of these
expenses in both years was attributable to performancerelated employee
incentive programs facility startup costs and litigation costs associated
with the nakornthai strip mill public company ltd or nsm litigation efforts
costs associated with our performancerelated employee profitsharing plan
increased approximately 72 million during our record earnings year of 2002 as
compared to 2001 during the first six months of 2002 costs associated with
startup activities at our structural and rail division were 132 million
compared to startup costs during 2001 of 195 million of which 84 million
related to the structural and rail division and 110 million related to iron
dynamics litigation costs associated with the nsm litigation efforts were
262000 and 89 million during 2002 and 2001 respectively as a percentage of
net sales selling general and administrative expenses represented
approximately 7 and 10 during 2002 and 2001 respectively

      interest expense interest expense was 302 million during 2002 as
compared to 185 million during 2001 an increase of 117 million or 63
during 2002 gross interest expense increased 22 to 416 million and
capitalized interest decreased 18 to 114 million as compared to 2001 the
increase in our gross interest expense despite the 7 decrease in our total
debt was due to an increase in our average interest rate caused by the march
2002 refinancing in which we accessed traditionally higherpriced public debt
markets the decrease in our capitalized interest resulted from the reduction of
interest required to be capitalized with respect to our structural and rail
division since construction was substantially complete at june 30 2002

      other income expense other expense was 37 million during 2002 as
compared to 23 million during 2001 an increase of 14 million on may 6

recorded settlement costs of 45 million and 23 million net of any insurance
proceeds in association with the nsmrelated lawsuits during 2002 and 2001
respectively

      income taxes during 2002 our income tax provision was 487 million
less a 21 million tax benefit related to our extraordinary loss on debt
extinguishments during 2002 as compared to 20 million during 2001 our
effective tax rate was 374 and 385 for 2002 and 2001 respectively during
2001 we recorded a 19 million deferred tax asset valuation allowance related
to foreign tax credits that may not be fully realized this allowance is still
outstanding at december 31 2002

      extraordinary items during 2002 we recorded an extraordinary loss of
35 million less a related tax benefit of 21 million related to the
writeoff of deferred financing costs due to our march and december refinancing

of 2000 throughout 2001 reaching the low in the fourth quarter of 2001 during
2001 the average selling price per ton decreased approximately 52 or 14 in
comparison to the same period in 2000 resulting in a 12 decline in net sales
despite a 2 increase in net shipments heidtman our largest customer
accounted for approximately 18 and 21 of our net sales during 2001 and 2000
respectively

      cost of goods sold cost of goods sold was 5229 million during 2001 as
compared to 5339 million during 2000 a decrease of 110 million or 2
metallic raw materials represented approximately 44 and 51 of the total cost
of goods sold during 2001 and 2000 respectively we experienced a steady
decline in our metallic raw material pricing from the second quarter of 2000
throughout 2001 reaching the low in the fourth quarter of 2001 the costs
associated with these metals averaged 18 or 14 per ton less during 2001 than
during 2000 as a percentage of net sales cost of goods sold represented
approximately 86 and 77 for the years 2001 and 2000 respectively we
experienced a narrowing of our gross margin throughout 2001 as our average sales
price per ton decreased more rapidly than our average metallic raw material cost
per ton

      selling general and administrative expenses selling general and
administrative expenses were 581 million during 2001 as compared to 533
million during 2000 an increase of 48 million or 9 a substantial portion
of these expenses in both years was attributable to costs associated with the
nsm litigation efforts and startup costs associated with iron dynamics and the
structural and rail mill litigation costs associated with the nsm litigation
efforts were 89 million for 2001 as compared to 61 million for 2000 an
increase of 28 million or 45 startup costs were 195 million of which
iron dynamics represents 110 million including 17 million of interest
expense during 2001 as compared to total startup costs of 199 million of
which iron dynamics represents 124 million during 2000 a decrease of
393000 or 2 during 2001 we also recorded bad debt expense of 60 million
as compared to 349000 during 2000 an increase of 57 million approximately
47 million of this increase in bad debt expense was the result of two flat
roll division customers declaring bankruptcy during 2001 as a percentage of net
sales selling general and administrative expenses represented approximately
10 and 8 during 2001 and 2000 respectively

      interest expense interest expense was 185 million during 2001 as
compared to 202 million during 2000 a decrease of 17 million or 9 gross
interest expense decreased 10 to 341 million and capitalized interest
decreased 20 to 140 million for 2001 as compared to 2000 throughout 2001
base interest rates more specifically libor and prime rates steadily decreased
in comparison to 2000 levels resulting in the 10 decrease in our gross
interest expense despite a 4 increase in our total net debt total debt
including other longterm contingent liabilities less cash and cash
equivalents

      other income expense other expense was 23 million during 2001 as
compared to 719000 during 2000 an increase of 16 million during 2001 we
recorded settlement costs along with the offsetting insurance proceeds
associated with settlements of a portion of the nsmrelated lawsuits on march
7 2002 we settled one of two remaining nsmrelated lawsuits which was
outstanding on december 31 2001 accordingly we reflected a settlement cost of
23 million which represents the settlement amount not covered by insurance
proceeds in our financial results for 2001 during 2000 other expense included
the writeoff of the remaining investment in nsm of approximately 14 million

      income taxes our income tax provision was 20 million with an effective
tax rate of 385 during 2001 as compared to 307 million with an effective
tax rate of 363 during 2000 during 2001 we recorded a 19 million deferred
tax asset valuation allowance related to foreign tax credits that may not be
fully realized this allowance was offset by a 14 million reduction in the
effective tax rate applied to our cumulative net deferred tax liability

liquidity and capital resources

      our business is capital intensive and requires substantial expenditures
for among other things the purchase and maintenance of equipment used in our
steelmaking and finishing operations and to remain in compliance with
environmental laws our shortterm and longterm liquidity needs arise primarily
from capital expenditures working capital requirements and principal and
interest payments related to our outstanding indebtedness we have met these
liquidity requirements with cash provided by operations equity longterm
borrowings state and local grants and capital cost reimbursements

cash flows

      during 2002 cash provided by operating activities was 1150 million as
compared to 674 million during 2001 an increase of 476 million or 71
primarily driven by our increases in earnings during 2002 cash used in
investing activities for
page
capital investments was 1338 million and 907 million for 2002 and 2001
respectively approximately 59 of our capital investment costs during 2002 were
incurred in the construction of our structural and rail division and
approximately 34 were used to purchase our bar division assets in pittsboro
indiana cash used in financing activities was 353 million during 2002 and
cash provided by financing activities was 914 million during 2001 our
decrease in funds due to financing activities during 2002 resulted from our
change in capital structure during march and december and from a decrease in
iron dynamics debt due to an agreement with the iron dynamics senior bank
lenders to extinguish 370 million of senior secured debt during march 2002
we also spent 177 million on costs related to our march and december
refinancing activities in which we accessed the public debt markets for the
first time these refinancings allowed us to lengthen scheduled debt
amortizations and achieve greater financial flexibility through further capital
diversification

      during 2002 we received benefits from state and local governments in the
form of real estate and personal property tax abatements of approximately 45
million based on our current abatements and utilizing our existing longlived
asset structure we estimate the remaining annual effect on future operations to
be approximately 33 million 28 million 22 million 13 million
998000 536000 269000 63000 and 25000 during the years 2003 through
2011 respectively

liquidity

      we believe the principal indicators of our liquidity are our cash
position remaining availability under our bank credit facilities and excess
working capital during 2002 our cash position decreased 540 million to 242
million and our working capital position increased 33 million to 1974
million as compared to december 31 2001 as of december 31 2002 750
million under our senior secured revolving credit facility remained undrawn and
available our ability to draw down the revolver is dependent upon our continued
compliance with the financial covenants and other covenants contained in our
senior secured credit agreement we were in compliance with these covenants at
december 31 2002 and expect to be in compliance during 2003

      in march 2002 we issued 2000 million of 95 senior unsecured notes and
we entered into a new 3500 million senior secured credit agreement in order to
refinance our existing senior secured and unsecured credit facilities and to
obtain additional working capital the 3500 million credit facility was made
available to us as 750 million in the form of a fiveyear revolving credit
facility 700 million in the form of a fiveyear term a loan and 2050
million in the form of a sixyear term b loan the new senior secured credit
agreement is secured by liens and mortgages on substantially all of our personal
and real property assets by liens and mortgages on substantially all of the
personal and real property assets of our whollyowned subsidiaries and by
pledges of all shares of capital stock and intercompany debt held by us and
each whollyowned subsidiary in addition our whollyowned subsidiaries have
guaranteed our obligations under the new senior secured credit agreement the
new senior secured credit agreement contains financial covenants and other
covenants that limit or restrict our ability to make capital expenditures incur
indebtedness permit liens on our property enter into transactions with
affiliates make restricted payments or investments enter into mergers
acquisitions or consolidations conduct asset sales pay dividends or
distributions and enter into other specified transactions and activities we are
also required to prepay any amounts that we borrowed with the proceeds we
receive from a number of specified events or transactions

      in december 2002 and january 2003 we issued 1150 million of 40
convertible subordinated notes in order to refinance 700 million of our senior
secured term a loan and 40 million of our senior secured term b loan holders
of our 40 notes may convert the notes into a maximum of 68 million shares of
our common stock under certain circumstances based on among other things the
market price of our common stock the assigned credit rating of our 40 notes
and certain other circumstances as defined within the prospectus during 2002
we recorded an extraordinary loss of 35 million less a related tax benefit of
21 million related to the writeoff of deferred financing costs due to the
march and december refinancing activities

      on january 28 2002 we entered into an agreement with the iron dynamics
lenders to extinguish the debt under the idi senior secured credit agreement at
the end of march 2002 we complied with each of the settlement requirements
thus constituting full and final settlement of all of iron dynamics obligations
and steel dynamics guarantees under the iron dynamics credit agreement in
meeting the requirements of the settlement agreement we paid 150 million in
cash and issued an aggregate of 220 million or 15 million shares of our
treasury stock during march 2002 in addition if iron dynamics resumes
operations by january 27 2007 and generates positive cash flow as defined in
the settlement agreement we are required to make contingent future payments in
an aggregate not to exceed 220 million the contingent future payments are
noninterestbearing and have been classified as noncurrent since no payments
are expected to be required during 2003

      our ability to meet our debt service obligations and reduce our total debt
will depend upon our future performance which in turn will depend upon general
economic financial and business conditions along with competition legislation
and regulation factors that are largely beyond our control in addition we
cannot assure you that our operating results cash flow and capital resources
will be sufficient for repayment of our indebtedness in the future we believe
that based upon current levels of operations and anticipated growth cash flow
from operations together with other available sources of funds including
additional borrowings under our senior secured credit agreement will be
adequate for the next two years for making required payments of principal and
interest on our indebtedness and for funding anticipated capital expenditures
and working capital requirements

      effective june 1 2000 the board of directors authorized the extension
and continuation of our 1997 share repurchase program allowing us to repurchase
an additional 5 or 23 million shares of our outstanding common stock at a
purchase price not to exceed 15 per share at december 31 2002 we had
acquired 38 million shares of our common stock in open market purchases of
which 3000 shares were purchased during 2002 none were purchased during 2001
and 25 million shares were purchased during 2000 the average price per share
of these purchases is 12 as of december 31 2002 approximately 954000 shares
remain available for repurchase under the june 2000 repurchase authorization

other matters

inflation

      we believe that inflation has not had a material effect on our results of
operations

environmental and other contingencies

      we have incurred and in the future will continue to incur capital
expenditures and operating expenses for matters relating to environmental
control remediation monitoring and compliance we believe apart from our
dependence on environmental construction and operating permits for our existing
and proposed manufacturing facilities such as our planned bar division in
pittsboro indiana that compliance with current environmental laws and
regulations is not likely to have a materially adverse effect on our financial
condition results of operations or liquidity however environmental laws and
regulations have changed rapidly in recent years and we may become subject to
more stringent environmental laws and regulations in the future

recent accounting pronouncements

      in april 2002 the financial accounting standards board fasb issued
statement no 145 fas 145 rescission of fasb statements no 4 44 64
amendment of fasb statement no 13 and technical corrections this statement
among other things rescinds fas 4 which required all gains and losses from
extinguishment of debt to be aggregated and if material classified as an
extraordinary item net of the related income tax effect we intend to adopt fas
145 as of january 1 2003 as required upon adoption any gain or loss on
extinguishment of debt that was classified as an extraordinary item in prior
periods presented that does not meet the criteria in apb 30 for classification
as an extraordinary item will be reclassified as income or loss from continuing
operations we have determined that the adoption of fas 145 will not have a
material impact on our consolidated financial statements the loss on
extinguishment of debt recorded in 2002 of 35 million net of related tax of
21 million will no longer be classified as an extraordinary item in our 2003
financial statements rather it will be included in our income from operations

      in july 2002 the fasb issued statement no 146 fas 146 accounting for
costs associated with exit or disposal activities the statement requires
companies to recognize costs associated with exit or disposal activities when
they are incurred rather than at the date of a commitment to an exit or disposal
plan costs covered by the standard include lease termination costs and certain
employee severance costs that are associated with a restructuring plant
closing or other exit or disposal activity fas 146 is effective for exit or
disposal activities initiated after december 31 2002 fas 146 may affect the
timing of our recognition of future exit or disposal costs if any

      in november 2002 the fasb issued interpretation no 45 fin 45
guarantors accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees including
indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others fin 45 requires companies at
the time certain guarantees are issued to recognize an initial liability for
the fair value of the obligations assumed under the guarantee fin 45 also
provides guidance concerning existing disclosure requirements related to
guarantees and warranties the initial recognition requirements of fin 45 are
effective for guarantees issued or modified after december 31 2002 and
adoption of the disclosure requirements is effective for us as of december 31
2002 we believe the adoption of fin 45 will not have a material impact on our
consolidated financial statements

critical accounting policies and estimates

      managements discussion and analysis of our financial condition and
results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements which
have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted
in the united states of america we review the accounting policies we use in
reporting our financial results on a regular basis the preparation of these
financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the
reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities we evaluate the appropriateness
of these estimations and judgments on an ongoing basis we base our estimates on
historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be
reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for
making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not
readily apparent from other sources results may differ from these estimates due
to actual outcomes being different from those on which we based our assumptions
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more
significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated
financial statements


                                       41
page
      revenue recognition and allowance for doubtful accounts we generally
recognize revenues from sales and the allowance for estimated costs associated
with returns from these sales when the product is shipped provision is made for
estimated product returns and customer claims based on estimates and actual
historical experience if the historical data used in our estimates does not
reflect future returns and claims trends additional provision may be necessary
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting
from the inability of our customers to make required payments if the financial
condition of our customers were to deteriorate resulting in the impairment of
their ability to make payments additional allowance may be required

      impairments of longlived assets in accordance with the methodology
described in fasb statement no 144 accounting for the impairment or disposal
of longlived assets we review longlived assets for impairment whenever
events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of such assets
may not be recoverable impairment losses are recorded on longlived assets used
in operations when indicators of impairment are present and the undiscounted
cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than the assets
carrying amounts the impairment loss is measured by comparing the fair value of
the asset to its carrying amount during 2002 events and circumstances
indicated that approximately 1170 million of assets related to iron dynamics
might be impaired however our estimate of undiscounted cash flows was
approximately 856 million in excess of such carrying amounts and therefore
no charge has been recorded at december 31 2002 we made various assumptions in
estimating the undiscounted cash flows including among other things a
weighted average of the most likely achieved production levels significant cost
components required capital expenditures and a date for resumption of
commercial production nonetheless it is reasonably possible that our estimate
of undiscounted cash flows may change in the near term due to among other
things technological changes economic conditions and changes in the business
model or changes in operating performance resulting in the need to writedown
those assets to fair value

      deferred tax assets and liabilities we are required to estimate our
income taxes as a part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial
statements this requires us to estimate our actual current tax exposure
together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing
treatments of items for tax and accounting purposes these differences result in
deferred tax assets and liabilities which are included within our consolidated
balance sheet we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets
will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent we believe that
recovery is not likely we must establish a valuation allowance as of december
31 2002 we had available foreign tax credit carryforwards of approximately
30 million for federal income tax purposes which expire in 2003 due to the
limited time frame remaining to utilize the foreign tax credits and the
decreased likelihood that the net operating losses will be fully absorbed prior
to the expiration of the credits a valuation allowance of 19 million was
created in 2001 even if these credits are not utilized as such they can be
treated as taxdeductible expenses therefore 11 million of foreign tax
credit remains as a deferred tax asset as of december 31 2002

      contingent liabilities the accrual of a contingency involves considerable
judgment on the part of management we use outside experts such as lawyers as
necessary to aid in the estimation of the probability that a loss will occur and
the amount or range of that potential loss during 1999 we were sued by
institutional purchasers in a 1998 note offering by certain investment banks on
behalf of nsm the owner and operator of a steel minimill in thailand for whom
we agreed to render certain postoffering technical and operational advisory
services during the second and third quarters of 2001 we settled seven of the
nine pending lawsuits and in the first half of 2002 we settled the two
remaining lawsuits in each case without any admission of liability and to the
extent of any monetary payments except for approximately 23 million recorded
in 2001 and 45 million recorded in the first quarter of 2002

item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk

      market risk

      in the normal course of business we are exposed to interest rate changes
our objectives in managing exposure to interest rate changes are to limit the
impact of these rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower overall
borrowing costs to achieve these objectives we primarily use interest rate
swaps to manage net exposure to interest rate changes related to our portfolio
of borrowings we generally maintain fixed rate debt as a percentage of our net
debt between a minimum and maximum percentage a portion of our debt has an
interest component that resets on a periodic basis to reflect current market
conditions

      the following table represents the principal cash repayments and related
weightedaverage interest rates by maturity date for our longterm debt as of
