we recognize that climate change warrants meaningful action in 2019 we announced our commitment to reduce our carbon equivalent emissions 50 by 2030 and achieve carbon equivalent net zero emissions by 2050 this goal encompasses emissions from our direct operations scope 1 and 2 emissions in alignment with the paris accord and the specific recommendations of the united nations un intergovernmental panel on climate change’s special report on global warming of 15 o c in 2020 we reset our carbon emissions reduction base year for this goal from 2012 to 2019 to account for corporate changes new acquisitions divestitures and to reflect changes in methodology in accordance with the greenhouse gas protocol we have proactively worked to reduce our scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas emissions over the last decade through the implementation of energyefficiency programs operational improvements and increased usage of renewable energy we also continue efforts to reduce our overall environmental footprint by using materials wisely and preserving land water and air quality our sustainability commitments include our formal participation in the un global compact and our commitment to the ten principles human rights labor environment and anticorruption the environmental principles include a precautionary approach to environmental challenges initiatives to promote a greater sense of environmental responsibility and the development of environmentally friendly technologies we have annually renewed our commitment to the un global compact since joining in 2019 

while we seek to embed and verify sound environmental practices throughout our business we are and may in the future be involved in voluntary remediation projects at current and former properties typically related to historical operations on rare occasions our remediation activities are conducted as specified by a government agencyissued consent decree or agreed order remediation costs at these properties are accrued using currently available facts existing environmental permits technology and presently enacted laws and regulations for sites where we are primarily responsible for the remediation our cost estimates are developed based on internal evaluations and are not discounted we record accruals when it is probable that we will be obligated to pay amounts for environmental site evaluation remediation or related activities and such amounts can be reasonably estimated accruals are recorded even if significant uncertainties exist over the ultimate cost of the remediation ongoing environmental compliance costs such as obtaining environmental permits installation and maintenance of pollution control equipment and waste disposal are expensed as incurred 

the us comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act known as superfund imposes liability for the release of a hazardous substance into the environment superfund liability is imposed without regard to fault even if the waste disposal was in compliance with laws and regulations we have been identified as a potentially responsible party prp at various superfund sites and we accrue our share if known of the estimated remediation costs for the site prps in superfund actions have joint and several liability and may be required to pay more than their proportional share of such costs 

in some cases it is not possible to quantify our ultimate exposure because the projects are either in the investigative or early remediation stage or superfund allocation information is not yet available based upon current information we believe that our overall compliance with environmental regulations including remediation obligations environmental compliance costs and capital expenditures for environmental control equipment will not have a material adverse effect on our capital expenditures earnings or competitive position because we have either established adequate reserves or our compliance cost based on available information is not expected to be material to our consolidated financial statements our total accrual for environmental remediation was 67 million and 78 million at december 31 2021 and 2020 respectively we continue to focus on reducing future environmental liabilities by maintaining appropriate company standards and by improving our environmental assurance programs

 item 1a risk factors 

an investment in our common stock involves various risks when considering an investment in the company one should carefully consider all of the risk factors described below as well as other information included and incorporated by reference in this annual report there may be additional risks uncertainties and matters not listed below that we are unaware of or that we currently consider immaterial any of these may adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows and thus the value of an investment in the company 

operational risks 

we operate in a highly competitive environment which may adversely affect our ability to succeed 

we operate in a highly competitive environment for marketing oilfield products and services and securing equipment our ability to continually provide competitive products and services can impact our ability to defend maintain or increase prices for our products and services maintain market share and negotiate acceptable contract terms with our customers in order to be competitive we must provide new and differentiating technologies reliable products and services that perform as expected and that create value for our customers 

in addition our investments in new technologies equipment and facilities may not provide competitive returns our ability to defend maintain or increase prices for our products and services is in part dependent on the industry’s capacity relative to customer demand and on our ability to differentiate the value delivered by our products and services from our competitors’ products and services managing development of competitive technology and new product introductions on a forecasted schedule and at a forecasted cost can impact our financial results if we are unable to continue to develop and produce competitive technology or deliver it to our clients in a timely and costcompetitive manner in various markets in which we operate or if competing technology accelerates the obsolescence of any of our products or services any competitive advantage that we may hold and in turn our business financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 

our business could be adversely affected by the widespread outbreak of a disease or virus the current global spread of the covid19 virus has and may continue to materially and adversely affect our results of operations cash flows and financial condition for an indeterminate amount of time 

the markets have experienced volatility in oil demand due to the economic impacts of the covid19 pandemic if demand for our products and services declines the utilization of our assets and the prices we are able to charge our customers for our products and services could decline the continued spread of covid19 or a similar pandemic could result in further instability in the markets and decreases in commodity prices resulting in further adverse impacts on our results of operations cash flows and financial condition 

in addition the continued spread of the covid19 virus or similar pandemics and the continuation of the measures to try to contain the virus or similar viruses such as vaccine mandates travel bans and restrictions quarantines shelter in place orders and shutdowns may further impact our workforce and operations the operations of our customers and those of our vendors and suppliers also if a significant number of our employees 

baker hughes company 2021 form 10k  14 

were to contract the virus or be quarantined we may not be able to complete key or critical tasks not limited to but including key financial reporting and operational controls there is considerable uncertainty regarding such measures and potential future measures which may result in labor disruptions employee attrition and could negatively impact our ability to attract and retain qualified employees all of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations cash flows and financial condition 

failure to effectively and timely execute our energy transition strategy could have an adverse effect on the demand for our technologies and services 

our future success may depend upon our ability to effectively execute on our energy transition strategy our strategy depends on our ability to develop additional technologies and work with our customers and partners to advance new energy solutions such as carbon capture utilization and storage hydrogen energy geothermal and other integrated solutions if the energy transition landscape changes faster than anticipated or faster than we can transition or if we fail to execute our energy transition strategy as planned demand for our technologies and services could be adversely affected 

disruptions in our supply chain the high cost or unavailability of raw materials equipment and supplies essential to our business could adversely affect our ability to execute our operations on a timely basis 

our manufacturing operations are dependent on having sufficient raw materials component parts and manufacturing capacity including labor available to meet our manufacturing plans on a timely basis at a reasonable cost while minimizing inventories disruptions within our supply chain has had and may continue to have an impact on our business and reputation including our ability to meet our manufacturing plans and revenue goals control costs and avoid shortages or oversupply of raw materials and component parts 

if we are unable to attract and retain qualified personnel we may not be able to execute our business strategy effectively and our operations could be adversely affected 

our operations and future success depend on our ability to recruit train and retain qualified personnel people are a key resource to developing manufacturing and delivering our products and providing technical services to our customers around the world a competent welltrained highly skilled motivated and diverse workforce has a positive impact on our ability to attract and retain business periods of rapid growth present a challenge to us and our industry to recruit train and retain our employees while also managing the impact of wage inflation and the limited available qualified labor in the markets where we operate 

our business could be impacted by both geopolitical and terrorism threats in countries where we or our customers do business and our business operations may be impacted by civil unrest andor government expropriations 

geopolitical and terrorism threats continue to grow in a number of key countries where we currently or may in the future do business geopolitical and terrorism threats including armed conflict among countries could lead to among other things a loss of our investment in the country adverse impact to our employees and impairment of our or our customers’ ability to conduct operations 

in addition to other geopolitical and terrorism risks civil unrest continues to grow in several countries where we do business our ability to conduct business operations may be impacted by that civil unrest and our assets in these countries may also be subject to expropriation by governments or other parties involved in civil unrest 

control of oil and natural gas reserves by national oil companies may impact the demand for our services and products and create additional risks in our operations  

much of the world’s oil and natural gas reserves are controlled by national oil companies national oil companies may require their contractors to meet local content requirements or other local standards such as conducting our operations through joint ventures with local partners that could be difficult or undesirable for us to meet the failure to meet the local content requirements and other local standards may adversely impact our operations in those countries in addition our ability to work with national oil companies is subject to our ability to negotiate and agree upon acceptable contract terms 

baker hughes company 2021 form 10k  15 

our operations involve a variety of operating hazards and risks that could cause losses 

the products that we manufacture and the services that we provide are complex and the failure of our equipment to operate properly or to meet specifications may greatly increase our customers’ costs in addition many of these products are used in inherently hazardous industries such as the offshore oilfield business these hazards include blowouts explosions nuclearrelated events fires collisions capsizings and severe weather conditions we may incur substantial liabilities or losses as a result of these hazards our insurance and contractual indemnity protection may not be sufficient or effective to protect us under all circumstances or against all risks the occurrence of a significant event against which we were not fully insured or indemnified or the failure of a customer to meet its indemnification obligations to us could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

seasonal and weather conditions could adversely affect demand for our services and operations 

variation from normal weather patterns such as cooler or warmer summers and winters can have a significant impact on demand for our services and operations adverse weather conditions such as hurricanes in the gulf of mexico may interrupt or curtail our operations or our customers’ operations cause supply disruptions and result in a loss of revenue and damage to our equipment and facilities which may or may not be insured for example extreme winter conditions in canada russia or the north sea may interrupt or curtail our operations or our customers’ operations in those areas and result in a loss of revenue 

we are subject to risks related to our relationship with ge 

we are partially dependent on ge through among other things our reliance on the longterm agreements between the company and ge we are also a party to a number of licenses with ge that give us rights to intellectual property that is necessary or useful to our business failure of ge to comply with these agreements could have an adverse impact on our business operations 

credit and customer contracting risks 

providing services on an integrated turnkey or fixed price basis could require us to assume additional risks 

we may choose to enter into integrated or turnkey contracts with our customers that require us to provide services and equipment outside of our core business providing services on an integrated or turnkey basis may also subject us to additional risks such as costs associated with unexpected delays or difficulties in drilling operations project management interface risk and risks associated with subcontracting and consortium arrangements these integrated or turnkey contracts may be fixed price contracts that do not allow us to recover for cost overruns unless they are directly caused by the customer 

we may not be able to satisfy technical requirements testing requirements or other specifications required under our service contracts and equipment purchase agreements 

our products are used in deepwater and other harsh environments and severe service applications our contracts with customers and customer requests for bids typically set forth detailed specifications or technical requirements for our products and services which may also include extensive testing requirements in addition scrutiny of the offshore drilling industry has resulted in more stringent technical specifications for our products and more comprehensive testing requirements for our products to ensure compliance with such specifications we cannot provide assurance that our products including products supplied through joint ventures will be able to satisfy the specifications or that we will be able to perform the fullscale testing necessary to prove that the product specifications are satisfied in future contract bids or under existing contracts or that the costs of modifications to our products to satisfy the specifications and testing will not adversely affect our results of operations 

we sometimes enter into consortium or similar arrangements for certain projects which could impose additional costs and obligations on us 

we sometimes enter into consortium or similar arrangements for certain projects under such arrangements each party is responsible for performing a certain scope of work within the total scope of the contracted work and 

baker hughes company 2021 form 10k  16 

the obligations expire when all contractual obligations are completed the failure or inability financially or otherwise of any of the parties to perform their obligations could impose additional costs and obligations on us these factors could result in unanticipated costs to complete the project liquidated damages or contract disputes 

our contracts may be terminated early in certain circumstances 

our contracts with customers generally may be terminated by the customer for convenience default or extended force majeure which could include inability to perform due to covid19 termination for convenience may require the payment of an early termination fee by the customer but the early termination fee may not fully compensate us for the loss of the contract termination by the customer for default or extended force majeure due to events outside of our control generally will not require the customer to pay an early termination fee 

our financial position results of operations or cash flows could be materially adversely affected if our customers terminate some of our contracts and we are unable to secure new contracts on a timely basis and on substantially similar terms if payments due under our contracts are suspended for an extended period of time or if a number of our contracts are renegotiated our remaining performance obligation rpo is comprised of unfilled customer orders for products and product services expected life of contract sales for product services the actual amount and timing of revenues earned may be substantially different than the reported rpo the total dollar amount of the company’s rpo as of december 31 2021 was 236 billion 

the credit risks of having a concentrated customer base in the energy industry could result in losses 

having a concentration of customers in the energy industry may impact our overall exposure to credit risk as our customers may be similarly affected by prolonged changes in economic and industry conditions some of our customers may experience extreme financial distress as a result of falling commodity prices and may be forced to seek protection under applicable bankruptcy laws which may affect our ability to recover any amounts due from such customers furthermore countries that rely heavily upon income from hydrocarbon exports have been and may in the future be negatively and significantly affected by a drop in oil prices which could affect our ability to collect from our customers in these countries particularly national oil companies laws in some jurisdictions in which we will operate could make collection difficult or time consuming we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and do not expect to require collateral in support of our trade receivables while we maintain reserves for potential credit losses we cannot assure such reserves will be sufficient to meet writeoffs of uncollectible receivables or that our losses from such receivables will be consistent with our expectations additionally in the event of a bankruptcy of any of our customers we may be treated as an unsecured creditor and may collect substantially less or none of the amounts owed to us by such customer 

our customers’ activity levels and spending for our products and services and ability to pay amounts owed us could be impacted by the reduction of their cash flow and the ability of our customers to access equity or credit markets 

our customers’ access to capital is dependent on their ability to access the funds necessary to develop economically attractive projects based upon their expectations of future energy prices required investments and resulting returns limited access to external sources of funding has caused and may continue to cause customers to reduce their capital spending plans to levels supported by internally generated cash flow in addition a reduction of cash flow resulting from declines in commodity prices a reduction in borrowing bases under reservebased credit facilities or the lack of available debt or equity financing may impact the ability of our customers to pay amounts owed to us and could cause us to increase our reserve for credit losses 

legal and regulatory risks 

compliance with and changes in laws could be costly and could affect operating results in addition government disruptions could negatively impact our ability to conduct our business 

we conduct business in more than 120 countries that can be impacted by expected and unexpected changes in the legal and business environments in which we operate in particular the shipment of goods services and technology across international borders subjects us to extensive trade laws and regulations our import activities are governed by the unique customs laws and regulations in each of the countries where we operate pursuant to their laws and regulations governments may impose economic sanctions against certain countries persons and 

baker hughes company 2021 form 10k  17 

entities that may restrict or prohibit transactions involving such countries persons and entities which may limit or prevent our conduct of business in certain jurisdictions 

compliancerelated issues could limit our ability to do business in certain countries and impact our earnings or result in investigations leading to fines penalties or other remedial measures changes that could impact the legal environment include new legislation new regulations new policies investigations and legal proceedings and new interpretations of existing legal rules and regulations in particular changes in export control laws or exchange control laws additional restrictions on doing business in countries subject to sanctions and changes in laws in countries where we operate in addition changes and uncertainty in the political environments in which our businesses operate can have a material effect on the laws rules and regulations that affect our operations government disruptions may also delay or halt the granting and renewal of permits licenses and other items required by us and our customers to conduct our business the continued success of our global business and operations depends in part on our ability to continue to anticipate and effectively manage these and other political legal and regulatory risks 

our failure to comply with the foreign corrupt practices act fcpa and other similar laws could have a negative impact on our ongoing operations 

our ability to comply with the fcpa the uk bribery act and various other antibribery and anticorruption laws depends on the success of our ongoing compliance program including our ability to successfully manage our agents distributors and other business partners and supervise train and retain competent employees we could be subject to sanctions and civil and criminal prosecution fines and penalties as well as legal expenses and reputational harm in the event of a finding of a violation of any of these laws by us or any of our employees 

antimoney laundering and antiterrorism financing laws could have adverse consequences for us 

noncompliance with antimoney laundering antiterrorism financing and various other financial laws may subject us to sanctions civil and criminal prosecution fines and penalties as well as legal expenses and potential reputational harm we cannot be sure our programs and controls are or will remain effective to ensure our compliance with all applicable antimoney laundering and antiterrorism financing laws and regulations 

changes in tax laws tax rates tariffs adverse positions taken by taxing authorities and tax audits could impact operating results 

changes in tax laws tax rates tariffs changes in interpretation of tax laws the resolution of tax assessments or audits by various tax authorities and the ability to fully utilize tax loss carryforwards and tax credits could impact our operating results including additional valuation allowances for deferred tax assets 

uninsured claims and litigation against us could adversely impact our operating results 

we could be impacted by the outcome of pending litigation as well as unexpected litigation or proceedings while we have insurance coverage against operating hazards including product liability claims and personal injury claims related to our products to the extent deemed prudent by our management and to the extent insurance is available no assurance can be given that the nature and amount of that insurance will be sufficient to fully indemnify us against liabilities arising out of pending and future claims and litigation 

we may be subject to litigation if another party claims that we have infringed upon misappropriated or otherwise violated its intellectual property rights 

the tools techniques methodologies programs and components we use to provide our products and services may infringe upon misappropriate or otherwise violate the intellectual property rights of others or be challenged on that basis regardless of the merits any such claims may result in significant legal and other costs and may distract management from running our core business resolving such claims could increase our costs including through royalty payments to acquire licenses if available from third parties and through the development of replacement technologies if a license to resolve a claim were not available we might not be able to continue providing a particular service or product which could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

baker hughes company 2021 form 10k  18 

compliance with and rulings and litigation in connection with environmental regulations and the environmental impacts of our operations may adversely affect our business and operating results 

we and our business are subject to extensive domestic and international environmental and safety regulations in addition to environmental and safety regulatory compliance obligations we may face liability arising out of the normal course of business including alleged personal injury or property damage due to exposure of hazardous substances at our current or former facilities our expectations regarding our compliance with environmental laws and regulations and our expenditures to comply with environmental laws and regulations including without limitation our capital expenditures for environmental control equipment are only our forecasts regarding these matters we may be impacted by material changes in environmental and safety regulations or subject to substantial liability for environmental impacts our compliance cost forecasts may be substantially different from actual results which may be affected by factors such as changes in law that impose restrictions on air or other emissions wastewater management waste disposal hydraulic fracturing or wetland and land use practices more stringent enforcement of existing environmental laws and regulations a change in our share of any remediation costs or other unexpected adverse outcomes with respect to sites where we have been named as a potentially responsible party including without limitation superfund sites the discovery of other sites or discovery of additional issues at existing sites where additional expenditures may be required to comply with environmental legal obligations and the accidental discharge of hazardous materials 

investor and public perception related to the company’s environment social and governance esg performance as well as current and future esg reporting requirements may affect our business and our operating results 

increasing focus on esg factors has led to enhanced interest in and review of performance results by investors and other stakeholders and the potential for litigation and reputational risk regulatory requirements related to esg or sustainability reporting have been issued in the european union that apply to financial market participants with implementation and enforcement having started in 2021 in the us such regulations have been issued related to pension investments in california and for the responsible investment of public funds in illinois additional regulation is pending in other states we may be affected by our ability to meet evolving and expanding emissions reporting requirements and by investor and public perception of our reporting and performance related to voluntary climate standards we expect regulatory requirements related to esg matters to continue to expand globally we are committed to transparent and comprehensive reporting of our sustainability performance and report under standards such as the global reporting initiative’s g4 guidelines the sustainability accounting standards board’s documentation and recommendations issued by the financial stability boards task force for climaterelated financial disclosures if we are not able to meet future sustainability reporting requirements of regulators or current and future expectations of investors customers or other stakeholders our business and ability to raise capital may be adversely affected 

international national and state governments and agencies continue to evaluate and promulgate legislation and regulations that are focused on reducing greenhouse gas ghg emissions compliance with ghg emission regulations applicable to our or our customers operations may have significant implications that could adversely affect our business and operating results in the fossilfuel sectors and boosting demand for technologies contributing to the reduction of ghg emissions 

in the united states the us environmental protection agency epa has taken steps to regulate ghg emissions as air pollutants under the us clean air act of 1970 as amended the epa’s greenhouse gas reporting rule requires monitoring and reporting of ghg emissions from among others certain mobile and stationary ghg emission sources in the oil and natural gas industry which in turn may include data from our equipment or operations in addition the us government has proposed rules in the past setting ghg emission standards for or otherwise aimed at reducing ghg emissions from the oil and natural gas industry 

caps or fees on carbon emissions including in the us have been and may continue to be established and the cost of such caps or fees could disproportionately affect the fossilfuel sectors we are unable to predict whether and when the proposed changes in laws or regulations ultimately will occur or what they ultimately will require and accordingly we are unable to assess the potential financial or operational impact they may have on our business 

other developments focused on restricting ghg emissions include the united nations framework convention on climate change which includes implementation of the paris agreement and the kyoto protocol by the 

baker hughes company 2021 form 10k  19 

signatories the glasgow climate pact the european union emission trading system article 8 of the european union energy efficiency directive and the united kingdom’s streamlined energy and carbon reporting secr the european commission’s proposed carbon border adjustment mechanism cbam and in the us the regional greenhouse gas initiative the western climate action initiative and various state programs implementing the california global warming solutions act of 2006 known as assembly bill 32 

requirements and voluntary initiatives to reduce greenhouse gas emissions as well as increased climate change awareness may result in increased costs for the oil and gas industry to curb greenhouse gas emissions and could have an adverse impact on demand for oil and natural gas 

international national and state governments agencies and bodies continue to evaluate and promulgate regulations and voluntary initiatives that are focused on reducing ghg emissions these requirements and initiatives are likely to become more stringent over time and to result in increased costs for the oil and gas industry to reduce ghg emissions in addition these developments and public perception relating to climate change may curtail production and demand for hydrocarbons such as oil and natural gas by shifting demand towards an investment in relatively lower carbon emitting energy sources and alternative energy solutions if for example renewable energy becomes more competitive than fossilfuel energy globally it could have a material effect on our results of operations 

the potential for physical effects of climate change may pose future risks to our operations and those of our customers 

physical climate change effects can include extreme variability in weather patterns such as increased frequency and severity of significant weather events eg flooding hurricanes and tropical storms natural hazards eg increased wildfire risk rising mean temperature and sea levels and longterm changes in precipitation patterns eg drought desertification or poor water quality such effects have the potential to affect business continuity and operating results particularly at facilities in coastal areas or areas prone to chronic water scarcity 

changes in laws or regulations relating to data privacy and security or any actual or perceived failure by us to comply with such laws or regulations or contractual or other obligations relating to data privacy or security may adversely affect our business and operating results 

we may have access to sensitive confidential proprietary or personal data or information in certain of our businesses that is or may become subject to various data privacy and security laws regulations standards contractual obligations or customerimposed controls in the jurisdictions in which we operate the legal and regulatory environment related to data privacy and security is increasingly rigorous with new and constantly changing requirements applicable to our business and enforcement practices are likely to remain uncertain for the foreseeable future these laws and regulations may be interpreted and applied differently over time and from jurisdiction to jurisdiction and it is possible that they will be interpreted and applied in ways that may adversely affect our business and operating results 

in the us various federal and state regulators including governmental agencies like the federal trade commission have adopted or are considering adopting laws regulations and standards concerning personal information and data security internationally laws regulations and standards in many jurisdictions apply broadly to the collection use retention security disclosure transfer and other processing of personal information or other data these various and evolving federal state and international laws regulations and standards can differ significantly from one another and given our global footprint this may significantly complicate our compliance efforts and impose considerable costs such as costs related to organizational changes and implementing additional protection technologies which are likely to increase over time in addition compliance with applicable requirements may require us to modify our data processing practices and policies distract management or divert resources from other initiatives and projects all of which could adversely affect our business and operating results any failure or perceived failure by us to comply with any applicable federal state or international laws regulations standards or contractual or other obligations relating to data privacy and security could result in damage to our reputation and our relationship with our customers as well as proceedings or litigation by governmental agencies customers or individuals which could subject us to significant fines sanctions awards penalties or judgments all of which could adversely affect our business and operating results 

baker hughes company 2021 form 10k  20 

technology risks 

an inability to obtain maintain protect or enforce our intellectual property rights could adversely affect our business 

there can be no assurance that the steps we take to obtain maintain protect and enforce our intellectual property rights will be completely adequate our intellectual property rights may fail to provide us with significant competitive advantages particularly in foreign jurisdictions where we have not invested in an intellectual property portfolio or that do not have or do not enforce strong intellectual property rights the weakening of protection of our trademarks patents and other intellectual property rights could also adversely affect our business 

we are a party to a number of licenses that give us rights to intellectual property that is necessary or useful to our business our success depends in part on the ability of our licensors to obtain maintain protect and sufficiently enforce the licensed intellectual property rights we have commercialized without protection for the intellectual property rights we license other companies might be able to offer substantially identical products for sale which could adversely affect our competitive business position and harm our business products also there can be no assurances that we will be able to obtain or renew from third parties the licenses to use intellectual property rights we need in the future and there is no assurance that such licenses can be obtained on reasonable terms we would be adversely affected in the event that any such license agreement was terminated without the right for us to continue using the licensed intellectual property 

increased cybersecurity vulnerabilities and threats and more sophisticated and targeted cyber attacks and other security incidents pose risks to our systems data and business and our relationships with customers and other third parties 

in the course of conducting our business we may hold or have access to sensitive confidential proprietary or personal data or information belonging to us our employees or third parties including customers partners or suppliers increased cybersecurity vulnerabilities and threats and more sophisticated and targeted cyber attacks and other security incidents pose risks to our and our customers’ partners’ suppliers’ and thirdparty service providers’ systems data and business and the confidentiality availability and integrity of our and our employees’ and customers’ data while we attempt to mitigate these risks we remain vulnerable to cyber attacks and other security incidents including ransomware incidences given our global footprint the large number of customers partners suppliers and service providers with which we do business and the increasing sophistication and complexity of cyber attacks a cyber attack could occur and persist for an extended period without detection any investigation of a cyber attack or other security incident would be inherently unpredictable and it would take time before the completion of any investigation and before there is availability of full and reliable information during such time we would not necessarily know the extent of the harm or how best to remediate it and certain errors or actions could be repeated or compounded before they are discovered and remediated all or any of which would further increase the costs and consequences of a cyber attack or other security incident we may be required to expend significant resources to protect against respond to and recover from any cyber attacks and other security incidents as cyber attacks continue to evolve we may be required to expend significant additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our protective measures or to investigate and remediate any information security vulnerabilities in addition our remediation efforts may not be successful the inability to implement maintain and upgrade adequate safeguards could materially and adversely affect our results of operations cash flows and financial condition 

in addition to our own systems we use thirdparty service providers who in turn may also use thirdparty providers to process certain data or information on our behalf due to applicable laws and regulations or contractual obligations we may be held responsible for cybersecurity incidents attributed to our service providers to the extent affecting information we share with them although we contractually require these service providers to implement and maintain reasonable security measures we cannot control third parties and cannot guarantee that a security breach will not occur in their systems

industry and market risks 

volatility of oil and natural gas prices can adversely affect demand for our products and services 

prices of oil and gas products are set on a commodity basis as a result the volatility in oil and natural gas prices can impact our customers’ activity levels and spending for our products and services current energy prices are important contributors to cash flow for our customers and their ability to fund exploration and development activities expectations about future prices and price volatility are important for determining future spending levels 

demand for oil and natural gas is subject to factors beyond our control which may adversely affect our operating results changes in the global economy could impact our customers’ spending levels and our revenue and operating results 

demand for oil and natural gas as well as the demand for our services and products is highly correlated with global economic growth a prolonged reduction in oil and natural gas prices may require us to record additional asset impairments such a potential impairment charge could have a material adverse impact on our operating results 

supply of oil and natural gas is subject to factors beyond our control which may adversely affect our operating results 

productive capacity for oil and natural gas is dependent on our customers’ decisions to develop and produce oil and natural gas reserves and on the regulatory environment in which our customers and we operate the ability to produce oil and natural gas can be affected by the number and productivity of new wells drilled and completed as well as the rate of production and resulting depletion of existing wells 

currency fluctuations or devaluations may impact our operating results 

fluctuations or devaluations in foreign currencies relative to the us dollar can impact our revenue and our costs of doing business as well as the costs of doing business of our customers 

changes in economic andor market conditions may impact our ability to borrow andor cost of borrowing 

the condition of the capital markets and equity markets in general may affect the price of our common stock and our ability to obtain financing if necessary if our credit rating is downgraded it could increase borrowing costs under credit facilities and commercial paper programs as well as increase the cost of renewing or obtaining or make it more difficult to renew obtain or issue new debt financing

executive summary 

we are an energy technology company with a broad and diversified portfolio of technologies and services that span the energy and industrial value chain we operate through our four business segments oilfield services ofs oilfield equipment ofe turbomachinery  process solutions tps and digital solutions ds we sell products and services primarily in the global oil and gas markets within the upstream midstream and downstream segments 

as we reflect on the macro environment in 2021 the global economy continued to recover from the impact of the covid19 global pandemic the oil markets experienced increasing levels of demand and continued restraints on supply translating into a strong oil price recovery for natural gas a combination of demand and supply factors converged pushing natural gas and lng prices to record levels in both europe and in asia the natural gas price spikes also highlighted the fragility of the global energy system as the world transitions to net zero emissions the effects from variant strains of the covid19 virus continued to impact operations in the form of global chip shortages supply chain challenges and inflationary pressures in multiple parts of the world 

as we look ahead to 2022 we expect global economic growth to remain strong however growth rates are likely to moderate from 2021 levels as central banks are expected to begin tightening monetary policy in order to quell growing inflationary pressures despite the expected slowdown in the pace of growth we believe the expected continuing broader macro recovery will translate into rising energy demand in 2022 with oil demand likely recovering to prepandemic levels by the end of the year we expect continued momentum in the global natural gas markets in 2022 building on a strong 2021 our positive longterm view on gas is also supported by the recent improvements in policy sentiment in certain parts of the world towards natural gas’ broader role within the energy transition 

outside of the oil and gas industry the focus on cleaner energy sources and technology to lower carbon emissions from resourceintensive industries continues to accelerate in the us europe and asia various renewables and green and blue hydrogen projects are moving forward as well as a number of ccus projects on the new energy front we were active this year in pursuing earlystage technologies in ccus and in hydrogen in ccus we acquired a position in electrochaea a biomethanation company and also entered into an exclusive license with sri international for mixedsalt process technology in hydrogen we made an investment in ekona a growth stage company developing novel turquoise hydrogen production technology as well as nemesys a technology company focused on a range of earlystage hydrogen technologies 

on the industrial front we completed the acquisition of arms reliability and an investment in augury which will help baker hughes continue to build out its industrial asset management platform and deliver an expanded set of asset performance capabilities 

baker hughes was successful on many fronts in 2021 with key commercial successes and developments in the lng and new energy markets solid margin improvements as well as strong cash flows from operating activities and free cash flow a nongaap measure defined as cash flows from operating activities less expenditures for capital assets plus the proceeds from disposal of assets our strong cash flow performance provides our company ample flexibility and optionality for our broader capital allocation strategy as evidence of this we returned almost 12 billion back to shareholders through dividends and buybacks in 2021 while also making multiple acquisitions and investments across the industrial and new energy spaces 

baker hughes company 2021 form 10k  28 

in 2021 we generated revenue of 205 billion compared to 207 billion in 2020 the decrease in revenue was primarily driven by lower volume in ofs and ofe partially offset by higher volume in tps and ds income before income taxes was 428 million in 2021 and included restructuring impairment and other charges of 209 million separation related costs of 60 million a loss of 1085 million related to our investment in c3 ai partially offset by a gain of 241 million related to our investment in adnoc drilling both recorded in other nonoperating incomeloss loss before income taxes was 152 billion in 2020 and included goodwill impairment charges of 148 billion restructuring impairment and other charges of 19 billion inventory impairment charges of 246 million separation related costs of 134 million and a gain of 14 billion related to our investment in c3 ai recorded in other nonoperating income 

outlook 

our business is exposed to a number of macro factors which influence our outlook and expectations given the current volatile conditions in the industry all of our outlook expectations are purely based on the market as we see it today and are subject to changing conditions in the industry 

• north america onshore activity we expect north american onshore to experience strong growth in 2022 as compared to 2021 should commodity prices remain at current levels 

• international onshore activity we expect onshore spending outside of north america to continue to improve in 2022 as compared to 2021 should commodity prices remain at current levels 

• offshore projects we expect a modest recovery in offshore activity and the number of subsea tree awards to grow in 2022 as compared to 2021 

• lng projects we remain optimistic on the lng market long term and view natural gas as both a transition and a destination fuel we continue to view the longterm economics of the lng industry as positive 

we have other segments in our portfolio that are more correlated with various industrial metrics including global gdp growth such as our digital solutions segment 

we also have businesses within our portfolio that are exposed to new energy solutions specifically focused around reducing carbon emissions of energy and broader industry including hydrogen geothermal ccus and energy storage we expect to see continued growth in these businesses as new energy solutions become a more prevalent part of the broader energy mix 

overall we believe our portfolio is well positioned to compete across the energy value chain and deliver comprehensive solutions for our customers we remain optimistic about the longterm economics of the oil and gas industry but we are continuing to operate with flexibility over time we believe the world’s demand for energy will continue to rise and that hydrocarbons will play a major role in meeting the worlds energy needs for the foreseeable future as such we remain focused on delivering innovative lowemission and costeffective solutions that deliver step changes in operating and economic performance for our customers

business environment 

the following discussion and analysis summarizes the significant factors affecting our results of operations financial condition and liquidity position as of and for the year ended december 31 2021 and 2020 and should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes of the company 

our revenue is predominately generated from the sale of products and services to major national and independent oil and natural gas companies worldwide and is dependent on spending by our customers for oil and natural gas exploration field development and production this spending is driven by a number of factors including our customers forecasts of future energy demand and supply their access to resources to develop and produce oil and natural gas their ability to fund their capital programs the impact of new government regulations and most importantly their expectations for oil and natural gas prices as a key driver of their cash flows 

oil and natural gas prices 

oil and natural gas prices are summarized in the table below as averages of the daily closing prices during each of the periods indicated 



1 energy information administration eia europe brent spot price per barrel 

2 eia cushing ok wti west texas intermediate spot price 

3 eia henry hub natural gas spot price per million british thermal unit 

after a volatile year in 2020 when oil prices dropped due to lower demand the combination of demand and supply in 2021 resulted in higher oil prices and raised natural gas and lng prices to record breaking levels 

outside north america customer spending is most heavily influenced by brent oil prices the average brent oil prices increased to 7086bbl in 2021 from 4196bbl in 2020 and ranged from a low of 5037bbl in january 2021 to a high of 8576bbl in october 2021 

in north america customer spending is highly driven by wti oil prices which similarly to brent oil prices on average increased to 6814bbl in 2021 from 3916bbl in 2020 and ranged from a low of 4747bbl in january 2021 to a high of 8564bbl in october 2021 

in north america natural gas prices as measured by the henry hub natural gas spot price averaged 389mmbtu in 2021 representing a 92 increase over the prior year throughout the year henry hub natural gas spot prices ranged from a high of 2386mmbtu in february 2021 to a low of 243mmbtu in april 2021 according to the us department of energy working natural gas in storage at the end of 2021 was 3226 billion cubic feet bcf which was 68 or 234 bcf below the corresponding week in 2020

baker hughes rig count 

the baker hughes rig counts are an important business barometer for the drilling industry and its suppliers when drilling rigs are active they consume products and services produced by the oil service industry rig count trends are driven by the exploration and development spending by oil and natural gas companies which in turn is influenced by current and future price expectations for oil and natural gas the counts may reflect the relative strength and stability of energy prices and overall market activity however these counts should not be solely relied on as other specific and pervasive conditions may exist that affect overall energy prices and market activity 

we have been providing rig counts to the public since 1944 we gather all relevant data through our field service personnel who obtain the necessary data from routine visits to the various rigs customers contractors and other outside sources as necessary we base the classification of a well as either oil or natural gas primarily upon filings made by operators in the relevant jurisdiction this data is then compiled and distributed to various wire services and trade associations and is published on our website we believe the counting process and resulting data is reliable however it is subject to our ability to obtain accurate and timely information rig counts are compiled weekly for the us and canada and monthly for all international rigs published international rig counts do not include rigs drilling in certain locations such as russia the caspian region and onshore china because this information is not readily available 

rigs in the us and canada are counted as active if on the day the count is taken the well being drilled has been started but drilling has not been completed and the well is anticipated to be of sufficient depth to be a potential consumer of our drill bits in international areas rigs are counted on a weekly basis and deemed active if drilling activities occurred during the majority of the week the weekly results are then averaged for the month and published accordingly the rig count does not include rigs that are in transit from one location to another rigging up being used in nondrilling activities including production testing completion and workover and are not expected to be significant consumers of drill bits 

the rig counts are summarized in the table below as averages for each of the periods indicated 



2021 compared to 2020 

overall the rig count was 1366 in 2021 an increase of 1 as compared to 2020 due primarily to an increase in activity in north america partially offset by declines internationally the rig count in north america increased 17 and the international rig count decreased 9 in 2021 compared to 2020 

within north america the increase was primarily driven by the canadian rig count which was up 48 on average when compared to the same period last year and an increase in the us rig count which was up 10 on average internationally the decrease in the rig count was driven primarily by decreases in the middle east region africa region and europe region of 21 10 and 10 respectively 

results of operations 

the discussions below relating to significant line items from our consolidated statements of income loss are based on available information and represent our analysis of significant changes or events that impact the comparability of reported amounts where appropriate we have identified specific events and changes that affect comparability or trends and where reasonably practicable have quantified the impact of such items in addition the discussions below for revenue and cost of revenue are on a total basis as the business drivers for product sales and services are similar all dollar amounts in tabulations in this section are in millions of dollars unless otherwise stated certain columns and rows may not add due to the use of rounded numbers 

our results of operations are evaluated by the chief executive officer on a consolidated basis as well as at the segment level the performance of our operating segments is evaluated based on segment operating income 

baker hughes company 2021 form 10k  31 

loss which is defined as income loss before income taxes and before the following net interest expense net other nonoperating income loss corporate expenses restructuring impairment and other charges goodwill and inventory impairments separationrelated costs and certain gains and losses not allocated to the operating segments 

in evaluating the segment performance the company uses the following 

volume volume is the increase or decrease in products andor services sold periodoverperiod excluding the impact of foreign exchange and price the volume impact on profit is calculated by multiplying the prior period profit rate by the change in revenue volume between the current and prior period it also includes price defined as the change in sales price for a comparable product or service periodoverperiod and is calculated as the periodoverperiod change in sales prices of comparable products and services 

foreign exchange fx fx measures the translational foreign exchange impact or the translation impact of the periodoverperiod change on sales and costs directly attributable to change in the foreign exchange rate compared to the us dollar fx impact is calculated by multiplying the functional currency amounts revenue or profit with the periodoverperiod fx rate variance using the average exchange rate for the respective period 

inflationdeflation inflationdeflation is defined as the increase or decrease in direct and indirect costs of the same type for an equal amount of volume it is calculated as the yearoveryear change in cost ie price paid of direct material compensation and benefits and overhead costs 

productivity productivity is measured by the remaining variance in profit after adjusting for the periodoverperiod impact of volume and price foreign exchange and inflationdeflation as defined above improved or lower periodoverperiod cost productivity is the result of cost efficiencies or inefficiencies such as cost decreasing or increasing more than volume or cost increasing or decreasing less than volume or changes in sales mix among segments this also includes the periodoverperiod variance of transactional foreign exchange aside from those foreign currency devaluations that are reported separately for business evaluation purposes 

orders and remaining performance obligations 

our statement of income loss displays sales and costs of sales in accordance with sec regulations under which “goods” is required to include all sales of tangible products and “services” must include all other sales including other services activities for the amounts shown below we distinguish between “equipment” and “product services” where product services refers to sales under product services agreements including sales of both goods such as spare parts and equipment upgrades and related services such as monitoring maintenance and repairs which is an important part of our operations we refer to “product services” simply as “services” within management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

orders  we recognized orders of 217 billion and 207 billion in 2021 and 2020 respectively in 2021 equipment orders were up 3 and service orders were up 6 compared to 2020 

remaining performance obligations rpo as of december 31 2021 and 2020 the aggregate amount of the transaction price allocated to the unsatisfied or partially unsatisfied performance obligations was 236 billion and 234 billion respectively

in 2021 we incurred net interest expense of 299 million an increase of 35 million from the prior year primarily driven by higher interest expense mainly related to 28 million of costs associated with the refinancing of our senior notes due december 2022 and lower interest income 

income taxes 

in 2021 our income tax expense was 758 million an increase of 199 million from 559 million in 2020 the increase was primarily due to tax expense related to unrecognized tax benefits and the geographical mix of earnings our 2021 income tax expense includes 121 million that is recoverable as it relates to liabilities indemnified under the tax matters agreement with ge this tax expense has an offset in the other nonoperating income loss net caption in our consolidated statements of income loss

liquidity and capital resources 

our objective in financing our business is to maintain sufficient liquidity adequate financial resources and financial flexibility in order to fund the requirements of our business despite the challenging dynamics that began in 2020 as a result of the covid19 pandemic we continue to maintain solid financial strength and liquidity at december 31 2021 we had cash and cash equivalents of 39 billion compared to 41 billion at december 31 2020 our liquidity is further supported by a revolving credit facility of 3 billion and access to both commercial paper and uncommitted lines of credit at december 31 2021 we had no borrowings outstanding under the revolving credit facility our commercial paper program or our uncommitted lines of credit our next debt maturity is december 2023 

baker hughes company 2021 form 10k  36 

we held cash and cash equivalents in the us of approximately 16 billion and 10 billion and outside the us of approximately 22 billion and 31 billion as of december 31 2021 and 2020 respectively a substantial portion of the cash held outside the us at december 31 2021 has been reinvested in active nonus business operations if we decide at a later date to repatriate those funds to the us we may incur other additional taxes that would not be significant to the total tax provision 

we have a 3 billion committed unsecured revolving credit facility the credit agreement with commercial banks maturing in december 2024 the credit agreement contains certain customary representations and warranties certain customary affirmative covenants and certain customary negative covenants upon the occurrence of certain events of default our obligations under the credit agreement may be accelerated such events of default include payment defaults to lenders under the credit agreement and other customary defaults no such events of default have occurred we have no borrowings under the credit agreement 

in addition we have a commercial paper program under which we may issue from time to time commercial paper with maturities of no more than 397 days as a result of the repayment of £600 million of our commercial paper on april 30 2021 originally issued in may of 2020 under the covid corporate financing facility established by the bank of england our authorized commercial paper program was reduced from 38 billion to 3 billion 

certain senior notes contain covenants that restrict our ability to take certain actions see note 10 borrowings of the notes to consolidated financial statements in this annual report for further details at december 31 2021 we were in compliance with all debt covenants 

we continuously review our liquidity and capital resources if market conditions were to change for instance due to the uncertainty created by a global pandemic or a significant decline in oil and gas prices and our revenue was reduced significantly or operating costs were to increase significantly our cash flows and liquidity could be negatively impacted additionally it could cause the rating agencies to lower our credit ratings there are no ratings triggers that would accelerate the maturity of any borrowings under our committed credit facility however a downgrade in our credit ratings could increase the cost of borrowings under the credit facility and could also limit or preclude our ability to issue commercial paper should this occur we could seek alternative sources of funding including borrowing under the credit facility 

during the year ended december 31 2021 we dispersed cash to fund a variety of activities including certain working capital needs restructuring and ge separation related costs capital expenditures the payment of dividends distributions to noncontrolling interests repayment of debt and repurchases of our common stock 

cash flows 

cash flows provided by used in each type of activity were as follows for the years ended december 31 



fiscal year 2021 to fiscal year 2020 

operating activities

investing activities 

cash flows from investing activities used cash of 463 million and 618 million for the years ended december 31 2021 and 2020 respectively 

our principal recurring investing activity is the funding of capital expenditures to ensure that we have the appropriate levels and types of machinery and equipment in place to generate revenue from operations expenditures for capital assets totaled 856 million and 974 million for 2021 and 2020 respectively partially offset by cash flows from the sale of property plant and equipment of 315 million and 187 million in 2021 and 2020 respectively proceeds from the disposal of assets related to equipment that was lostinhole and to property machinery and equipment no longer used in operations that was sold throughout the period

we invested 179 million during 2021 in adding capabilities to our new energy and industrial asset management offerings through the acquisition of business interests in augury ekona power and electrochaea among others 

in 2021 we sold approximately 22 million shares of c3 ai class a common stock and received proceeds of 145 million which is reported as other investing activity 

financing activities 

cash flows from financing activities used cash of 2143 million and generated cash of 225 million for the years ended december 31 2021 and 2020 respectively 

we had net repayments of shortterm debt of 41 million and 204 million and longterm debt of 1313 million and 42 million in 2021 and 2020 respectively the repayment of longterm debt in 2021 was primarily driven by the early repayment of our 2773 senior notes due december 2022 the 2022 notes with a principal amount of 1250 million in addition a charge of 28 million related to the early redemption was recorded within interest expense net in our consolidated statement of income loss 

in december 2021 we received proceeds from the issuance of 650 million aggregate principal amount of 1231 senior notes due december 2023 and 600 million aggregate principal amount of 2061 senior notes due december 2026 in 2020 we had proceeds from the issuance of 500 million aggregate principal amount of 4486 senior notes due may 2030

baker hughes company 2021 form 10k  38 

on july 30 2021 our board of directors authorized each of the company and bhh llc to repurchase up to 2 billion of its class a common stock and llc units respectively during 2021 the company and bhh llc repurchased and canceled 176 million shares of class a common stock and llc units respectively for a total of 434 million 

cash requirements 

we believe cash on hand cash flows from operating activities the available revolving credit facility access to both our commercial paper program or our uncommitted lines of credit and availability under our existing shelf registrations of debt will provide us with sufficient capital resources and liquidity in the shortterm and longterm to manage our working capital needs meet contractual obligations fund capital expenditures and dividends repay debt repurchase our common stock and support the development of our shortterm and longterm operating strategies when necessary we issue commercial paper or other shortterm debt to fund cash needs in the us in excess of the cash generated in the us 

our capital expenditures can be adjusted and managed by us to match market demand and activity levels based on current market conditions capital expenditures in 2022 will be made at a rate that we estimate would equal up to 5 of annual revenue the expenditures are expected to be used primarily for normal recurring items necessary to support our business we also anticipate making income tax payments in the range of 550 million to 650 million in 2022 

contractual obligations and commitments 

our material cash commitments from known contractual and other obligations consist primarily of obligations for longterm debt and related interest leases for property and equipment and purchase obligations as part of normal operations certain amounts included in our contractual obligations as of december 31 2021 are based on our estimates and assumptions about these obligations including their duration anticipated actions by third parties and other factors 

see “note 10 borrowings” of the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 herein for information regarding scheduled maturities of our longterm debt see “note 9 leases” of the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 herein for information regarding scheduled maturities of our operating leases 

as of december 31 2021 we had expected cash payments for estimated interest on our longterm debt and finance lease obligations of 242 million payable within the next twelve months and 3141 million payable thereafter 

as of december 31 2021 we had purchase obligations of 1304 million payable within the next twelve months and 397 million payable thereafter our purchase obligations include expenditures for capital assets for 2022 as well as agreements to purchase goods or services or licenses that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased fixed minimum or variable price provisions and the approximate timing of the transaction 

due to the uncertainty with respect to the timing of potential future cash outflows associated with our uncertain tax positions we are unable to make reasonable estimates of the period of cash settlement if any to the respective taxing authorities therefore 733 million in uncertain tax positions including interest and penalties have been excluded from the contractual obligations discussed above see note 12 income taxes of the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 herein for further information 

other factors affecting liquidity 

registration statements  in may 2021 baker hughes filed a universal automatic shelf registration statement on form s3asr with the sec to have the ability to sell various types of securities including debt securities class a common stock preferred stock guarantees of debt securities purchase contracts and units the specific terms of any securities to be sold would be described in supplemental filings with the sec the registration statement will expire in may 2024 

baker hughes company 2021 form 10k  39 

in december 2020 bhh llc baker hughes netherlands funding company bv and baker hughes coobligor inc filed a shelf registration statement on form s3 with the sec to have the ability to sell up to 3 billion in debt securities in amounts to be determined at the time of an offering any such offering if it does occur may happen in one or more transactions the specific terms of any debt securities to be sold would be described in supplemental filings with the sec the registration statement will expire in december 2023 

customer receivables  in line with industry practice we may bill our customers for services provided in arrears dependent upon contractual terms in a challenging economic environment we may experience delays in the payment of our invoices due to customers lower cash flow from operations or their more limited access to credit markets while historically there have not been material nonpayment events we attempt to mitigate this risk through working with our customers to restructure their debts a customers failure or delay in payment could have a material adverse effect on our shortterm liquidity and results from operations as of december 31 2021 13 of our gross customer receivables were from customers in the us and 12 were from customers in mexico as of december 31 2020 16 of our gross customer receivables were from customers in the us no other country accounted for more than 10 of our gross customer receivables at these dates 

international operations  our cash that is held outside the us is 57 of the total cash balance as of december 31 2021 we may not be able to use this cash quickly and efficiently due to exchange or cash controls that could make it challenging as a result our cash balance may not represent our ability to quickly and efficiently use this cash 

supply chain finance programs  under supply chain finance programs administered by a third party our suppliers are given the opportunity to sell receivables from us to participating financial institutions at their sole discretion at a rate that leverages our credit rating and thus might be more beneficial to our suppliers our responsibility is limited to making payment on the terms originally negotiated with our supplier regardless of whether the supplier sells its receivable to a financial institution the range of payment terms we negotiate with our suppliers is consistent irrespective of whether a supplier participates in the program these liabilities continue to be presented as accounts payable in our consolidated statements of financial position and reflected as cash flow from operating activities when settled we do not believe that changes in the availability of supply chain financing programs would have a material impact on our liquidity 

critical accounting estimates 

an accounting policy is deemed to be critical if the nature of the estimate or assumption it incorporates is subject to a material level of judgment related to matters that are highly uncertain and changes in those estimates and assumptions are reasonably likely to materially impact our consolidated financial statements these estimates reflect our best judgment about current and for some estimates future economic and market conditions and their potential effects based on information available as of the date of these financial statements if these conditions change from those expected it is reasonably possible that the judgments and estimates described below could change which may result in future impairments of goodwill or the establishment of valuation allowances on deferred tax assets and increased tax liabilities among other effects also see note 1 summary of significant accounting policies of the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 herein which discusses our most significant accounting policies 

the audit committee of our board of directors has reviewed our critical accounting estimates and the disclosure presented below during the past three fiscal years we have not made any material changes in the methodology used to establish the critical accounting estimates and we believe that the following are the critical accounting estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements for the year ended december 31 2021 there are other items within our consolidated financial statements that require estimation and judgment but they are not deemed critical as defined above 

revenue recognition on longterm product services agreements 

we have longterm service agreements with our customers predominately within our tps segment these agreements typically require us to maintain assets sold to the customer over a defined contract term these agreements have average contract terms of greater than 10 years from time to time these contract terms may be extended through contract modifications or amendments which may result in revisions to future billing and cost 

baker hughes company 2021 form 10k  40 

estimates revenue recognition on longterm product services agreements requires estimates of both customer payments and the costs to perform required maintenance services over the contract term we recognize revenue on an overtime basis using input method to measure our progress toward completion at the estimated margin rate of the contract 

to develop our billings estimates we consider the number of billable events that will occur based on estimated utilization of the asset under contract over the life of the contract term this estimated utilization will consider both historical and market conditions asset retirements and new product introductions if applicable 

to develop our cost estimates we consider the timing and extent of maintenance and overhaul events including the amount and cost of labor spare parts and other resources required to perform the services in developing our cost estimates we utilize a combination of our historical cost experience and expected cost improvements cost improvements are only included in future cost estimates after savings have been observed in actual results or proven effective through an extensive regulatory or engineering approval process 

we routinely review the estimates used in our product services agreements and regularly revise them to adjust for changes these revisions are based on objectively verifiable information that is available at the time of the review 

the difference between the timing of our revenue recognition and cash received from our customers results in either a contract asset revenue in excess of billings or a contract liability billings in excess of revenue see note 7 contract and other deferred assets and note 8 progress collections and deferred income of the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 herein for further information 

we regularly assess customer credit risk inherent in the carrying amounts of receivables and contract assets and estimated earnings including the risk that contractual penalties may not be sufficient to offset our accumulated investment in the event of customer termination we gain insight into expected future utilization and cost trends as well as credit risk through our knowledge of the equipment installed and the close interaction with our customers through supplying critical services and parts over extended periods revisions to cost or billing estimates may affect a product services agreement’s total estimated profitability resulting in an adjustment of earnings such adjustments generated earnings of 14 million 17 million and 1 million for the three years ended december 31 2021 2020 and 2019 respectively we provide for probable losses when they become evident 

on december 31 2021 our longterm product service agreements net of related billings in excess of revenues of 03 billion represent approximately 26 of our total estimated life of contract billings of 101 billion cash billings collected on these contracts were approximately 06 billion during the years ended december 31 2021 and 2020 our contracts on average are approximately 26 complete based on costs incurred to date and our estimate of future costs revisions to our estimates of future revenue or costs that increase or decrease total estimated contract profitability by 1 would increase or decrease the longterm product service agreements balance by 006 billion 

goodwill and other identified intangible assets 

we perform an annual impairment test of goodwill on a qualitative or quantitative basis for each of our reporting units as of july 1 or more frequently when circumstances indicate an impairment may exist at the reporting unit level when performing the annual impairment test we have the option of first performing a qualitative assessment to determine the existence of events and circumstances that would lead to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount if such a conclusion is reached we would then be required to perform a quantitative impairment assessment of goodwill a quantitative assessment for the determination of impairment is made by comparing the carrying amount of each reporting unit with its fair value determining the fair value of a reporting unit is judgmental in nature and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions and typically requires analysis of discounted cash flows and other market information such as trading multiples and comparable transactions cash flow analysis requires judgment regarding many factors such as management’s projections of future cash flows weightedaverage cost of capital and longterm growth rates market information requires judgmental selection of relevant market comparables we assess the valuation methodology based upon the relevance and availability of the data at the time the valuation is performed our estimates are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable but which are inherently uncertain and actual 

baker hughes company 2021 form 10k  41 

results may differ from those assumed in our analysis the determination of whether goodwill is impaired involves a significant level of judgment in these assumptions and changes in our forecasts business strategy government regulations or economic or market conditions could significantly impact these judgments potentially decreasing the fair value of one or more reporting units any resulting impairment charges could have a material impact on our results of operations 

income taxes 

our effective tax rate is based on our income statutory tax rates and differences between tax laws and us gaap in various jurisdictions tax laws are complex and subject to different interpretations by the taxpayer and respective governmental taxing authorities our rate may be further impacted by the repatriation of foreign earnings that are considered indefinitely reinvested to the extent the repatriation would result in additional taxes such as withholding and income taxes indefinite reinvestment is determined by management’s judgment and intentions concerning the future operations of the company in cases where repatriation would otherwise incur significant withholding or income taxes these foreign earnings have been indefinitely reinvested in active nonus business operations computation of the potential deferred tax liability associated with these undistributed earnings and any other basis differences is not practicable 

deferred income tax assets represent amounts available to reduce income taxes payable in future years we evaluate the recoverability of these future tax deductions and credits by assessing the adequacy of future taxable income from all sources including reversal of taxable temporary differences forecasted operating earnings and available tax planning strategies these sources of income rely heavily on estimates we use our historical experience and short and long range business forecasts to provide insight we record a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 

our tax filings routinely are subject to audit by the tax authorities in the jurisdictions where we conduct business these audits may result in assessments of additional taxes that are resolved with the tax authorities or through the courts we have provided for the amounts we believe will ultimately result from these proceedings but settlements of issues raised in these audits may affect our tax rate we have 531 million of gross unrecognized tax benefits excluding interest and penalties at december 31 2021 we are not able to reasonably estimate in which future periods these amounts ultimately will be settled 

allowance for credit losses 

the estimation of anticipated credit losses that may be incurred as we work through the invoice collection process with our customers requires us to make judgments and estimates regarding our customers ability to pay amounts due to us we monitor our customers payment history and current credit worthiness to determine that collectability is reasonably assured we also consider the overall business climate in which our customers operate for accounts receivable a loss allowance matrix is utilized to measure lifetime expected credit losses the matrix contemplates historical credit losses by age of receivables adjusted for any forwardlooking information and management expectations at december 31 2021 and 2020 the allowance for credit losses totaled 400 million and 373 million of total gross accounts receivable respectively we believe that our allowance for credit losses is adequate to cover the anticipated credit losses under current conditions however uncertainties regarding changes in the financial condition of our customers either adverse or positive could impact the amount and timing of any additional credit losses that may be required 

inventory reserves 

inventory is a significant component of current assets and is stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value this requires us to record provisions and maintain reserves for excess slow moving and obsolete inventory to determine these reserve amounts we regularly review inventory quantities on hand and compare them to estimates of future product demand market conditions production requirements and technological developments these estimates and forecasts inherently include uncertainties and require us to make judgments regarding potential future outcomes at december 31 2021 and 2020 inventory reserves totaled 374 million and 421 million of gross inventory respectively we believe that our reserves are adequate to properly value potential excess slow moving and obsolete inventory under current conditions significant or unanticipated changes to our estimates and 

baker hughes company 2021 form 10k  42 

forecasts could impact the amount and timing of any additional provisions for excess slow moving or obsolete inventory that may be required

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we are exposed to certain market risks that are inherent in our financial instruments and arise from changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates we may enter into derivative financial instrument transactions to manage or reduce market risk but do not enter into derivative financial instrument transactions for speculative purposes a discussion of our primary market risk exposure in financial instruments is presented below 

baker hughes company 2021 form 10k  43 

interest rate risk 

all of our longterm debt is comprised of fixed rate instruments we are subject to interest rate risk on our debt and investment portfolio as of december 31 2021 we had interest rate swaps with a notional amount of 500 million that converted a portion of our 1350 million aggregate principal amount of 3337 fixed rate senior notes due 2027 into a floating rate instrument with an interest rate based on a libor index as a hedge of its exposure to changes in fair value that are attributable to interest rate risk the interest rate swaps are designated and each qualify as a fair value hedging instrument the interest rate swaps are considered to be effective at achieving offsetting changes in the fair value of the hedged liability and no ineffectiveness is recognized the marktomarket of this fair value hedge was recorded as gain or loss in interest expense and was equally offset by the gain or loss of the underlying debt instrument which also was recorded in interest expense 

the following table sets forth our fixed rate longterm debt excluding finance leases and the related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates 



1 fair market value of our fixed rate longterm debt excluding finance leases was 72 billion at december 31 2021 

2 amounts represent the principal value of our longterm debt outstanding and related weighted average interest rates at the end of the respective period 

foreign currency exchange risk 

we conduct our operations around the world in a number of different currencies and we are exposed to market risks resulting from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates many of our significant foreign subsidiaries have designated the local currency as their functional currency as such future earnings are subject to change due to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates when transactions are denominated in currencies other than our functional currencies 

additionally we buy manufacture and sell components and products across global markets these activities expose us to changes in foreign currency exchange rates commodity prices and interest rates which can adversely affect revenue earned and costs of our operating businesses when the currency in which equipment is sold differs from the primary currency of the legal entity and the exchange rate fluctuates it will affect the revenue earned on the sale these sales and purchase transactions also create receivables and payables denominated in foreign currencies and exposure to foreign currency gains and losses based on changes in exchange rates changes in the price of raw materials used in manufacturing can affect the cost of manufacturing we use derivatives to mitigate or eliminate these exposures where appropriate 

we use cash flow hedging primarily to reduce or eliminate the effects of foreign currency exchange rate changes on purchase and sale contracts accordingly most derivative activity in this category consists of currency exchange contracts we had outstanding foreign currency forward contracts with notional amounts aggregating 33 billion and 68 billion to hedge exposure to currency fluctuations in various foreign currencies at december 31 2021 and 2020 respectively the notional amount of these derivative instruments do not generally represent cash amounts exchanged by us and the counterparties but rather the nominal amount upon which changes in the value of the derivatives are measured 

as of december 31 2021 the company estimates that a 1 appreciation or depreciation in the us dollar would result in an impact of less than 10 million to our pretax earnings however the company is generally able to mitigate its foreign exchange exposure where there are liquid financial markets through use of foreign currency derivative transactions also see note 16 financial instruments of the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 herein which has additional details on our strategy

contracts 

we conduct our business under various types of contracts in the upstream midstream and downstream segments including fixedfee or turnkey contracts transactional agreements for products and services and longterm aftermarket service agreements 

we enjoy stable relationships with many of our customers based on longterm project contracts and master service agreements several of those contracts require us to commit to a fixed price based on the customer’s technical specifications with little or no legal relief available due to changes in circumstances such as changes in local laws or industry or geopolitical events in some cases failure to deliver products or perform services within contractual commitments may lead to liquidated damages claims we seek to mitigate these exposures through close collaboration with our customers 

we strive to negotiate the terms of our customer contracts consistent with what we consider to be industry best practices our customers typically indemnify us for certain claims arising from the injury or death of their employees and often their contractors the loss of or damage to their facility and equipment and often that of their contractors pollution originating from their equipment or facility and all liabilities related to the well and subsurface operations including loss or damage to the well or reservoir loss of well control fire explosion or any uncontrolled flow of oil or gas conversely we typically indemnify our customers for certain claims arising from the injury or death of our employees and sometimes that of our subcontractors the loss of or damage to our equipment and pollution originating from our equipment above the surface of the earth while under our control where the above indemnities do not apply or are not consistent with industry best practices we typically provide a capped indemnity for damages caused to the customer by our negligence and include an overall limitation of liability clause it is also our general practice to include a limitation of liability for consequential loss including loss of profits and loss of revenue in all customer contracts 

our indemnity structure may not protect us in every case certain us states have enacted oil and natural gas specific antiindemnity statutes that can void the allocation of liability agreed to in a contract state law laws in countries outside the us public policy or the negotiated terms of a customer contract may also limit indemnity obligations in the event of the gross negligence or willful misconduct we sometimes contract with customers that are not the end user of our products it is our practice to seek to obtain an indemnity from our customer for any enduser claims but this is not always possible similarly government agencies and other third parties including in some cases other contractors of our customers may make claims in respect of which we are not indemnified and 

baker hughes company 2020 form 10k  5 

for which responsibility is assessed proportionate to fault we have an established process to review any risk deviations from our standard contracting practices 

the company maintains a commercial general liability insurance policy program that covers against certain operating hazards including product liability claims and personal injury claims as well as certain limited environmental pollution claims for damage to a third party or its property arising out of contact with pollution for which the company is liable however clean up and well control costs are not covered by such program all of the insurance policies purchased by the company are subject to deductible andor selfinsured retention amounts for which we are responsible for payment specific terms conditions limitations and exclusions there can be no assurance that the nature and amount of company insurance will be sufficient to fully indemnify us against liabilities related to our business 

orders and remaining performance obligations 

remaining performance obligations rpo a defined term under generally accepted accounting principles gaap are unfilled customer orders for products and product services excluding any purchase order that provides the customer with the ability to cancel or terminate without incurring a substantive penalty even if the likelihood of cancellation is remote based on historical experience for product services an amount is included for the expected life of the contract

governmental regulation 

environmental matters 

we are committed to the health and safety of people protection of the environment and compliance with environmental laws regulations and our policies our past and present operations include activities that are subject to extensive domestic including us federal state and local and international regulations with regard to air land and water quality and other environmental matters regulations continue to evolve and changes in standards of enforcement of existing regulations as well as the enactment of new legislation may require us and our customers to modify supplement or replace equipment or facilities or to change or discontinue present methods of operation our environmental compliance expenditures and our capital costs for environmental control equipment may change accordingly 

we recognize that environmental challenges including climate change warrant meaningful action in 2019 we announced our commitment to reduce our carbon equivalent emissions 50 by 2030 and achieve carbon equivalent net zero emissions by 2050 this goal encompasses emissions from our direct operations scope 1 and 2 emissions as compared to our baseline year of 2012 and was set to align with the paris accord and the specific recommendations of the united nations un intergovernmental panel on climate change’s special report on global warming of 15 o c we have proactively worked to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions over the last decade and continue efforts to reduce our overall environmental footprint by using materials wisely and preserving land water and air quality our sustainability commitments include our formal participation in the un global 

baker hughes company 2020 form 10k  9 

compact which commenced in 2019 and requires annual communication of progress the un global compact requires commitment to the un sustainable development goals and ten principles including a precautionary approach to environmental challenges initiatives to promote a greater sense of environmental responsibility and the development of environmentally friendly technologies 

while we seek to embed and verify sound environmental practices throughout our business we are and may in the future be involved in voluntary remediation projects at current and former properties typically related to historical operations on rare occasions our remediation activities are conducted as specified by a government agencyissued consent decree or agreed order remediation costs at these properties are accrued using currently available facts existing environmental permits technology and presently enacted laws and regulations for sites where we are primarily responsible for the remediation our cost estimates are developed based on internal evaluations and are not discounted we record accruals when it is probable that we will be obligated to pay amounts for environmental site evaluation remediation or related activities and such amounts can be reasonably estimated accruals are recorded even if significant uncertainties exist over the ultimate cost of the remediation ongoing environmental compliance costs such as obtaining environmental permits installation and maintenance of pollution control equipment and waste disposal are expensed as incurred 

the us comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act known as superfund imposes liability for the release of a hazardous substance into the environment superfund liability is imposed without regard to fault even if the waste disposal was in compliance with laws and regulations we have been identified as a potentially responsible party prp at various superfund sites and we accrue our share if known of the estimated remediation costs for the site prps in superfund actions have joint and several liability and may be required to pay more than their proportional share of such costs 

in some cases it is not possible to quantify our ultimate exposure because the projects are either in the investigative or early remediation stage or superfund allocation information is not yet available based upon current information we believe that our overall compliance with environmental regulations including remediation obligations environmental compliance costs and capital expenditures for environmental control equipment will not have a material adverse effect on our capital expenditures earnings or competitive position because we have either established adequate reserves or our compliance cost based on available information is not expected to be material to our consolidated financial statements our total accrual for environmental remediation was 78 million and 82 million at december 31 2020 and 2019 respectively we continue to focus on reducing future environmental liabilities by maintaining appropriate company standards and by improving our environmental assurance programs

 item 1a risk factors 

an investment in our common stock involves various risks when considering an investment in the company one should carefully consider all of the risk factors described below as well as other information included and incorporated by reference in this annual report there may be additional risks uncertainties and matters not listed below that we are unaware of or that we currently consider immaterial any of these may adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows and thus the value of an investment in the company 

operational risks 

we operate in a highly competitive environment which may adversely affect our ability to succeed 

we operate in a highly competitive environment for marketing oilfield products and services and securing equipment our ability to continually provide competitive products and services can impact our ability to defend maintain or increase prices for our products and services maintain market share and negotiate acceptable contract terms with our customers in order to be competitive we must provide new and differentiating technologies reliable products and services that perform as expected and that create value for our customers 

in addition our investments in new technologies equipment and facilities may not provide competitive returns our ability to defend maintain or increase prices for our products and services is in part dependent on the industry’s capacity relative to customer demand and on our ability to differentiate the value delivered by our products and services from our competitors’ products and services managing development of competitive technology and new product introductions on a forecasted schedule and at a forecasted cost can impact our financial results if we are unable to continue to develop and produce competitive technology or deliver it to our clients in a timely and costcompetitive manner in various markets in which we operate or if competing technology accelerates the obsolescence of any of our products or services any competitive advantage that we may hold and in turn our business financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected we are also developing artificial intelligence products and services with a third party there are no assurances that we will be able to successfully develop an artificial intelligence platform that will effectively address the artificial intelligence related needs of our customers in addition the agreement with the third party is subject to term limitations and there are no assurances that a future agreement if any will have the same terms as the current agreement

our business could be adversely affected by the widespread outbreak of a disease or virus the current global spread of the covid19 virus has and may continue to materially and adversely affect our results of operations cash flows and financial condition for an indeterminate amount of time 

the markets have experienced a decline in oil prices in response to a decline in oil demand due to the economic impacts of the covid19 pandemic as demand for our products and services declines the utilization of our assets and the prices we are able to charge our customers for our products and services could decline the continued spread of covid19 or a similar pandemic could result in further instability in the markets and decreases in commodity prices resulting in further adverse impacts on our results of operations cash flows and financial condition 

in addition the continued spread of the covid19 virus or similar pandemics and the continuation of the measures to try to contain the virus or similar viruses such as travel bans and restrictions quarantines shelter in place orders and shutdowns may further impact our workforce and operations the operations of our customers and those of our vendors and suppliers also if a significant number of our employees were to contract the virus or be quarantined the company may not be able to complete key or critical tasks not limited to but including key financial reporting and operational controls 

there is considerable uncertainty regarding such measures and potential future measures which would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations cash flows and financial condition 

our restructuring activities may not achieve the results we expect and those activities could increase which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations cash flows and financial condition 

the restructuring charges we have taken and impairment calculations we have performed are based on current market conditions including the trading price of our common shares there is no assurance that our restructuring plans will be successful and achieve the expected results in addition continued deterioration of market conditions whether due to the continued spread of covid19 or other events could result in further restructuring costs and impairments 

failure to effectively and timely execute our energy transition strategy could have an adverse effect on the demand for our technologies and services 

our future success may depend upon our ability to effectively execute on our energy transition strategy our strategy depends on our ability to develop additional technologies and work with our customers and partners to advance new energy solutions such as carbon capture use and storage hydrogen energy geothermal and other integrated solutions if the energy transition landscape changes faster than anticipated or faster than we can transition or if we fail to execute our energy transition strategy as planned demand for our technologies and services could be adversely effected 

the high cost or unavailability of raw materials equipment and supplies essential to our business could adversely affect our ability to execute our operations on a timely basis 

our manufacturing operations are dependent on having sufficient raw materials component parts and manufacturing capacity available to meet our manufacturing plans at a reasonable cost while minimizing inventories our ability to effectively manage our manufacturing operations and meet these goals can have an impact on our business including our ability to meet our manufacturing plans and revenue goals control costs and avoid shortages or oversupply of raw materials and component parts 

if we are unable to attract and retain qualified personnel we may not be able to execute our business strategy effectively and our operations could be adversely affected 

our future success depends on our ability to recruit train and retain qualified personnel people are a key resource to developing manufacturing and delivering our products and providing technical services to our customers around the world a competent welltrained highly skilled motivated and diverse workforce has a positive impact on our ability to attract and retain business periods of rapid growth present a challenge to us and our industry to recruit train and retain our employees while also managing the impact of wage inflation and the limited available qualified labor in the markets where we operate 

baker hughes company 2020 form 10k  14 

our business could be impacted by geopolitical and terrorism threats in countries where we or our customers do business and our business operations may be impacted by civil unrest andor government expropriations 

geopolitical and terrorism risks continue to grow in a number of key countries where we currently or may in the future do business geopolitical and terrorism risks could lead to among other things a loss of our investment in the country impairment of the safety of our employees and impairment of our or our customers’ ability to conduct operations 

in addition to other geopolitical and terrorism risks civil unrest continues to grow in a number of key countries where we do business our ability to conduct business operations may be impacted by that civil unrest and our assets in these countries may also be subject to expropriation by governments or other parties involved in civil unrest 

control of oil and natural gas reserves by stateowned oil companies may impact the demand for our services and products and create additional risks in our operations  

much of the world’s oil and natural gas reserves are controlled by stateowned oil companies stateowned oil companies may require their contractors to meet local content requirements or other local standards such as conducting our operations through joint ventures with local partners that could be difficult or undesirable for us to meet the failure to meet the local content requirements and other local standards may adversely impact our operations in those countries in addition our ability to work with stateowned oil companies is subject to our ability to negotiate and agree upon acceptable contract terms 

our operations involve a variety of operating hazards and risks that could cause losses 

the products that we manufacture and the services that we provide are complex and the failure of our equipment to operate properly or to meet specifications may greatly increase our customers’ costs in addition many of these products are used in inherently hazardous industries such as the offshore oilfield business these hazards include blowouts explosions nuclearrelated events fires collisions capsizings and severe weather conditions we may incur substantial liabilities or losses as a result of these hazards our insurance and contractual indemnity protection may not be sufficient or effective to protect us under all circumstances or against all risks the occurrence of a significant event against which we were not fully insured or indemnified or the failure of a customer to meet its indemnification obligations to us could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

seasonal and weather conditions could adversely affect demand for our services and operations 

variation from normal weather patterns such as cooler or warmer summers and winters can have a significant impact on demand for our services and operations adverse weather conditions such as hurricanes in the gulf of mexico may interrupt or curtail our operations or our customers’ operations cause supply disruptions and result in a loss of revenue and damage to our equipment and facilities which may or may not be insured for example extreme winter conditions in canada russia or the north sea may interrupt or curtail our operations or our customers’ operations in those areas and result in a loss of revenue 

credit and customer contracting risks 

providing services on an integrated or turnkey basis could require us to assume additional risks some of our customers require bids in the form of fixed pricing contracts 

we may enter into integrated contracts or turnkey contracts with our customers and we may choose to provide services outside our core business providing services on an integrated or turnkey basis may subject us to additional risks such as costs associated with unexpected delays or difficulties in drilling or completion operations and risks associated with subcontracting arrangements 

some of our customers require bids for contracts in the form of fixed pricing contracts that may require us to provide integrated project management services outside our normal discrete business and to act as project 

baker hughes company 2020 form 10k  15 

managers as well as service providers and may require us to assume additional risks associated with cost overruns 

we may not be able to satisfy technical requirements testing requirements or other specifications required under our service contracts and equipment purchase agreements 

our products are used in deepwater and other harsh environments and severe service applications our contracts with customers and customer requests for bids typically set forth detailed specifications or technical requirements for our products and services which may also include extensive testing requirements we anticipate that such testing requirements will become more common in our contracts in addition recent scrutiny of the offshore drilling industry has resulted in more stringent technical specifications for our products and more comprehensive testing requirements for our products to ensure compliance with such specifications we cannot provide assurance that our products will be able to satisfy the specifications or that we will be able to perform the fullscale testing necessary to prove that the product specifications are satisfied in future contract bids or under existing contracts or that the costs of modifications to our products to satisfy the specifications and testing will not adversely affect our results of operations 

we sometimes enter into consortium or similar arrangements for certain projects which could impose additional costs and obligations on us 

we sometimes enter into consortium or similar arrangements for certain projects under such arrangements each party is responsible for performing a certain scope of work within the total scope of the contracted work and the obligations expire when all contractual obligations are completed the failure or inability financially or otherwise of any of the parties to perform their obligations could impose additional costs and obligations on us these factors could result in unanticipated costs to complete the project liquidated damages or contract disputes 

our contracts may be terminated early in certain circumstances 

our contracts with clients generally may be terminated by the client for convenience default or extended force majeure which could include inability to perform due to covid19 termination for convenience will typically require the payment of an early termination fee by the client but the early termination fee may not fully compensate us for the loss of the contract termination by the client for default or extended force majeure due to events outside of our control generally will not require the client to pay an early termination fee 

our financial position results of operations or cash flows could be materially adversely affected if our clients terminate some of our contracts and we are unable to secure new contracts on a timely basis and on substantially similar terms if payments due under our contracts are suspended for an extended period of time or if a number of our contracts are renegotiated our remaining performance obligation is comprised of unfilled customer orders for products and product services expected life of contract sales for product services the actual amount and timing of revenues earned may be substantially different than the reported rpo the total dollar amount of the company’s rpo as of december 31 2020 was 234 billion 

the credit risks of having a concentrated customer base in the energy industry could result in losses 

having a concentration of customers in the energy industry may impact our overall exposure to credit risk as our customers may be similarly affected by prolonged changes in economic and industry conditions some of our customers may experience extreme financial distress as a result of falling commodity prices and may be forced to seek protection under applicable bankruptcy laws which may affect our ability to recover any amounts due from such customers furthermore countries that rely heavily upon income from hydrocarbon exports have been and may in the future be negatively and significantly affected by a drop in oil prices which could affect our ability to collect from our customers in these countries particularly national oil companies laws in some jurisdictions in which we will operate could make collection difficult or time consuming we will perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and do not expect to require collateral in support of our trade receivables while we maintain reserves for potential credit losses we cannot assure such reserves will be sufficient to meet writeoffs of uncollectible receivables or that our losses from such receivables will be consistent with our expectations 

baker hughes company 2020 form 10k  16 

additionally in the event of a bankruptcy of any of our customers we may be treated as an unsecured creditor and may collect substantially less or none of the amounts owed to us by such customer 

our customers’ activity levels and spending for our products and services and ability to pay amounts owed us could be impacted by the reduction of their cash flow and the ability of our customers to access equity or credit markets 

our customers’ access to capital is dependent on their ability to access the funds necessary to develop economically attractive projects based upon their expectations of future energy prices required investments and resulting returns limited access to external sources of funding has caused and may continue to cause customers to reduce their capital spending plans to levels supported by internally generated cash flow in addition a reduction of cash flow resulting from declines in commodity prices a reduction in borrowing bases under reservebased credit facilities or the lack of available debt or equity financing may impact the ability of our customers to pay amounts owed to us and could cause us to increase our reserve for credit losses 

legal and regulatory risks 

compliance with and changes in laws could be costly and could affect operating results in addition government disruptions could negatively impact our ability to conduct our business 

we have operations in the united states us and in more than 120 countries that can be impacted by expected and unexpected changes in the legal and business environments in which we operate in particular the shipment of goods services and technology across international borders subjects us to extensive trade laws and regulations our import activities are governed by the unique customs laws and regulations in each of the countries where we operate pursuant to their laws and regulations governments may impose economic sanctions against certain countries persons and entities that may restrict or prohibit transactions involving such countries persons and entities which may limit or prevent our conduct of business in certain jurisdictions 

compliancerelated issues could limit our ability to do business in certain countries and impact our earnings or result in investigations leading to fines penalties or other remedial measures changes that could impact the legal environment include new legislation new regulations new policies investigations and legal proceedings and new interpretations of existing legal rules and regulations in particular changes in export control laws or exchange control laws additional restrictions on doing business in countries subject to sanctions and changes in laws in countries where we operate in addition changes and uncertainty in the political environments in which our businesses operate can have a material effect on the laws rules and regulations that affect our operations government disruptions may also delay or halt the granting and renewal of permits licenses and other items required by us and our customers to conduct our business the continued success of our global business and operations depends in part on our ability to continue to anticipate and effectively manage these and other political legal and regulatory risks 

our failure to comply with the foreign corrupt practices act fcpa and other similar laws could have a negative impact on our ongoing operations 

our ability to comply with the fcpa the uk bribery act and various other antibribery and anticorruption laws depends on the success of our ongoing compliance program including our ability to successfully manage our agents distributors and other business partners and supervise train and retain competent employees we could be subject to sanctions and civil and criminal prosecution as well as fines and penalties in the event of a finding of a violation of any of these laws by us or any of our employees 

antimoney laundering and antiterrorism financing laws could have adverse consequences for us 

we maintain an enterprisewide program designed to enable us to comply with all applicable antimoney laundering and antiterrorism financing laws and regulations including the bank secrecy act and the patriot act this program includes policies procedures processes and other internal controls designed to identify monitor manage and mitigate the risk of money laundering or terrorist financing posed by our products services customers and geographic locale these controls establish procedures and processes to detect and report suspicious transactions perform customer due diligence respond to requests from law enforcement and meet all recordkeeping and reporting requirements related to particular transactions involving currency or monetary 

baker hughes company 2020 form 10k  17 

instruments we cannot be sure our programs and controls are or will remain effective to ensure our compliance with all applicable antimoney laundering and antiterrorism financing laws and regulations and our failure to comply could subject us to significant sanctions fines penalties and reputational harm all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

changes in tax laws tax rates tariffs adverse positions taken by taxing authorities and tax audits could impact operating results 

changes in tax laws tax rates tariffs changes in interpretation of tax laws the resolution of tax assessments or audits by various tax authorities and the ability to fully utilize tax loss carryforwards and tax credits could impact our operating results including additional valuation allowances for deferred tax assets 

uninsured claims and litigation against us could adversely impact our operating results 

we could be impacted by the outcome of pending litigation as well as unexpected litigation or proceedings while we have insurance coverage against operating hazards including product liability claims and personal injury claims related to our products to the extent deemed prudent by our management and to the extent insurance is available no assurance can be given that the nature and amount of that insurance will be sufficient to fully indemnify us against liabilities arising out of pending and future claims and litigation 

we may be subject to litigation if another party claims that we have infringed upon misappropriated or otherwise violated its intellectual property rights 

the tools techniques methodologies programs and components we use to provide our products and services may infringe upon misappropriate or otherwise violate the intellectual property rights of others or be challenged on that basis regardless of the merits any such claims may result in significant legal and other costs and may distract management from running our core business resolving such claims could increase our costs including through royalty payments to acquire licenses if available from third parties and through the development of replacement technologies if a license to resolve a claim were not available we might not be able to continue providing a particular service or product which could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

compliance with and rulings and litigation in connection with environmental regulations and the environmental impacts of our or our customers’ operations may adversely affect our business and operating results 

we and our business are impacted by material changes in environmental laws regulations rulings and litigation our expectations regarding our compliance with environmental laws and regulations and our expenditures to comply with environmental laws and regulations including without limitation our capital expenditures for environmental control equipment are only our forecasts regarding these matters these forecasts may be substantially different from actual results which may be affected by factors such as changes in law that impose restrictions on air or other emissions wastewater management waste disposal hydraulic fracturing or wetland and land use practices more stringent enforcement of existing environmental laws and regulations a change in our share of any remediation costs or other unexpected adverse outcomes with respect to sites where we have been named as a potentially responsible party including without limitation superfund sites the discovery of other sites or discovery of additional issues at existing sites where additional expenditures may be required to comply with environmental legal obligations and the accidental discharge of hazardous materials 

investor and public perception related to the company’s environment social and governance esg performance as well as current and future esg reporting requirements may affect our business and our operating results 

increasing focus on esg factors has led to enhanced interest in and review of performance results by investors and other stakeholders and the potential for reputational risk regulatory requirements related to esg or sustainability reporting have been issued in the european union that apply to financial market participants with implementation and enforcement starting in 2021 in the us such regulations have been issued related to pension investments in california and for the responsible investment of public funds in illinois additional regulation is pending in other states we expect regulatory requirements related to esg matters to continue to expand 

baker hughes company 2020 form 10k  18 

globally the company is committed to transparent and comprehensive reporting of our sustainability performance and considers existing standards such as the global reporting initiative’s g4 guidelines the sustainability accounting standards board’s documentation international petroleum industry environmental conservation associations ipieca sustainability reporting guidance and recommendations issued by the financial stability boards task force for climaterelated financial disclosures and science basted target initiative if we are not able to meet future sustainability reporting requirements of regulators or current and future expectations of investors customers or other stakeholders our business and ability to raise capital may be adversely affected 

international national and state governments and agencies continue to evaluate and promulgate legislation and regulations that are focused on restricting greenhouse gas ghg emissions compliance with climate action regulations applicable to our or our customers operations may have significant implications that could adversely affect our business and operating results in the fossilfuel sectors and boosting demand for technologies contributing to the climate action agenda 

in the united states the us environmental protection agency epa has taken steps to regulate ghg emissions as air pollutants under the us clean air act of 1970 as amended the epa’s greenhouse gas reporting rule requires monitoring and reporting of ghg emissions from among others certain mobile and stationary ghg emission sources in the oil and natural gas industry which in turn may include data from certain of our wellsite equipment and operations in addition the us government has proposed rules in the past setting ghg emission standards for or otherwise aimed at reducing ghg emissions from the oil and natural gas industry 

caps or fees on carbon emissions including in the us have been and may continue to be established and the cost of such caps or fees could disproportionately affect the fossilfuel sectors we are unable to predict whether and when the proposed changes in laws or regulations ultimately will occur or what they ultimately will require and accordingly we are unable to assess the potential financial or operational impact they may have on our business 

other developments focused on restricting ghg emissions include the united nations framework convention on climate change which includes implementation of the paris agreement and the kyoto protocol by the signatories the european union emission trading system article 8 of the european union energy efficiency directive and the united kingdom’s streamlined energy and carbon reporting secr the european commission’s proposed carbon border adjustment mechanism cbam and in the us the regional greenhouse gas initiative the western climate action initiative and various state programs implementing the california global warming solutions act of 2006 known as assembly bill 32 

requirements and voluntary initiatives to reduce greenhouse gas emissions as well as increased climate change awareness may result in increased costs for the oil and gas industry to curb greenhouse gas emissions and could have an adverse impact on demand for oil and natural gas 

international national and state governments agencies and bodies continue to evaluate and promulgate regulations and voluntary initiatives that are focused on restricting ghg emissions these requirements and initiatives are likely to become more stringent over time and to result in increased costs for the oil and gas industry to curb ghg emissions in addition these developments and public perception relating to climate change may curtail production and demand for hydrocarbons such as oil and natural gas by shifting demand towards and investment in relatively lower carbon energy sources such as wind solar and alternative energy solutions if renewable energy becomes more competitive than fossilfuel energy globally it could have a material effect on our results of operations 

the potential for climate related changes may pose future risks to our operations and those of our customers 

these changes can include extreme variability in weather patterns such as increased frequency and severity of significant weather events eg flooding hurricanes and tropical storms natural hazards eg increased wildfire risk rising mean temperature and sea levels and longterm changes in precipitation patterns eg drought desertification or poor water quality such changes have the potential to affect business continuity and operating results particularly at facilities in coastal areas or areas prone to chronic water scarcity 

baker hughes company 2020 form 10k  19 

changes in laws or regulations relating to data privacy and security or any actual or perceived failure by us to comply with such laws or regulations or contractual or other obligations relating to data privacy or security may adversely affect our business and operating results 

we may have access to sensitive confidential proprietary or personal data or information in certain of our businesses that is or may become subject to various data privacy and security laws regulations standards contractual obligations or customerimposed controls in the jurisdictions in which we operate the legal and regulatory environment related to data privacy and security is increasingly rigorous with new and constantly changing requirements applicable to our business and enforcement practices are likely to remain uncertain for the foreseeable future these laws and regulations may be interpreted and applied differently over time and from jurisdiction to jurisdiction and it is possible that they will be interpreted and applied in ways that may adversely affect our business and operating results 

in the us various federal and state regulators including governmental agencies like the federal trade commission have adopted or are considering adopting laws regulations and standards concerning personal information and data security internationally laws regulations and standards in many jurisdictions apply broadly to the collection use retention security disclosure transfer and other processing of personal information or other data these various and evolving federal state and international laws regulations and standards can differ significantly from one another and given our global footprint this may significantly complicate our compliance efforts and impose considerable costs such as costs related to organizational changes and implementing additional protection technologies which are likely to increase over time in addition compliance with applicable requirements may require us to modify our data processing practices and policies distract management or divert resources from other initiatives and projects all of which could adversely affect our business and operating results any failure or perceived failure by us to comply with any applicable federal state or international laws regulations standards or contractual or other obligations relating to data privacy and security could result in damage to our reputation and our relationship with our customers as well as proceedings or litigation by governmental agencies customers or individuals which could subject us to significant fines sanctions awards penalties or judgments all of which could adversely affect our business and operating results 

the effects of brexit may have a negative impact on our financial results and operations of the business 

the united kingdom uk exited brexit the european union eu on january 31 2020 as per the terms of the exit the uk has ceased to be an eu member but continued to follow its rules and contribute to its budget for an 11 month transition period ending december 31 2020 the purpose of the transition period was to give time for the uk and eu to negotiate their future relationship including a trade deal on december 24 2020 the uk and the eu reached an agreement on the terms of their future cooperation a trade deal was agreed upon and implemented as of december 31 2020 while there remains some uncertainty as to aspects of the relationship not covered by the agreement the major risk of a break in trade between the uk and the eu has now been removed the remaining uncertainty could harm our business and financial results due to fluctuations in the value of the british pound versus the us dollar euro and other currencies and could result in delayed deliveries which may impact our internal supply chain and our customer projects 

technology risks 

an inability to obtain maintain protect or enforce our intellectual property rights could adversely affect our business 

there can be no assurance that the steps we take to obtain maintain protect and enforce our intellectual property rights will be completely adequate our intellectual property rights may fail to provide us with significant competitive advantages particularly in foreign jurisdictions where we have not invested in an intellectual property portfolio or that do not have or do not enforce strong intellectual property rights the weakening of protection of our trademarks patents and other intellectual property rights could also adversely affect our business 

we are a party to a number of licenses that give us rights to intellectual property that is necessary or useful to our business our success depends in part on the ability of our licensors to obtain maintain protect and sufficiently enforce the licensed intellectual property rights we have commercialized without protection for the intellectual property rights we license other companies might be able to offer substantially identical products for sale which could adversely affect our competitive business position and harm our business products also there can be no 

baker hughes company 2020 form 10k  20 

assurances that we will be able to obtain or renew from third parties the licenses to use intellectual property rights we need in the future and there is no assurance that such licenses can be obtained on reasonable terms we would be adversely affected in the event that any such license agreement was terminated without the right for us to continue using the licensed intellectual property 

increased cybersecurity vulnerabilities and threats and more sophisticated and targeted cyber attacks and other security incidents pose risks to our systems data and business and our relationships with customers and other third parties 

in the course of conducting our business we may hold or have access to sensitive confidential proprietary or personal data or information belonging to us our employees or third parties including customers partners or suppliers increased cybersecurity vulnerabilities and threats and more sophisticated and targeted cyber attacks and other security incidents pose risks to our and our customers’ partners’ suppliers’ and thirdparty service providers’ systems data and business and the confidentiality availability and integrity of our and our employees’ and customers’ data while we attempt to mitigate these risks we remain vulnerable to cyber attacks and other security incidents given our global footprint the large number of customers partners suppliers and service providers with which we do business and the increasing sophistication and complexity of cyber attacks a cyber attack could occur and persist for an extended period without detection any investigation of a cyber attack or other security incident would be inherently unpredictable and it would take time before the completion of any investigation and before there is availability of full and reliable information during such time we would not necessarily know the extent of the harm or how best to remediate it and certain errors or actions could be repeated or compounded before they are discovered and remediated all or any of which would further increase the costs and consequences of a cyber attack or other security incident we may be required to expend significant resources to protect against respond to and recover from any cyber attacks and other security incidents as cyber attacks continue to evolve we may be required to expend significant additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our protective measures or to investigate and remediate any information security vulnerabilities in addition our remediation efforts may not be successful the inability to implement maintain and upgrade adequate safeguards could materially and adversely affect our results of operations cash flows and financial condition 

in addition to our own systems we use thirdparty service providers to process certain data or information on our behalf due to applicable laws and regulations or contractual obligations we may be held responsible for cybersecurity incidents attributed to our service providers to the extent affecting information we share with them although we contractually require these service providers to implement and maintain reasonable security measures we cannot control third parties and cannot guarantee that a security breach will not occur in their systems 

despite our and our service providers’ efforts to protect our data and information we and our service providers have been and may in the future be vulnerable to security breaches theft misplaced or lost data programming errors phishing attacks denial of service attacks acts of vandalism computer viruses malware ransomware employee errors andor malfeasance or similar events including those perpetrated by criminals or nationstate actors that could potentially lead to the compromise unauthorized access use disclosure modification or destruction of data or information improper use of our systems defective products production downtimes and operational disruptions in addition a cyber attack or any other significant compromise or breach of our data security media reports about such an incident whether accurate or not or under certain circumstances our failure to make adequate or timely disclosures to the public law enforcement agencies or affected individuals following any such event whether due to delayed discovery or a failure to follow existing protocols could adversely impact our operating results and result in other negative consequences including damage to our reputation or competitiveness harm to our relationships with customers partners suppliers and other third parties distraction to our management remediation or increased protection costs significant litigation or regulatory action fines and penalties given the increased prevalence of customerimposed cybersecurity controls and other related contractual obligations towards customers or other third parties a cyber attack or other security incident also could result in breach of contract or indemnity claims against us by customers or other counterparties 

while we currently maintain cybersecurity insurance such insurance may not be sufficient in type or amount to cover us against claims related to cybersecurity breaches or attacks failures or other data securityrelated incidents and we cannot be certain that cyber insurance will continue to be available to us on economically reasonable terms or at all or that an insurer will not deny coverage as to any future claim the successful assertion of one or more large claims against us that exceed available insurance coverage or the occurrence of 

baker hughes company 2020 form 10k  21 

changes in our insurance policies including premium increases or the imposition of large deductible or coinsurance requirements could materially and adversely affect our results of operations cash flows and financial condition 

industry and market risks 

volatility of oil and natural gas prices can adversely affect demand for our products and services 

prices of oil and gas products are set on a commodity basis as a result the volatility in oil and natural gas prices can impact our customers’ activity levels and spending for our products and services current energy prices are important contributors to cash flow for our customers and their ability to fund exploration and development activities expectations about future prices and price volatility are important for determining future spending levels 

demand for oil and natural gas is subject to factors beyond our control which may adversely affect our operating results changes in the global economy could impact our customers’ spending levels and our revenue and operating results 

demand for oil and natural gas as well as the demand for our services and products is highly correlated with global economic growth a prolonged reduction in oil and natural gas prices may require us to record additional asset impairments such a potential impairment charge could have a material adverse impact on our operating results 

supply of oil and natural gas is subject to factors beyond our control which may adversely affect our operating results 

productive capacity for oil and natural gas is dependent on our customers’ decisions to develop and produce oil and natural gas reserves and on the regulatory environment in which our customers and we operate the ability to produce oil and natural gas can be affected by the number and productivity of new wells drilled and completed as well as the rate of production and resulting depletion of existing wells 

currency fluctuations or devaluations may impact our operating results 

fluctuations or devaluations in foreign currencies relative to the us dollar can impact our revenue and our costs of doing business as well as the costs of doing business of our customers 

changes in economic andor market conditions may impact our ability to borrow andor cost of borrowing 

the condition of the capital markets and equity markets in general can affect the price of our common stock and our ability to obtain financing if necessary if our credit rating is downgraded it could increase borrowing costs under credit facilities and commercial paper programs as well as increase the cost of renewing or obtaining or make it more difficult to renew obtain or issue new debt financing 

risks related to the separation from ge 

we may experience challenges relating to the separation from ge and the anticipated benefits from the master agreement framework and the omnibus agreement 

if we experience difficulties with the separation from ge the anticipated benefits of the master agreement framework and the omnibus agreement may not be realized fully or at all may take longer to realize than expected or may be offset by the decrease in business from certain customers or other negative impacts the impact of the separation from ge could have an adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition or other prospects on an ongoing basis 

we have incurred and expect to continue to incur additional costs in connection with the separation from ge the master agreement framework and the omnibus agreement

executive summary 

we are an energy technology company with a broad and diversified portfolio of technologies and services that span the energy and industrial value chain we operate through our four business segments oilfield services ofs oilfield equipment ofe turbomachinery  process solutions tps and digital solutions ds 

we sell products and services primarily in the global oil and gas markets within the upstream midstream and downstream segments throughout 2020 the industry experienced multiple factors which drove expectations for global oil and gas related spending to be lower than 2019 first the covid19 pandemic lowered global demand for hydrocarbons as social distancing and travel restrictions were implemented across the world second the lifting of organization of the petroleum exporting countries opec supply curtailments in the first quarter of 2020 and the associated increase in production drove the global excess supply of hydrocarbons higher in the second quarter of 2020 opec reached a supply curtailment agreement of up to 10 million barrels per day which drove expectations for future hydrocarbon supply lower after significant turmoil during the first half of the year from the industry downturn oil markets stabilized and demand for oil improved in the second half of the year lastly global gross domestic product gdp declined in 2020 as a result of the impact from the covid19 pandemic 

since the covid19 pandemic began the health and safety of our employees has continued to be a top priority we have taken critical steps as a company to reduce the risk of exposure as well as mitigate the impacts of this pandemic to our employees contractors and partners we have adopted remote working where possible where onsite operations are required masks are mandatory and our employees have adopted social distancing we have worked with our employees to implement other sitespecific precautionary measures to reduce the risk of exposure we are collaborating closely with our customers suppliers and vendors to minimize operational disruption in addition we have restricted nonessential business travel and have encouraged our employees customers and partners to collaborate virtually 

our goal throughout the downturn in 2020 was to remain disciplined in allocating capital focus on liquidity and cash preservation and to preserve our investment grade rating while also maintaining our current dividend payout 

during the year we took necessary actions to rightsize the business for expected activity levels in the first quarter of 2020 we approved a plan for restructuring and other actions totaling 18 billion which was increased by 03 billion as we took further actions during the year to address the continuing industry challenges total restructuring and other costs were 21 billion in 2020 these charges are primarily related to the costs for reductions in work force product line exits in certain geographies and the write down of inventory and intangible assets these actions took place across the business and our corporate functions we expect the cash payback of these actions to be less than one year 

in addition during the first quarter of 2020 our market capitalization declined significantly driven by the macroeconomic and geopolitical conditions caused by the covid19 pandemic and collapse of oil prices based on these events we concluded that a triggering event occurred and we performed an interim quantitative impairment test as of march 31 2020 based upon the results of the impairment test we recognized a goodwill impairment charge of 148 billion during the first quarter of 2020 there were no other goodwill impairments in 2020 

baker hughes company 2020 form 10k  28 

in 2020 we generated revenue of 207 billion compared to 238 billion in 2019 the decrease in revenue was driven by declines in all four of our segments primarily due to the industry downturn loss before income taxes was 152 billion in 2020 and included goodwill impairment charges of 148 billion restructuring and impairment charges of 19 billion inventory impairment charges of 246 million separation and merger related costs of 134 million and a gain of 14 billion related to our investment in c3ai recorded in other nonoperating income in 2019 income before income taxes was 08 billion which also included restructuring and impairment charges of 342 million and separation and merger related costs of 184 million 

the gain of 14 billion related to our c3ai investment was recorded in the fourth quarter of 2020 we invested in c3ai when we formed our partnership in june 2019 in december 2020 c3ai completed its initial public offering which requires us to mark our investment to fair value both our investment and strong partnership with c3ai demonstrate our commitment for growth in high potential segments as we develop and market new ai solutions for the oil and gas industry 

outlook 

our business is exposed to a number of macro factors which influence our outlook and expectations given the current volatile conditions in the industry after significant volatility during the first half of 2020 oil markets stabilized during the second half of the year however there is still uncertainty in the global economic outlook and impact on oil and gas markets in the wake of the covid19 pandemic 

• north america onshore activity in 2020 we experienced a significant decline in rig count as compared to 2019 driven by lower commodity prices we expect north american onshore activity to improve in 2021 as compared to the second half of 2020 

• international onshore activity in 2020 we experienced a decline in rig count as compared to 2019 driven by lower commodity prices we expect onshore spending outside of north america to stabilize in early 2021 and see a modest recovery over the second half of the year 

• offshore projects in 2020 we experienced significantly fewer offshore projects reaching positive final investment decisions due to the economic uncertainty and lower oil and gas prices in 2021 we expect the offshore markets to stabilize and for the number of tree awards in the market to remain stable or grow modestly compared to 2020 levels 

• liquefied natural gas lng projects we remain optimistic on the lng market long term and view natural gas as a transition and destination fuel we continue to view the longterm economics of the lng industry as positive 

we have other segments in our portfolio that are more correlated with various industrial metrics including gdp such as our digital solutions segment 

we also have segments within our portfolio that are exposed to new energy solutions specifically focused around decarbonization of energy and industry including hydrogen geothermal carbon capture utilization and storage and energy storage we expect to see continued growth in these segments as new energy solutions become a more prevalent part of the broader energy mix 

overall we believe our portfolio is well positioned to compete across the energy value chain and deliver comprehensive solutions for our customers we remain optimistic about the longterm economics of the industry but we are continuing to operate with flexibility given our expectations for volatility and changing activity levels in the near term while governments may change or discontinue incentives for renewable energy additions we do not anticipate any significant impacts to our business in the foreseeable future 

over time we believe the world’s demand for energy will continue to rise and that hydrocarbons will play a major role in meeting the worlds energy needs for the foreseeable future as such we remain focused on delivering innovative costefficient solutions that deliver step changes in operating and economic performance for our customers

business environment 

the following discussion and analysis summarizes the significant factors affecting our results of operations financial condition and liquidity position as of and for the year ended december 31 2020 and 2019 and should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes of the company 

we operate in more than 120 countries helping customers find evaluate drill produce transport and process hydrocarbon resources our revenue is predominately generated from the sale of products and services to major national and independent oil and natural gas companies worldwide and is dependent on spending by our customers for oil and natural gas exploration field development and production this spending is driven by a number of factors including our customers forecasts of future energy demand and supply their access to resources to develop and produce oil and natural gas their ability to fund their capital programs the impact of new government regulations and most importantly their expectations for oil and natural gas prices as a key driver of their cash flows 

oil and natural gas prices 

oil and natural gas prices are summarized in the table below as averages of the daily closing prices during each of the periods indicated 



1 energy information administration eia europe brent spot price per barrel 

2 eia cushing ok wti west texas intermediate spot price 

3 eia henry hub natural gas spot price per million british thermal unit 

outside north america customer spending is most heavily influenced by brent oil prices after a stable and positive 2019 volatility increased sharply in april 2020 when oil prices dropped nearly 87 due to lower demand brent oil prices decreased from a high of 7025bbl in january 2020 to a low of 912bbl in april 2020 the average brent oil prices decreased to 4196bbl in 2020 from 6428bbl in 2019 due to lower prices during majority of the year 2020 

in north america customer spending is highly driven by wti oil prices which similarly to brent oil prices on average decreased to 3916bbl in 2020 from 5698bbl in 2019 and ranged from a high of 6327bbl in january 2020 to a low of 3698bbl in april 2020 

in north america natural gas prices as measured by the henry hub natural gas spot price averaged 203mmbtu in 2020 representing a 21 decrease over the prior year throughout the year henry hub natural gas spot prices ranged from a low of 133mmbtu in september 2020 to a high of 314mmbtu in october 2020 according to the us department of energy doe working natural gas in storage at the end of 2020 was 3460 billion cubic feet bcf which was 77 or 268 bcf above the corresponding week in 2019

baker hughes rig count 

the baker hughes rig counts are an important business barometer for the drilling industry and its suppliers when drilling rigs are active they consume products and services produced by the oil service industry rig count trends are driven by the exploration and development spending by oil and natural gas companies which in turn is influenced by current and future price expectations for oil and natural gas the counts may reflect the relative strength and stability of energy prices and overall market activity however these counts should not be solely relied on as other specific and pervasive conditions may exist that affect overall energy prices and market activity 

we have been providing rig counts to the public since 1944 we gather all relevant data through our field service personnel who obtain the necessary data from routine visits to the various rigs customers contractors and other outside sources as necessary we base the classification of a well as either oil or natural gas primarily upon filings made by operators in the relevant jurisdiction this data is then compiled and distributed to various wire services and trade associations and is published on our website we believe the counting process and resulting data is reliable however it is subject to our ability to obtain accurate and timely information rig counts are compiled weekly for the us and canada and monthly for all international rigs published international rig counts do not include rigs drilling in certain locations such as russia the caspian region and onshore china because this information is not readily available 

beginning in the second quarter of 2019 ukraine was added to the baker hughes international rig count the company will continue tracking active drilling rigs in the country going forward historical periods will not be updated 

rigs in the us and canada are counted as active if on the day the count is taken the well being drilled has been started but drilling has not been completed and the well is anticipated to be of sufficient depth to be a potential consumer of our drill bits in international areas rigs are counted on a weekly basis and deemed active if drilling activities occurred during the majority of the week the weekly results are then averaged for the month and published accordingly the rig count does not include rigs that are in transit from one location to another rigging up being used in nondrilling activities including production testing completion and workover and are not expected to be significant consumers of drill bits 

the rig counts are summarized in the table below as averages for each of the periods indicated 



2020 compared to 2019 

overall the rig count was 1349 in 2020 a decrease of 38 as compared to 2019 due primarily to north american activity the rig count in north america decreased 52 and the international rig count decreased 25 in 2020 compared to 2019 both as a result of lower commodity prices and exploration and production capital expenditure reductions 

within north america the decrease was primarily driven by the us rig count which was down 54 on average when compared to the same period last year and a decrease in the canadian rig count which was down 33 on average internationally the decrease in the rig count was driven primarily by decreases in the latin america region africa region and europe region of 44 34 and 24 respectively

results of operations 

the discussions below relating to significant line items from our consolidated statements of income loss are based on available information and represent our analysis of significant changes or events that impact the comparability of reported amounts where appropriate we have identified specific events and changes that affect comparability or trends and where reasonably practicable have quantified the impact of such items in addition the discussions below for revenue and cost of revenue are on a total basis as the business drivers for product sales and services are similar all dollar amounts in tabulations in this section are in millions of dollars unless otherwise stated certain columns and rows may not add due to the use of rounded numbers 

our results of operations are evaluated by the chief executive officer on a consolidated basis as well as at the segment level the performance of our operating segments is evaluated based on segment operating income loss which is defined as income loss before income taxes and equity in loss of affiliate and before the following net interest expense net other nonoperating income loss corporate expenses restructuring impairment and other charges goodwill and inventory impairments separationrelated costs and certain gains and losses not allocated to the operating segments 

in evaluating the segment performance the company uses the following 

volume volume is the increase or decrease in products andor services sold periodoverperiod excluding the impact of foreign exchange and price the volume impact on profit is calculated by multiplying the prior period profit rate by the change in revenue volume between the current and prior period it also includes price defined as the change in sales price for a comparable product or service periodoverperiod and is calculated as the periodoverperiod change in sales prices of comparable products and services 

foreign exchange fx fx measures the translational foreign exchange impact or the translation impact of the periodoverperiod change on sales and costs directly attributable to change in the foreign exchange rate compared to the us dollar fx impact is calculated by multiplying the functional currency amounts revenue or profit with the periodoverperiod fx rate variance using the average exchange rate for the respective period 

inflationdeflation inflationdeflation is defined as the increase or decrease in direct and indirect costs of the same type for an equal amount of volume it is calculated as the yearoveryear change in cost ie price paid of direct material compensation  benefits and overhead costs 

productivity productivity is measured by the remaining variance in profit after adjusting for the periodoverperiod impact of volume  price foreign exchange and inflationdeflation as defined above improved or lower periodoverperiod cost productivity is the result of cost efficiencies or inefficiencies such as cost decreasing or increasing more than volume or cost increasing or decreasing less than volume or changes in sales mix among segments this also includes the periodoverperiod variance of transactional foreign exchange aside from those foreign currency devaluations that are reported separately for business evaluation purposes 

orders and remaining performance obligations 

our statement of income loss displays sales and costs of sales in accordance with sec regulations under which “goods” is required to include all sales of tangible products and “services” must include all other sales including other services activities for the amounts shown below we distinguish between “equipment” and “product services” where product services refers to sales under product services agreements including sales of both goods such as spare parts and equipment upgrades and related services such as monitoring maintenance and repairs which is an important part of our operations we refer to “product services” simply as “services” within management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

orders  we recognized orders of 207 billion and 270 billion in 2020 and 2019 respectively in 2020 equipment orders were down 27 and service orders were down 20 compared to 2019 

remaining performance obligations rpo as of december 31 2020 and 2019 the aggregate amount of the transaction price allocated to the unsatisfied or partially unsatisfied performance obligations was 234 billion and 229 billion respectively

income taxes 

in 2020 our income tax expense was 559 million an increase of 77 million from 482 million in 2019 the increase was primarily due to valuation allowances on deferred tax assets and the geographical mix of earnings partially offset by the benefit of the us coronavirus aid relief and economic security act cares act

liquidity and capital resources 

our objective in financing our business is to maintain sufficient liquidity adequate financial resources and financial flexibility in order to fund the requirements of our business despite the challenging dynamics during 2020 we continue to maintain solid financial strength and liquidity at december 31 2020 we had cash and cash equivalents of 41 billion compared to 32 billion at december 31 2019 our liquidity is further supported by a revolving credit facility of 3 billion and access to both commercial paper and uncommitted lines of credit at december 31 2020 we had no borrowings outstanding under the revolving credit facility or our uncommitted lines of credit and had £600 million 801 million commercial paper outstanding our next debt maturity is december 2022 

cash and cash equivalents includes 44 million and 162 million of cash held on behalf of ge at december 31 2020 and 2019 respectively excluding cash held on behalf of ge our us subsidiaries held approximately 1 billion and 04 billion while our foreign subsidiaries held approximately 31 billion and 27 billion of our cash and cash equivalents as at december 31 2020 and 2019 respectively a substantial portion of the cash held by foreign subsidiaries at december 31 2020 has been reinvested in active nonus business operations if we decide at a later date to repatriate those funds to the us they will generally be free of us federal tax but may incur other taxes such as withholding or state taxes 

we have a 3 billion committed unsecured revolving credit facility the 2019 credit agreement with commercial banks maturing in december 2024 the 2019 credit agreement contains certain customary representations and 

baker hughes company 2020 form 10k  36 

warranties certain customary affirmative covenants and certain customary negative covenants upon the occurrence of certain events of default our obligations under the 2019 credit agreement may be accelerated such events of default include payment defaults to lenders under the 2019 credit agreement and other customary defaults no such events of default have occurred we have no borrowings under the 2019 credit agreement 

in addition we have a commercial paper program under which we may issue from time to time commercial paper with maturities of no more than 397 days during the second quarter of 2020 we established a £600 million commercial paper facility under which the bank of england may invest through the covid corporate financing facility the program which increased our total commercial paper program from 30 billion to approximately 38 billion in may 2020 we issued £600 million of commercial paper under the program that matures in april 2021 and can be repaid prior to that with no additional cost 

certain senior notes contain covenants that restrict our ability to take certain actions see note 10 borrowings of the notes to consolidated financial statements in this annual report for further details at december 31 2020 we were in compliance with all debt covenants 

we continuously review our liquidity and capital resources if market conditions were to change for instance due to the uncertainty created by the covid19 pandemic or a significant decline in oil and gas prices and our revenue was reduced significantly or operating costs were to increase significantly our cash flows and liquidity could be negatively impacted additionally it could cause the rating agencies to lower our credit ratings there are no ratings triggers that would accelerate the maturity of any borrowings under our committed credit facility however a downgrade in our credit ratings could increase the cost of borrowings under the credit facility and could also limit or preclude our ability to issue commercial paper should this occur we could seek alternative sources of funding including borrowing under the credit facility 

during the year ended december 31 2020 we dispersed cash to fund a variety of activities including certain working capital needs restructuring and ge separation related costs capital expenditures the payment of dividends and distributions to noncontrolling interests we believe that cash on hand cash flows generated from operating and financing activities and the available credit facility will provide sufficient liquidity to manage our global cash needs 

cash flows 

cash flows provided by used in each type of activity were as follows for the years ended december 31 



fiscal year 2020 to fiscal year 2019 

operating activities 

our largest source of operating cash is payments from customers of which the largest component is collecting cash related to our sales of products and services including advance payments or progress collections for work to be performed the primary use of operating cash is to pay our suppliers employees tax authorities and others for a wide range of goods and services 

cash flows from operating activities generated cash of 1304 million and 2126 million for the years ended december 31 2020 and 2019 respectively for the year ended december 31 2020 cash generated from operating activities were primarily driven by net losses adjusted for certain noncash items primarily depreciation amortization impairments loss on sale of businesses and the unrealized gain on an equity security and working capital which includes contract and other deferred assets 

working capital generated 216 million of cash in 2020 primarily due to receivables and positive progress collections partially offset by accounts payable as we continue to improve our working capital processes in 2019 

baker hughes company 2020 form 10k  37 

working capital generated 553 million of cash primarily due to net positive progress collections and receivables in tps for equipment contracts included in our cash flows from operating activities for 2020 and 2019 are payments of 670 million and 307 million respectively made primarily for employee severance as a result of our restructuring activities and separationrelated costs including the buildout of information technology infrastructure as a result of ge separation activities 

investing activities 

cash flows from investing activities used cash of 618 million and 1045 million for the years ended december 31 2020 and 2019 respectively 

our principal recurring investing activity is the funding of capital expenditures to ensure that we have the appropriate levels and types of machinery and equipment in place to generate revenue from operations expenditures for capital assets totaled 974 million and 1240 million for 2020 and 2019 respectively partially offset by cash flows from the sale of property plant and equipment of 187 million and 264 million in 2020 and 2019 respectively proceeds from the disposal of assets related primarily to equipment that was lostinhole and to property machinery and equipment no longer used in operations that was sold throughout the period in 2020 we received proceeds of 187 million primarily from the sale of our rod lift systems and our surface pressure control flow businesses in 2019 we received 77 million from the sale of our highspeed reciprocating compression business 

financing activities 

cash flows from financing activities generated cash of 225 million and used cash of 1534 million for the years ended december 31 2020 and 2019 respectively 

we had net repayments of shortterm debt of 204 million and 542 million in 2020 and 2019 respectively we had repayments of our longterm debt of 42 million in 2020 and 570 million in 2019 which was primarily driven by our repayment of certain senior notes 

in 2020 we had proceeds from the issuance of commercial paper of £600 million 737 million at date of issuance in addition we had proceeds from the issuance of 500 million aggregate principal amount of 4486 senior notes due may 2030 we pay interest on the notes each may and november in 2019 we had proceeds from the issuance of 525 million aggregate principal amount of 3138 senior notes due november 2029 we pay interest on the notes each may and november we used the proceeds from this offering to repurchase all of our outstanding 32 senior notes due august 2021 

during 2020 we paid aggregate dividends of 488 million to our class a stockholders and bhh llc made a distribution of 256 million to ge during 2019 we paid aggregate dividends of 395 million to our class a stockholders and bhh llc made a distribution of 350 million to ge additionally in september 2019 bhh llc repurchased 119 million of its units from ge for a cash consideration of 250 million 

cash requirements 

in 2021 we believe cash on hand cash flows from operating activities the available revolving credit facility and availability under our existing shelf registrations of debt will provide us with sufficient capital resources and liquidity to manage our working capital needs meet contractual obligations fund capital expenditures and dividends and support the development of our shortterm and longterm operating strategies when necessary we issue commercial paper or other shortterm debt to fund cash needs in the us in excess of the cash generated in the us 

our capital expenditures can be adjusted and managed by us to match market demand and activity levels based on current market conditions capital expenditures net of proceeds from disposal of assets in 2021 are expected to be below 2020 levels the expenditures are expected to be used primarily for normal recurring items necessary to support our business we also anticipate making income tax payments in the range of 350 million to 450 million in 2021 

baker hughes company 2020 form 10k  38 

contractual obligations 

in the table below we set forth our contractual obligations as of december 31 2020 certain amounts included in this table are based on our estimates and assumptions about these obligations including their duration anticipated actions by third parties and other factors the contractual obligations we will actually pay in future periods may vary from those reflected in the table because the estimates and assumptions are subjective 



1 amounts represent the expected cash payments for the principal amounts related to our debt including finance lease obligations amounts for debt do not include any deferred issuance costs or unamortized discounts or premiums including step up in the value of the debt on the acquisition of bhi expected cash payments for interest are excluded from these amounts total debt and finance lease obligations includes 45 million payable to ge and its affiliates as there is no fixed payment schedule on the amount payable to ge and its affiliates we have classified it as payable in less than one year 

2 amounts represent the expected cash payments for interest on our longterm debt and finance lease obligations 

3 amounts represent the future minimum payments under operating leases with initial terms of one year or more our lease terms may include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise that option 

4 purchase obligations include expenditures for capital assets for 2020 as well as agreements to purchase goods or services or licenses that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased fixed minimum or variable price provisions and the approximate timing of the transaction 

due to the uncertainty with respect to the timing of potential future cash outflows associated with our uncertain tax positions we are unable to make reasonable estimates of the period of cash settlement if any to the respective taxing authorities therefore 601 million in uncertain tax positions including interest and penalties have been excluded from the contractual obligations table above see note 12 income taxes of the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 herein for further information 

we have certain defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans covering certain of our us and international employees in 2020 we made contributions and paid direct benefits of approximately 39 million in connection with those plans and we anticipate funding between approximately 30 million to 45 million in 2021 amounts for pension funding obligations are based on assumptions that are subject to change therefore we are currently not able to reasonably estimate our contribution figures after 2021 see note 11 employee benefit plans of the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 herein for further information 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

in the normal course of business with customers vendors and others we have entered into offbalance sheet arrangements such as surety bonds for performance letters of credit and other bank issued guarantees which totaled approximately 41 billion at december 31 2020 it is not practicable to estimate the fair value of these financial instruments none of the offbalance sheet arrangements either has or is likely to have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 

as of december 31 2020 we had no material offbalance sheet financing arrangements other than those discussed above as such we are not materially exposed to any financing liquidity market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in such financing arrangements 

baker hughes company 2020 form 10k  39 

other factors affecting liquidity 

registration statements  in november 2018 baker hughes filed a universal shelf registration statement on form s3asr automatic shelf registration with the sec to have the ability to sell various types of securities including debt securities class a common stock preferred stock guarantees of debt securities purchase contracts and units the specific terms of any securities to be sold would be described in supplemental filings with the sec the registration statement will expire in 2021 

in december 2020 bhh llc baker hughes netherlands funding company bv and baker hughes coobligor inc filed a shelf registration statement on form s3 with the sec to have the ability to sell up to 3 billion in debt securities in amounts to be determined at the time of an offering any such offering if it does occur may happen in one or more transactions the specific terms of any debt securities to be sold would be described in supplemental filings with the sec the registration statement will expire in december 2023 

customer receivables  in line with industry practice we may bill our customers for services provided in arrears dependent upon contractual terms in a challenging economic environment we may experience delays in the payment of our invoices due to customers lower cash flow from operations or their more limited access to credit markets while historically there have not been material nonpayment events we attempt to mitigate this risk through working with our customers to restructure their debts a customers failure or delay in payment could have a material adverse effect on our shortterm liquidity and results from operations as of december 31 2020 16 of our gross trade receivables were from customers in the us other than the us no other country or single customer accounted for more than 10 of our gross trade receivables at this date as of december 31 2019 19 of our gross trade receivables were from customers in the us 

international operations  our cash that is held outside the us is 76 of the total cash balance as of december 31 2020 we may not be able to use this cash quickly and efficiently due to exchange or cash controls that could make it challenging as a result our cash balance may not represent our ability to quickly and efficiently use this cash 

supply chain finance programs  under supply chain finance programs administered by a third party our suppliers are given the opportunity to sell receivables from us to participating financial institutions at their sole discretion at a rate that leverages our credit rating and thus might be more beneficial to our suppliers our responsibility is limited to making payment on the terms originally negotiated with our supplier regardless of whether the supplier sells its receivable to a financial institution the range of payment terms we negotiate with our suppliers is consistent irrespective of whether a supplier participates in the program these liabilities continue to be presented as accounts payable in our condensed consolidated statements of financial position and reflected as cash flow from operating activities when settled we do not believe that changes in the availability of supply chain financing programs would have a material impact on our liquidity 

critical accounting estimates 

accounting estimates and assumptions discussed in this section are those considered to be the most critical to an understanding of our financial statements because they involve significant judgments and uncertainties many of these estimates include determining fair value these estimates reflect our best judgment about current and for some estimates future economic and market conditions and their potential effects based on information available as of the date of these financial statements if these conditions change from those expected it is reasonably possible that the judgments and estimates described below could change which may result in future impairments of goodwill intangibles and longlived assets increases in reserves for contingencies establishment of valuation allowances on deferred tax assets and increased tax liabilities among other effects also see note 1 summary of significant accounting policies of the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 herein which discusses our most significant accounting policies 

we have defined a critical accounting estimate as one that is both important to the portrayal of either our financial condition or results of operations and requires us to make difficult subjective or complex judgments or estimates about matters that are uncertain the audit committee of our board of directors has reviewed our critical accounting estimates and the disclosure presented below during the past three fiscal years we have not made any material changes in the methodology used to establish the critical accounting estimates and we believe that the 

baker hughes company 2020 form 10k  40 

following are the critical accounting estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements there are other items within our consolidated financial statements that require estimation and judgment but they are not deemed critical as defined above 

revenue recognition on longterm product services agreements 

we have longterm service agreements with our customers predominately within our tps segment these agreements typically require us to maintain assets sold to the customer over a defined contract term these agreements have average contract terms of greater than 10 years from time to time these contract terms may be extended through contract modifications or amendments which may result in revisions to future billing and cost estimates revenue recognition on longterm product services agreements requires estimates of both customer payments and the costs to perform required maintenance services over the contract term we recognize revenue on an overtime basis using input method to measure our progress toward completion at the estimated margin rate of the contract 

to develop our billings estimates we consider the number of billable events that will occur based on estimated utilization of the asset under contract over the life of the contract term this estimated utilization will consider both historical and market conditions asset retirements and new product introductions if applicable 

to develop our cost estimates we consider the timing and extent of maintenance and overhaul events including the amount and cost of labor spare parts and other resources required to perform the services in developing our cost estimates we utilize a combination of our historical cost experience and expected cost improvements cost improvements are only included in future cost estimates after savings have been observed in actual results or proven effective through an extensive regulatory or engineering approval process 

we routinely review the estimates used in our product services agreements and regularly revise them to adjust for changes these revisions are based on objectively verifiable information that is available at the time of the review 

the difference between the timing of our revenue recognition and cash received from our customers results in either a contract asset revenue in excess of billings or a contract liability billings in excess of revenue see note 7 contract and other deferred assets and note 8 progress collections and deferred income of the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 herein for further information 

we regularly assess customer credit risk inherent in the carrying amounts of receivables and contract assets and estimated earnings including the risk that contractual penalties may not be sufficient to offset our accumulated investment in the event of customer termination we gain insight into expected future utilization and cost trends as well as credit risk through our knowledge of the equipment installed and the close interaction with our customers through supplying critical services and parts over extended periods revisions to cost or billing estimates may affect a product services agreement’s total estimated profitability resulting in an adjustment of earnings such adjustments generated earnings of 17 million 1 million and 26 million for the three years ended december 31 2020 2019 and 2018 respectively we provide for probable losses when they become evident 

on december 31 2020 our longterm product service agreements net of related billings in excess of revenues of 03 billion represent approximately 29 of our total estimated life of contract billings of 112 billion cash billings collected on these contracts were approximately 06 billion during the years ended december 31 2020 and 2019 our contracts on average are approximately 18 complete based on costs incurred to date and our estimate of future costs revisions to our estimates of future revenue or costs that increase or decrease total estimated contract profitability by 1 would increase or decrease the longterm product service agreements balance by 004 billion 

goodwill and other identified intangible assets 

we perform an annual impairment test of goodwill on a qualitative or quantitative basis for each of our reporting units as of july 1 or more frequently when circumstances indicate an impairment may exist at the reporting unit level the process of evaluating the potential impairment of goodwill is highly subjective and requires significant judgment when performing the annual impairment test we have the option of first performing a qualitative 

baker hughes company 2020 form 10k  41 

assessment to determine the existence of events and circumstances that would lead to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount if such a conclusion is reached we would then be required to perform a quantitative impairment assessment of goodwill however if the assessment leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is greater than its carrying amount then no further assessments are required a quantitative assessment for the determination of impairment is made by comparing the carrying amount of each reporting unit with its fair value which is generally calculated using a combination of market comparable transaction and discounted cash flow approaches we assess the valuation methodology based upon the relevance and availability of the data at the time the valuation is performed 

pension assumptions 

pension benefits are calculated using significant inputs to the actuarial models that measure pension benefit obligations and related effects on operations two assumptions discount rate and expected return on assets are important elements of plan expense and assetliability measurement we evaluate these critical assumptions at least annually on a plan and country specific basis we periodically evaluate other assumptions involving demographic factors such as retirement age mortality and turnover and update them to reflect its experience and expectations for the future actual results in any given year will often differ from actuarial assumptions because of economic and other factors 

projected benefit obligations are measured as the present value of expected payments discounted using the weighted average of market observed yields for high quality fixed income securities with maturities that correspond to the payment of benefits lower discount rates increase present values and subsequent year pension expense and higher discount rates decrease present values and subsequent year pension expense the discount rates used to determine the benefit obligations for our principal pension plans at december 31 2020 and 2019 were 166 and 234 respectively reflecting market interest rates our expected return on assets at december 31 2020 and 2019 was 420 and 548 respectively 

income taxes 

we operate in more than 120 countries and our effective tax rate is based on our income statutory tax rates and differences between tax laws and the us gaap in these various jurisdictions tax laws are complex and subject to different interpretations by the taxpayer and respective governmental taxing authorities this rate is further impacted by the extent earnings are indefinitely reinvested as repatriation of these foreign earnings would incur other additional taxes such as withholding and income taxes indefinite reinvestment is determined by management’s judgment and intentions concerning the future operations of the company in cases where repatriation would otherwise incur significant withholding or income taxes these foreign earnings have been indefinitely reinvested in active nonus business operations computation of the potential deferred tax liability associated with these undistributed earnings and any other basis differences is not practicable 

deferred income tax assets represent amounts available to reduce income taxes payable in future years we evaluate the recoverability of these future tax deductions and credits by assessing the adequacy of future taxable income from all sources including reversal of taxable temporary differences forecasted operating earnings and available tax planning strategies these sources of income rely heavily on estimates we use our historical experience and short and long range business forecasts to provide insight we record a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 

our tax filings routinely are subject to audit by the tax authorities in the jurisdictions where we conduct business these audits may result in assessments of additional taxes that are resolved with the tax authorities or through the courts we have provided for the amounts we believe will ultimately result from these proceedings but settlements of issues raised in these audits may affect our tax rate we have 483 million of gross unrecognized tax benefits excluding interest and penalties at december 31 2020 we are not able to reasonably estimate in which future periods these amounts ultimately will be settled 

baker hughes company 2020 form 10k  42 

other loss contingencies 

other loss contingencies are uncertain and unresolved matters that arise in the ordinary course of business and result from events or actions by others that have the potential to result in a future loss such contingencies include but are not limited to environmental obligations litigation regulatory proceedings product quality and losses resulting from other events and developments 

the preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenue and expenses and related disclosures as well as disclosures about any contingent assets and liabilities we base these estimates and judgments on historical experience and other assumptions and information that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances estimates and assumptions about future events and their effects are subject to uncertainty and accordingly these estimates may change as new events occur as more experience is acquired as additional information is obtained and as the business environment in which we operate changes 

allowance for credit losses 

the estimation of anticipated credit losses that may be incurred as we work through the invoice collection process with our customers requires us to make judgments and estimates regarding our customers ability to pay amounts due to us we monitor our customers payment history and current credit worthiness to determine that collectability is reasonably assured we also consider the overall business climate in which our customers operate for accounts receivable a loss allowance matrix is utilized to measure lifetime expected credit losses the matrix contemplates historical credit losses by age of receivables adjusted for any forwardlooking information and management expectations at december 31 2020 and 2019 the allowance for credit losses totaled 373 million and 323 million of total gross accounts receivable respectively we believe that our allowance for credit losses is adequate to cover the anticipated credit losses under current conditions however uncertainties regarding changes in the financial condition of our customers either adverse or positive could impact the amount and timing of any additional credit losses that may be required 

inventory reserves 

inventory is a significant component of current assets and is stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value this requires us to record provisions and maintain reserves for excess slow moving and obsolete inventory to determine these reserve amounts we regularly review inventory quantities on hand and compare them to estimates of future product demand market conditions production requirements and technological developments these estimates and forecasts inherently include uncertainties and require us to make judgments regarding potential future outcomes at december 31 2020 and 2019 inventory reserves totaled 421 million and 429 million of gross inventory respectively we believe that our reserves are adequate to properly value potential excess slow moving and obsolete inventory under current conditions significant or unanticipated changes to our estimates and forecasts could impact the amount and timing of any additional provisions for excess slow moving or obsolete inventory that may be required

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we are exposed to certain market risks that are inherent in our financial instruments and arise from changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates we may enter into derivative financial instrument transactions to manage or reduce market risk but do not enter into derivative financial instrument transactions for speculative purposes a discussion of our primary market risk exposure in financial instruments is presented below 

interest rate risk 

all of our longterm debt is comprised of fixed rate instruments we are subject to interest rate risk on our debt and investment portfolio we may use interest rate swaps to manage the economic effect of fixed rate obligations associated with certain debt there were no outstanding interest rate swap agreements as of december 31 2020 the following table sets forth our fixed rate longterm debt excluding finance leases and the related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates 



1 fair market value of our fixed rate longterm debt excluding finance leases was 75 billion at december 31 2020 

2 amounts represent the principal value of our longterm debt outstanding and related weighted average interest rates at the end of the respective period 

baker hughes company 2020 form 10k  44 

foreign currency exchange risk 

we conduct our operations around the world in a number of different currencies and we are exposed to market risks resulting from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates many of our significant foreign subsidiaries have designated the local currency as their functional currency as such future earnings are subject to change due to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates when transactions are denominated in currencies other than our functional currencies 

additionally we buy manufacture and sell components and products across global markets these activities expose us to changes in foreign currency exchange rates commodity prices and interest rates which can adversely affect revenue earned and costs of our operating businesses when the currency in which equipment is sold differs from the primary currency of the legal entity and the exchange rate fluctuates it will affect the revenue earned on the sale these sales and purchase transactions also create receivables and payables denominated in foreign currencies and exposure to foreign currency gains and losses based on changes in exchange rates changes in the price of raw materials used in manufacturing can affect the cost of manufacturing we use derivatives to mitigate or eliminate these exposures where appropriate 

we use cash flow hedging primarily to reduce or eliminate the effects of foreign currency exchange rate changes on purchase and sale contracts accordingly most derivative activity in this category consists of currency exchange contracts we had outstanding foreign currency forward contracts with notional amounts aggregating 68 billion and 53 billion to hedge exposure to currency fluctuations in various foreign currencies at december 31 2020 and 2019 respectively the notional amount of these derivative instruments do not generally represent cash amounts exchanged by us and the counterparties but rather the nominal amount upon which changes in the value of the derivatives are measured 

as of december 31 2020 the company estimates that a 1 appreciation or depreciation in the us dollar would result in an impact of less than 5 million to our pretax earnings however the company is generally able to mitigate its foreign exchange exposure where there are liquid financial markets through use of foreign currency derivative transactions also see note 16 financial instruments of the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 herein which has additional details on our strategy

baker hughes company 2019 form 10k  6 

we strive to negotiate the terms of our customer contracts consistent with what we consider to be industry best practices our customers typically indemnify us for certain claims arising from the injury or death of their employees and often their other contractors the loss of or damage to their facility and equipment and often that of their other contractors pollution originating from their equipment or facility and all liabilities related to the well and subsurface operations including loss or damage to the well or reservoir loss of well control fire explosion or any uncontrolled flow of oil or gas conversely we typically indemnify our customers for certain claims arising from the injury or death of our employees and sometimes that of our subcontractors the loss of or damage to our equipment and pollution originating from our equipment above the surface of the earth while under our control where the above indemnities do not apply or are not consistent with industry best practices we typically provide a capped indemnity for damages caused to the customer by our negligence and include an overall limitation of liability clause it is also our general practice to include a limitation of liability for consequential loss including loss of profits and loss of revenue in all customer contracts 

our indemnity structure may not protect us in every case certain us states have enacted oil and natural gas specific antiindemnity statutes that can void the allocation of liability agreed to in a contract state law laws in countries outside the us public policy or the negotiated terms of a customer contract may also limit indemnity obligations in the event of the gross negligence or willful misconduct we sometimes contract with customers that are not the end user of our products it is our practice to seek to obtain an indemnity from our customer for any enduser claims but this is not always possible similarly government agencies and other third parties including in some cases other contractors of our customers may make claims in respect of which we are not indemnified and for which responsibility is assessed proportionate to fault deviations from our standard contracting practices are examined through an established risk deviation process 

the company maintains a commercial general liability insurance policy program that covers against certain operating hazards including product liability claims and personal injury claims as well as certain limited environmental pollution claims for damage to a third party or its property arising out of contact with pollution for which the company is liable however clean up and well control costs are not covered by such program all of the insurance policies purchased by the company are subject to deductible andor selfinsured retention amounts for which we are responsible for payment specific terms conditions limitations and exclusions there can be no assurance that the nature and amount of company insurance will be sufficient to fully indemnify us against liabilities related to our business

raw materials 

we purchase various raw materials and component parts for use in manufacturing our products and delivering our services the principal raw materials we use include steel alloys chromium nickel titanium barite beryllium copper lead tungsten carbide synthetic and natural diamonds gels sand and other proppants printed circuit boards and other electronic components and hydrocarbonbased chemical feed stocks raw materials that are essential to our business are normally readily available from multiple sources but may be subject to price volatility market conditions can trigger constraints in the supply of certain raw materials and we are always seeking ways to ensure the availability and manage the cost of raw materials our procurement department uses its size and buying power to enhance its access to key materials at competitive prices 

in addition to raw materials and component parts we also use the products and services of metal fabricators machine shops foundries forge shops assembly operations contract manufacturers logistics providers packagers indirect material providers and others in order to produce and deliver products to customers these materials and services are generally available from multiple sources 

employees 

as of december 31 2019  we had approximately 68000 employees of which the majority are outside the us approximately 10 of these employees are represented under collective bargaining agreements or similartype labor arrangements 

environmental matters 

we are committed to the health and safety of people protection of the environment and compliance with environmental laws regulations and our policies our past and present operations include activities that are subject to extensive domestic including us federal state and local and international regulations with regard to air land and water quality and other environmental matters regulations continue to evolve and changes in standards of enforcement of existing regulations as well as the enactment of new legislation may require us and our customers to modify supplement or replace equipment or facilities or to change or discontinue present methods of operation our environmental compliance expenditures and our capital costs for environmental control equipment may change accordingly 

we recognize that environmental challenges including climate change warrant meaningful action in 2019 we announced our commitment to reduce our carbon equivalent emissions 50 by 2030 and achieve net zero by 2050 this goal encompasses emissions from our direct operations scope 1 and 2 emissions as compared to our baseline year of 2012 and was set to align with the paris accord and the specific recommendations of the united nations un intergovernmental panel on climate change’s special report on global warming of 15 o c we have proactively worked to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions over the last decade and continue efforts to reduce our overall environmental footprint by using materials wisely and preserving land water and air quality our sustainability commitments include our formal participation in the un global compact which commenced in 2019 and requires annual communication of progress this compact requires commitment to the un sustainable development goals and ten principles including a precautionary approach to environmental challenges initiatives to promote a greater sense of environmental responsibility and the development of environmentally friendly technologies 

while we seek to embed and verify sound environmental practices throughout our business we are and may in the future be involved in voluntary remediation projects at current and former properties typically related to historical operations on rare occasions our remediation activities are conducted as specified by a government agencyissued consent decree or agreed order remediation costs at these properties are accrued using currently available facts existing environmental permits technology and presently enacted laws and regulations for sites where we are primarily responsible for the remediation our cost estimates are developed based on internal evaluations and are not discounted we record accruals when it is probable that we will be obligated to pay amounts for environmental site evaluation remediation or related activities and such amounts can be reasonably estimated accruals are recorded even if significant uncertainties exist over the ultimate cost of the remediation ongoing environmental compliance costs such as obtaining environmental permits installation and maintenance of pollution control equipment and waste disposal are expensed as incurred 

baker hughes company 2019 form 10k  9 

the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act known as superfund imposes liability for the release of a hazardous substance into the environment superfund liability is imposed without regard to fault even if the waste disposal was in compliance with laws and regulations we have been identified as a potentially responsible party prp at various superfund sites and we accrue our share of the estimated remediation costs for the site prps in superfund actions have joint and several liability and may be required to pay more than their proportional share of such costs 

in some cases it is not possible to quantify our ultimate exposure because the projects are either in the investigative or early remediation stage or superfund allocation information is not yet available based upon current information we believe that our overall compliance with environmental regulations including remediation obligations environmental compliance costs and capital expenditures for environmental control equipment will not have a material adverse effect on our capital expenditures earnings or competitive position because we have either established adequate reserves or our compliance cost based on available information is not expected to be material to our consolidated and combined financial statements our total accrual for environmental remediation was 82 million and 84 million at december 31 2019 and 2018  respectively we continue to focus on reducing future environmental liabilities by maintaining appropriate company standards and by improving our assurance programs

 item 1a risk factors 

an investment in our common stock involves various risks when considering an investment in the company one should carefully consider all of the risk factors described below as well as other information included and incorporated by reference in this annual report there may be additional risks uncertainties and matters not listed below that we are unaware of or that we currently consider immaterial any of these may adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows and thus the value of an investment in the company 

risk factors related to our business 

we operate in a highly competitive environment which may adversely affect our ability to succeed 

we operate in a highly competitive environment for marketing oilfield products and services and securing equipment and trained personnel our ability to continually provide competitive products and services can impact our ability to defend maintain or increase prices for our products and services maintain market share and negotiate acceptable contract terms with our customers in order to be competitive we must provide new technologies reliable products and services that perform as expected and that create value for our customers and successfully recruit train and retain competent personnel 

in addition our investments in new technologies and properties plants and equipment may not provide competitive returns our ability to defend maintain or increase prices for our products and services is in part dependent on the industry’s capacity relative to customer demand and on our ability to differentiate the value delivered by our products and services from our competitors’ products and services managing development of competitive technology and new product introductions on a forecasted schedule and at a forecasted cost can impact our financial results if we are unable to continue to develop and produce competitive technology or deliver it to our clients in a timely and costcompetitive manner in various markets in which we operate or if competing technology accelerates the obsolescence of any of our products or services any competitive advantage that we may hold and in turn our business financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected we are also developing artificial intelligence products and services with a third party there are no assurances that we will be able to successfully develop an artificial intelligence platform that will effectively address the artificial intelligence related needs of our customers in addition the agreement with the third party is subject to term limitations and there are no assurances that a future agreement if any will have the same terms as the current agreement 

the high cost or unavailability of infrastructure materials equipment supplies and personnel could adversely affect our ability to execute our operations on a timely basis 

our manufacturing operations are dependent on having sufficient raw materials component parts and manufacturing capacity available to meet our manufacturing plans at a reasonable cost while minimizing inventories our ability to effectively manage our manufacturing operations and meet these goals can have an impact on our business including our ability to meet our manufacturing plans and revenue goals control costs and avoid shortages or oversupply of raw materials and component parts 

people are a key resource to developing manufacturing and delivering our products and services to our customers around the world our ability to manage the recruiting training retention and efficient usage of the highly skilled workforce required by our plans and to manage the associated costs could impact our business a welltrained motivated workforce has a positive impact on our ability to attract and retain business periods of rapid growth present a challenge to us and our industry to recruit train and retain our employees while also managing the impact of wage inflation and the limited available qualified labor in the markets where we operate

our business could be impacted by geopolitical and terrorism threats in countries where we or our customers do business and our business operations may be impacted by civil unrest government expropriations andor epidemic outbreaks 

geopolitical and terrorism risks continue to grow in a number of key countries where we currently or may in the future do business geopolitical and terrorism risks could lead to among other things a loss of our investment in the country impairment of the safety of our employees and impairment of our or our customers’ ability to conduct operations 

in addition to other geopolitical and terrorism risks civil unrest continues to grow in a number of key countries where we do business our ability to conduct business operations may be impacted by that civil unrest and our assets in these countries may also be subject to expropriation by governments or other parties involved in civil unrest epidemic outbreaks may also impact our business operations by among other things restricting travel to protect the health and welfare of our employees and decisions by our customers to curtail or stop operations in impacted areas 

compliance with and changes in laws could be costly and could affect operating results in addition government disruptions could negatively impact our ability to conduct our business 

we have operations in the united states and in more than 120 countries that can be impacted by expected and unexpected changes in the legal and business environments in which we operate compliancerelated issues could also limit our ability to do business in certain countries and impact our earnings changes that could impact the legal environment include new legislation new regulations new policies investigations and legal proceedings and new interpretations of existing legal rules and regulations in particular changes in export control laws or exchange control laws additional restrictions on doing business in countries subject to sanctions and changes in laws in countries where we operate in addition changes and uncertainty in the political environments in which our businesses operate can have a material effect on the laws rules and regulations that affect our operations government disruptions may also delay or halt the granting and renewal of permits licenses and other items required by us and our customers to conduct our business the continued success of our global business and operations depends in part on our ability to continue to anticipate and effectively manage these and other political legal and regulatory risks 

increased cybersecurity requirements vulnerabilities threats and more sophisticated and targeted computer crime could pose risks to our systems networks products solutions services and data 

increased global cybersecurity vulnerabilities threats and more sophisticated and targeted cyberrelated attacks pose risks to our systems networks products solutions services and data cybersecurity attacks also pose risks to our customers’ partners’ suppliers’ and thirdparty service providers’ products systems and networks and the confidentiality availability and integrity of our and our customers’ data while we attempt to mitigate these risks we remain vulnerable to additional known or unknown threats given our global footprint the large number of customers with which we do business and the increasing sophistication of cyber attacks a cyber attack could occur and persist for an extended period of time without detection we expect that any investigation of a cyber attack would be inherently unpredictable and that it would take time before the completion of any investigation and before there is availability of full and reliable information during such time we would not necessarily know the extent of the harm or how best to remediate it and certain errors or actions could be repeated or compounded before they are discovered and remediated all or any of which would further increase the costs and consequences of a cyber attack 

we also may have access to sensitive confidential or personal data or information in certain of our businesses that is subject to privacy and security laws regulations and customerimposed controls despite our efforts to protect sensitive confidential or personal data or information we may be vulnerable to material security breaches theft misplaced or lost data programming errors employee errors andor malfeasance that could potentially lead to the compromising of sensitive confidential or personal data or information improper use of our systems software solutions or networks unauthorized access use disclosure modification or destruction of information defective products production downtimes and operational disruptions in addition a cyberrelated attack could adversely impact our operating results and result in other negative consequences including damage to our reputation or competitiveness remediation or increased protection costs litigation or regulatory action fines and penalties

our failure to comply with the foreign corrupt practices act fcpa and other similar laws could have a negative impact on our ongoing operations 

our ability to comply with the fcpa the uk bribery act and various other antibribery and anticorruption laws depends on the success of our ongoing compliance program including our ability to successfully manage our agents distributors and other business partners and supervise train and retain competent employees we could be subject to sanctions and civil and criminal prosecution as well as fines and penalties in the event of a finding of a violation of any of these laws by us or any of our employees 

antimoney laundering and antiterrorism financing laws could have significant adverse consequences for us 

we maintain an enterprisewide program designed to enable us to comply with all applicable antimoney laundering and antiterrorism financing laws and regulations including the bank secrecy act and the patriot act this program includes policies procedures processes and other internal controls designed to identify monitor manage and mitigate the risk of money laundering or terrorist financing posed by our products services customers and geographic locale these controls establish procedures and processes to detect and report suspicious transactions perform customer due diligence respond to requests from law enforcement and meet all recordkeeping and reporting requirements related to particular transactions involving currency or monetary instruments we cannot be sure our programs and controls are or will remain effective to ensure our compliance with all applicable antimoney laundering and antiterrorism financing laws and regulations and our failure to comply could subject us to significant sanctions fines penalties and reputational harm all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

changes in tax laws tax rates tariffs adverse positions taken by taxing authorities and tax audits could impact operating results 

changes in tax laws tax rates tariffs changes in interpretation of tax laws the resolution of tax assessments or audits by various tax authorities and the ability to fully utilize tax loss carryforwards and tax credits could impact our operating results including additional valuation allowances for deferred tax assets in addition we may periodically restructure our legal entity organization if taxing authorities were to disagree with our tax positions in connection with any such restructurings our effective tax rate could be materially impacted 

our operations involve a variety of operating hazards and risks that could cause losses 

the products that we manufacture and the services that we provide are complex and the failure of our equipment to operate properly or to meet specifications may greatly increase our customers’ costs in addition many of these products are used in inherently hazardous industries such as the offshore oilfield business these hazards include blowouts explosions nuclearrelated events fires collisions capsizings and severe weather conditions we may incur substantial liabilities or losses as a result of these hazards our insurance and contractual indemnity protection may not be sufficient or effective to protect us under all circumstances or against all risks the occurrence of a significant event against which we were not fully insured or indemnified or the failure of a customer to meet its indemnification obligations to us could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

compliance with and rulings and litigation in connection with environmental and climate change regulations and the environmental and climate change impacts of our or our customers’ operations may adversely affect our business and operating results 

we and our business are impacted by material changes in environmental laws regulations rulings and litigation our expectations regarding our compliance with environmental laws and regulations and our expenditures to comply with environmental laws and regulations including without limitation our capital expenditures for environmental control equipment are only our forecasts regarding these matters these forecasts may be substantially different from actual results which may be affected by factors such as changes in law that impose restrictions on air emissions wastewater management waste disposal hydraulic fracturing or wetland and land use practices more stringent enforcement of existing environmental laws and regulations a change in our share of any remediation costs or other unexpected adverse outcomes with respect to sites where we have been named as a potentially responsible party including without limitation superfund sites the discovery of other sites where additional expenditures may be required to comply with environmental legal obligations and the accidental discharge of hazardous materials

international national and state governments and agencies continue to evaluate and promulgate legislation and regulations that are focused on restricting emissions commonly referred to as greenhouse gas ghg emissions in the united states the us environmental protection agency epa has taken steps to regulate ghg emissions as air pollutants under the us clean air act of 1970 as amended the epa’s greenhouse gas reporting rule requires monitoring and reporting of ghg emissions from among others certain mobile and stationary ghg emission sources in the oil and natural gas industry which in turn may include data from certain of our wellsite equipment and operations in addition the us government has proposed rules in the past setting ghg emission standards for or otherwise aimed at reducing ghg emissions from the oil and natural gas industry caps or fees on carbon emissions including in the united states have been and may continue to be established and the cost of such caps or fees could disproportionately affect the fossilfuel energy sector we are unable to predict whether and when the proposed changes in laws or regulations ultimately will occur or what they ultimately will require and accordingly we are unable to assess the potential financial or operational impact they may have on our business 

other developments focused on restricting ghg emissions include the united nations framework convention on climate change which includes the paris agreement and the kyoto protocol the european union emission trading system article 8 of the european union energy efficiency directive and the united kingdom’s energy savings opportunity schemeesos and in the united states the regional greenhouse gas initiative the western climate action initiative and various state programs implementing the california global warming solutions act of 2006 known as assembly bill 32 

the potential for climate related changes may pose future risks to our operations and those of our customers these changes can include extreme variability in weather patterns such as increased frequency of severe weather rising mean temperature and sea levels and longterm changes in precipitation patterns such changes have the potential to affect business continuity and operating results particularly at facilities in coastal areas 

regulatory requirements related to environmental social and governance esg or sustainability reporting have been issued in the european union that applies to financial market participants with implementation and enforcement expected in 2021 in the united states such regulations have been issued related to pension investments in california and for the responsible investment of public funds in illinois additional regulation is pending in other states we expect regulatory requirements related to esg matters to continue to expand globally the company is committed to transparent and comprehensive reporting of our sustainability performance and considers existing standards such as the global reporting initiative’s g4 guidelines the sustainability accounting standards board’s documentation international petroleum industry environmental conservation associations ipieca sustainability reporting guidance and recommendations issued by the task force for climate related financial disclosures if we are not able to meet future sustainability reporting requirements of regulators or current and future expectations of investors customers or other stakeholders our business and ability to raise capital may be adversely affected 

uninsured claims and litigation against us could adversely impact our operating results 

we could be impacted by the outcome of pending litigation as well as unexpected litigation or proceedings while we have insurance coverage against operating hazards including product liability claims and personal injury claims related to our products to the extent deemed prudent by our management and to the extent insurance is available no assurance can be given that the nature and amount of that insurance will be sufficient to fully indemnify us against liabilities arising out of pending and future claims and litigation 

control of oil and natural gas reserves by stateowned oil companies may impact the demand for our services and products and create additional risks in our operations 

much of the world’s oil and natural gas reserves are controlled by stateowned oil companies stateowned oil companies may require their contractors to meet local content requirements or other local standards such as conducting our operations through joint ventures with local partners that could be difficult or undesirable for us to meet the failure to meet the local content requirements and other local standards may adversely impact our operations in those countries in addition our ability to work with stateowned oil companies is subject to our ability to negotiate and agree upon acceptable contract terms 

baker hughes company 2019 form 10k  15 

providing services on an integrated or turnkey basis could require us to assume additional risks 

we may enter into integrated contracts or turnkey contracts with our customers and we may choose to provide services outside our core business providing services on an integrated or turnkey basis may subject us to additional risks such as costs associated with unexpected delays or difficulties in drilling or completion operations and risks associated with subcontracting arrangements 

some of our customers require bids in the form of fixed pricing contracts 

some of our customers require bids for contracts in the form of fixed pricing contracts that may require us to provide integrated project management services outside our normal discrete business and to act as project managers as well as service providers and may require us to assume additional risks associated with cost overruns 

we sometimes enter into consortium or similar arrangements for certain projects which could impose additional costs and obligations on us 

we sometimes enter into consortium or similar arrangements for certain projects under such arrangements each party is responsible for performing a certain scope of work within the total scope of the contracted work and the obligations expire when all contractual obligations are completed the failure or inability financially or otherwise of any of the parties to perform their obligations could impose additional costs and obligations on us these factors could result in unanticipated costs to complete the project liquidated damages or contract disputes 

the credit risks of having a concentrated customer base in the energy industry could result in losses 

having a concentration of customers in the energy industry may impact our overall exposure to credit risk as our customers may be similarly affected by prolonged changes in economic and industry conditions some of our customers may experience extreme financial distress as a result of falling commodity prices and may be forced to seek protection under applicable bankruptcy laws which may affect our ability to recover any amounts due from such customers furthermore countries that rely heavily upon income from hydrocarbon exports have been and may in the future be negatively and significantly affected by a drop in oil prices which could affect our ability to collect from our customers in these countries particularly national oil companies laws in some jurisdictions in which we will operate could make collection difficult or time consuming we will perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and do not expect to require collateral in support of our trade receivables while we maintain reserves for potential credit losses we cannot assure such reserves will be sufficient to meet writeoffs of uncollectible receivables or that our losses from such receivables will be consistent with our expectations additionally in the event of a bankruptcy of any of our customers we may be treated as an unsecured creditor and may collect substantially less or none of the amounts owed to us by such customer 

our remaining performance obligations rpo are subject to modification termination or reduction of orders which could negatively impact our sales 

our rpo is comprised of unfilled customer orders for products and product services expected life of contract sales for product services our rpo can be significantly affected by the timing of orders for large projects although modifications and terminations of orders may be partially offset by cancellation fees customers can and sometimes do terminate or modify orders our failure to replace canceled orders could negatively impact our sales and results of operations the total dollar amount of the company’s rpo as of december 31 2019 was 229 billion  

we may not be able to satisfy technical requirements testing requirements or other specifications required under our service contracts and equipment purchase agreements 

our products are used in deepwater and other harsh environments and severe service applications our contracts with customers and customer requests for bids typically set forth detailed specifications or technical requirements for our products and services which may also include extensive testing requirements we anticipate that such testing requirements will become more common in our contracts in addition recent scrutiny of the offshore drilling industry has resulted in more stringent technical specifications for our products and more comprehensive testing requirements for our products to ensure compliance with such specifications we cannot provide assurance that our products will be able to satisfy the specifications or that we will be able to perform the 

baker hughes company 2019 form 10k  16 

fullscale testing necessary to prove that the product specifications are satisfied in future contract bids or under existing contracts or that the costs of modifications to our products to satisfy the specifications and testing will not adversely affect our results of operations 

currency fluctuations or devaluations may impact our operating results 

fluctuations or devaluations in foreign currencies relative to the us dollar can impact our revenue and our costs of doing business as well as the costs of doing business of our customers 

changes in economic andor market conditions may impact our ability to borrow andor cost of borrowing 

the condition of the capital markets and equity markets in general can affect the price of our common stock and our ability to obtain financing if necessary if our credit rating is ever downgraded it could increase borrowing costs under credit facilities and commercial paper programs as well as increase the cost of renewing or obtaining or make it more difficult to renew obtain or issue new debt financing 

an inability to obtain maintain protect or enforce our intellectual property rights could adversely affect our business 

there can be no assurance that the steps we take to obtain maintain protect and enforce our intellectual property rights will be completely adequate our intellectual property rights may fail to provide us with significant competitive advantages particularly in foreign jurisdictions where we have not invested in an intellectual property portfolio or that do not have or do not enforce strong intellectual property rights the weakening of protection of our trademarks patents and other intellectual property rights could also adversely affect our business 

we are a party to a number of licenses that give us rights to intellectual property that is necessary or useful to our business our success depends in part on the ability of our licensors to obtain maintain protect and sufficiently enforce the licensed intellectual property rights we have commercialized without protection for the intellectual property rights we license other companies might be able to offer substantially identical products for sale which could adversely affect our competitive business position and harm our business products also there can be no assurances that we will be able to obtain or renew from third parties the licenses to use intellectual property rights we need in the future and there is no assurance that such licenses can be obtained on reasonable terms we would be adversely affected in the event that any such license agreement was terminated without the right for us to continue using the licensed intellectual property 

we may be subject to litigation if another party claims that we have infringed upon misappropriated or otherwise violated its intellectual property rights 

the tools techniques methodologies programs and components we use to provide our products and services may infringe upon misappropriate or otherwise violate the intellectual property rights of others or be challenged on that basis regardless of the merits any such claims may result in significant legal and other costs and may distract management from running our core business resolving such claims could increase our costs including through royalty payments to acquire licenses if available from third parties and through the development of replacement technologies if a license to resolve a claim were not available we might not be able to continue providing a particular service or product which could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

the effects of brexit may have a negative impact on our financial results and operations of the business 

united kingdom has exited brexit the european union eu on january 31 2020 as per the terms of the exit the uk has ceased to be an eu member but will continue to follow its rules and contribute to its budget for an 11 month transition period ending december 31 2020 the purpose of the transition period is to give time for the uk and eu to negotiate their future relationship including a trade deal there remains significant uncertainty on the outcome of the negotiations and the terms of a future trade deal if any this uncertainty could harm our business and financial results due to fluctuations in the value of the british pound versus the us dollar euro and other currencies in addition brexit could result in delayed deliveries which may impact our internal supply chain and our customer projects

risk factors related to the worldwide oil and natural gas industry 

volatility of oil and natural gas prices can adversely affect demand for our products and services 

prices of oil and gas products are set on a commodity basis as a result the volatility in oil and natural gas prices can impact our customers’ activity levels and spending for our products and services current energy prices are important contributors to cash flow for our customers and their ability to fund exploration and development activities expectations about future prices and price volatility are important for determining future spending levels 

demand for oil and natural gas is subject to factors beyond our control which may adversely affect our operating results changes in the global economy could impact our customers’ spending levels and our revenue and operating results 

demand for oil and natural gas as well as the demand for our services and products is highly correlated with global economic growth a prolonged reduction in oil and natural gas prices may require us to record additional asset impairments such a potential impairment charge could have a material adverse impact on our operating results 

requirements and voluntary initiatives to reduce greenhouse gas emissions as well as increased climate change awareness are likely to result in increased costs for the oil and gas industry to curb greenhouse gas emissions and could have an adverse impact on demand for oil and natural gas 

international national and state governments agencies and bodies continue to evaluate and promulgate regulations and voluntary initiatives that are focused on restricting ghg emissions these requirements and initiatives are likely to become more stringent over time and to result in increased costs for the oil and gas industry to curb ghg emissions in addition these developments and public perception relating to climate change may curtail production and demand for hydrocarbons such as oil and natural gas by shifting demand towards and investment in relatively lower carbon energy sources such as wind solar and other renewables the renewable energy industry is developing enhanced technologies and becoming more competitive with fossilfuel energy if renewable energy becomes more competitive than fossilfuel energy particularly during periods of higher oil and natural gas prices it could have a material effect on our results of operations 

supply of oil and natural gas is subject to factors beyond our control which may adversely affect our operating results 

productive capacity for oil and natural gas is dependent on our customers’ decisions to develop and produce oil and natural gas reserves and on the regulatory environment in which our customers and we operate the ability to produce oil and natural gas can be affected by the number and productivity of new wells drilled and completed as well as the rate of production and resulting depletion of existing wells 

our customers’ activity levels and spending for our products and services and ability to pay amounts owed us could be impacted by the reduction of their cash flow and the ability of our customers to access equity or credit markets 

our customers’ access to capital is dependent on their ability to access the funds necessary to develop economically attractive projects based upon their expectations of future energy prices required investments and resulting returns limited access to external sources of funding has caused and may continue to cause customers to reduce their capital spending plans to levels supported by internally generated cash flow in addition a reduction of cash flow resulting from declines in commodity prices a reduction in borrowing bases under reservebased credit facilities or the lack of available debt or equity financing may impact the ability of our customers to pay amounts owed to us and could cause us to increase our reserve for doubtful accounts 

seasonal and weather conditions could adversely affect demand for our services and operations 

variation from normal weather patterns such as cooler or warmer summers and winters can have a significant impact on demand for our services and operations adverse weather conditions such as hurricanes in the gulf of mexico may interrupt or curtail our operations or our customers’ operations cause supply disruptions and result in a loss of revenue and damage to our equipment and facilities which may or may not be insured for example extreme winter conditions in canada russia or the north sea may interrupt or curtail our operations or our customers’ operations in those areas and result in a loss of revenue

risk factors related to the separation from ge 

we may experience challenges relating to the separation from ge and the anticipated benefits from the master agreement framework and the omnibus agreement 

if we experience difficulties with the separation from ge the anticipated benefits of the master agreement framework and the omnibus agreement may not be realized fully or at all may take longer to realize than expected or may be offset by the decrease in business from certain customers or other negative impacts the impact of the separation from ge could have an adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition or other prospects on an ongoing basis 

we have incurred and expect to continue to incur additional costs in connection with the separation from ge the master agreement framework and the omnibus agreement 

actual costs related to the separation and the implementation of the changes contemplated by the master agreement framework and the omnibus agreement may be higher than anticipated and we may experience additional difficulties in effecting such changes 

we are also a party to a number of licenses with ge that give us rights to intellectual property that is necessary or useful to our business we would be adversely affected in the event these agreements were terminated without the right for us to continue accessing and using such licensed intellectual property as we might continue to improve current products and services or develop new ones

the market price of our class a common stock could be materially impacted due to the substantial number of shares of our capital stock eligible for sale in any future offerings by ge 

ge and its affiliates beneficially owned assuming full exchange of its shares of class b common stock pursuant to the exchange agreement as of december 31 2019 approximately 367 of our outstanding class a common stock pursuant to the amended and restated registration rights agreement dated july 31 2019 as further amended from time to time ge has the right to cause us in certain instances at our expense to register resales of our class a common stock held by ge under the securities act these shares also may be sold pursuant to rule 144 under the securities act subject to restrictions while ge is deemed to be our affiliate future sales of a substantial number of shares of our class a common stock in the public market or the perception that these sales could occur could substantially decrease the market price of our class a common stock we cannot assure you if or when any future offerings or resales of these shares may occur

completed and ge’s ownership of baker hughes was reduced from approximately 503 to approximately 368 as of december 31 2019  ges interest in us was 367  

in aggregate we anticipate that the net financial impact of the agreements contemplated by the master agreement framework will have a slightly negative impact on our operating margin rates of approximately 20 to 40 basis points in addition we expect to incur onetime charges related to the separation from ge of approximately 02 billion to 03 billion over three years we expect these charges to be primarily related to the buildout of information technology infrastructure as well as customary transaction fees for a discussion of certain risks associated with separation including risks related to our business financial condition and results of operations see “item 1a risk factorsrisk factors related to the separation from ge” 

outlook 

our business is exposed to a number of different macro factors which influence our expectations and outlook all of our outlook expectations are purely based on the market as we see it today and are subject to change given volatile conditions in the industry 

 we have other segments in our portfolio that are more correlated with different industrial metrics such as our digital solutions business overall we believe our portfolio is uniquely positioned to compete across the value chain and deliver comprehensive solutions for our customers we remain optimistic about the longterm economics of the industry but are continuing to operate with flexibility given our expectations for volatility and changing assumptions in the near term 

while governments may change or may not continue incentives for renewable energy additions in the long term renewables cost decline may accelerate to compete with newbuilt fossil capacity however we do not anticipate any significant impacts to our business in the foreseeable future 

despite the nearterm volatility the longterm outlook for our industry remains positive we believe the world’s demand for energy will continue to rise and the supply of energy will continue to increase in complexity requiring greater service intensity and more advanced technology from oilfield service companies as such we remain focused on delivering innovative costefficient solutions that deliver step changes in operating and economic performance for our customers

business environment 

the following discussion and analysis summarizes the significant factors affecting our results of operations financial condition and liquidity position as of and for the year ended december 31 2019 and 2018  and should be read in conjunction with the consolidated and combined financial statements and related notes of the company 

we operate in more than 120 countries helping customers find evaluate drill produce transport and process hydrocarbon resources our revenue is predominately generated from the sale of products and services to major national and independent oil and natural gas companies worldwide and is dependent on spending by our customers for oil and natural gas exploration field development and production this spending is driven by a number of factors including our customers forecasts of future energy demand and supply their access to resources to develop and produce oil and natural gas their ability to fund their capital programs the impact of new government regulations and most importantly their expectations for oil and natural gas prices as a key driver of their cash flows 

oil and natural gas prices 

oil and natural gas prices are summarized in the table below as averages of the daily closing prices during each of the periods indicated 



 outside north america customer spending is most heavily influenced by brent oil prices after a volatile fourth quarter of 2018 when oil prices dropped nearly 40 there was more stability and positive sentiment at the start of 2019 brent oil prices increased from a low of 5323bbl in january 2019 to a high of 7494bbl in april 2019 however the average brent oil prices decreased to 6428bbl in 2019 from 7134bbl in 2018 primarily due to higher prices in the first three quarters of 2018 

in north america customer spending is highly driven by wti oil prices which similar to brent oil prices on average decreased to 5698bbl in 2019 from 6523bbl in 2018 and ranged from a low of 4631bbl in january 2019 to a high of 6624bbl in april 2019 

in north america natural gas prices as measured by the henry hub natural gas spot price averaged 256mmbtu in 2019 representing a 19 decrease over the prior year throughout the year henry hub natural gas spot prices ranged from a high of 425mmbtu in march 2019 to a low of 175mmbtu in december 2019 according to the us department of energy doe working natural gas in storage at the end of 2019 was 3192 billion cubic feet bcf which was 153 or 487 bcf above the corresponding week in 2018 

baker hughes rig count 

the baker hughes rig counts are an important business barometer for the drilling industry and its suppliers when drilling rigs are active they consume products and services produced by the oil service industry rig count trends are driven by the exploration and development spending by oil and natural gas companies which in turn is influenced by current and future price expectations for oil and natural gas the counts may reflect the relative strength and stability of energy prices and overall market activity however these counts should not be solely relied on as other specific and pervasive conditions may exist that affect overall energy prices and market activity 

we have been providing rig counts to the public since 1944 we gather all relevant data through our field service personnel who obtain the necessary data from routine visits to the various rigs customers contractors and 

baker hughes company 2019 form 10k  29 

other outside sources as necessary we base the classification of a well as either oil or natural gas primarily upon filings made by operators in the relevant jurisdiction this data is then compiled and distributed to various wire services and trade associations and is published on our website we believe the counting process and resulting data is reliable however it is subject to our ability to obtain accurate and timely information rig counts are compiled weekly for the us and canada and monthly for all international rigs published international rig counts do not include rigs drilling in certain locations such as russia the caspian region and onshore china because this information is not readily available 

beginning in the second quarter of 2019 ukraine was added to the baker hughes international rig count the company will continue tracking active drilling rigs in the country going forward historical periods will not be updated 

rigs in the us and canada are counted as active if on the day the count is taken the well being drilled has been started but drilling has not been completed and the well is anticipated to be of sufficient depth to be a potential consumer of our drill bits in international areas rigs are counted on a weekly basis and deemed active if drilling activities occurred during the majority of the week the weekly results are then averaged for the month and published accordingly the rig count does not include rigs that are in transit from one location to another rigging up being used in nondrilling activities including production testing completion and workover and are not expected to be significant consumers of drill bits 

the rig counts are summarized in the table below as averages for each of the periods indicated 



2019 compared to 2018 

overall the rig count was 2174 in 2019  a decrease of 2 as compared to 2018 due primarily to north american activity the rig count in north america decreased 12 in 2019 compared to 2018  as a result of lower commodity prices and exploration and production capital expenditure reductions internationally the rig count increased 11 in 2019 as compared to the same period last year excluding ukraine the international rig count was up 6 when compared to the same period last year 

within north america the decrease was primarily driven by the canadian rig count which was down 30 on average when compared to the same period last year and a decrease in the us rig count which was down 9 on average internationally the improvement in the rig count was driven primarily by increases in the europe region of 72 primarily related to the addition of ukraine during the second quarter of 2019 excluding ukraine the rig count in the europe region was up 15 the africa region and middle east region were also up by 19 and 5 respectively 

results of operations 

the discussions below relating to significant line items from our consolidated and combined statements of income loss are based on available information and represent our analysis of significant changes or events that impact the comparability of reported amounts where appropriate we have identified specific events and changes that affect comparability or trends and where reasonably practicable have quantified the impact of such items in addition the discussions below for revenue and cost of revenue are on a total basis as the business drivers for product sales and services are similar all dollar amounts in tabulations in this section are in millions of dollars unless otherwise stated certain columns and rows may not add due to the use of rounded numbers 

baker hughes company 2019 form 10k  30 

our results of operations are evaluated by the chief executive officer on a consolidated basis as well as at the segment level the performance of our operating segments is evaluated based on segment operating income loss which is defined as income loss before income taxes and equity in loss of affiliate and before the following net interest expense net other non operating income corporate expenses restructuring impairment and other charges inventory impairment separation and merger related costs and certain gains and losses not allocated to the operating segments 

in evaluating the segment performance the company uses the following 

volume volume is the increase or decrease in products andor services sold periodoverperiod excluding the impact of foreign exchange and price the volume impact on profit is calculated by multiplying the prior period profit rate by the change in revenue volume between the current and prior period it also includes price defined as the change in sales price for a comparable product or service periodoverperiod and is calculated as the periodoverperiod change in sales prices of comparable products and services 

foreign exchange fx fx measures the translational foreign exchange impact or the translation impact of the periodoverperiod change on sales and costs directly attributable to change in the foreign exchange rate compared to the us dollar fx impact is calculated by multiplying the functional currency amounts revenue or profit with the periodoverperiod fx rate variance using the average exchange rate for the respective period 

inflationdeflation inflationdeflation is defined as the increase or decrease in direct and indirect costs of the same type for an equal amount of volume it is calculated as the yearoveryear change in cost ie price paid of direct material compensation  benefits and overhead costs 

productivity productivity is measured by the remaining variance in profit after adjusting for the periodoverperiod impact of volume  price foreign exchange and inflationdeflation as defined above improved or lower periodoverperiod cost productivity is the result of cost efficiencies or inefficiencies such as cost decreasing or increasing more than volume or cost increasing or decreasing less than volume or changes in sales mix among segments this also includes the periodoverperiod variance of transactional foreign exchange aside from those foreign currency devaluations that are reported separately for business evaluation purposes 

orders and remaining performance obligations 

our statement of income loss displays sales and costs of sales in accordance with sec regulations under which “goods” is required to include all sales of tangible products and “services” must include all other sales including other services activities for the amounts shown below we distinguish between “equipment” and “product services” where product services refers to sales under product services agreements including sales of both goods such as spare parts and equipment upgrades and related services such as monitoring maintenance and repairs which is an important part of our operations we refer to “product services” simply as “services” within management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

orders  we recognized orders of 26973 million and 23904 million in 2019 and 2018  respectively in 2019  equipment orders were up 26 and service orders were up 3 compared to 2018  

remaining performance obligations rpo as of december 31 2019 and 2018  the aggregate amount of the transaction price allocated to the unsatisfied or partially unsatisfied performance obligations was 229 billion and 210 billion respectively

revenue and segment operating income before tax 

revenue and segment operating income for each of our four operating segments is provided below 



 fiscal year 2019 to fiscal year 2018 

revenue in 2019 was 23838 million  an increase of 961 million  or 4  from 2018  this increase in revenue was largely a result of increased activity in ofs and ofe partially offset by declines in tps and ds ofs increased 1272 million  ofe increased 280 million  tps decreased 479 million and ds decreased 112 million  

total segment operating income in 2019 was 2035 million  an increase of 239 million  or 13  from 2018  the increase was primarily driven by ofs which increased 132 million  ofe which increased 55 million and tps which increased 98 million  partially offset by ds which decreased 47 million  

oilfield services 

ofs 2019 revenue was 12889 million  an increase of 1272 million from 2018  primarily as a result of increased international activity in 2019 compared to 2018 international revenue was 8293 million in 2019  an increase of 1386 million from 2018  with faster growth than the international rig count driven by activity in the 

baker hughes company 2019 form 10k  32 

middle east asia pacific and latin america north america revenue was 4596 million in 2019  a decrease of 114 million from 2018 driven by declining rig counts in north america 

ofs 2019 segment operating income was 917 million  compared to 785 million in 2018  the increase was primarily driven by higher volume and increased cost productivity 

oilfield equipment 

ofe 2019 revenue was 2921 million  an increase of 280 million  or 11  from 2018  the increase was primarily driven by higher volume in the subsea production systems business and subsea services business these increases were partially offset by lower volume in the flexible pipe business 

ofe 2019 segment operating income was 55 million  compared to breakeven in 2018  the increase was primarily driven by higher volume and increased cost productivity 

turbomachinery  process solutions 

tps 2019 revenue was 5536 million  a decrease of 479 million  or 8  from 2018  the decrease was primarily driven by lower equipment installation volume and business dispositions partially offset by higher contractual services revenue equipment revenue in 2019 represented 36 and service revenue represented 64 of total revenue 

tps 2019 segment operating income was 719 million  compared to 621 million in 2018  the increase in profitability was driven primarily by higher cost productivity and favorable business mix 

digital solutions 

ds 2019 revenue was 2492 million  a decrease of 112 million  or 4  from 2018  driven primarily by lower volume in bentley controls pipeline and process solutions and software businesses partially offset by higher volume in the measurement  sensing business 

ds 2019 segment operating income was 343 million  compared to 390 million in 2018  the decrease in profitability was driven by lower volume and negative cost productivity 

corporate 

in 2019  corporate expenses were 433 million  an increase of 28 million compared to 2018  primarily from the additional expenses related to the separation from ge 

restructuring impairment and other 

in 2019  we recognized 342 million in restructuring impairment and other charges a decrease of 91 million compared to 2018 this decrease was primarily due to the accelerated amortization costs in 2018 that did not repeat in 2019 and reduced integration related restructuring activities partially offset by additional charges in our ofs segment focused on supply chain optimization improving asset utilization and driving down product and service delivery costs 

separation and merger related 

we recorded 184 million of separation and merger related costs in 2019  an increase of 31 million from the prior year costs in 2019 primarily relate to the finalization of the master agreement framework and the ongoing activities related to the separation from ge in 2018 separation and merger related costs primarily included costs associated with the integration of bhi 

interest expense net 

in 2019  we incurred net interest expense of 237 million  an increase of 14 million from the prior year primarily driven by costs associated with refinancing our senior notes due august 2021 and lower interest income 

baker hughes company 2019 form 10k  33 

equity in loss of affiliate 

as we have discontinued applying the equity method on our investment in bj services we did not record any gain or loss during 2019 compared to a loss of 139 million in 2018 we will resume application of the equity method only after our share of unrecognized net income equals our share of net loss not recognized during the period the equity method was suspended 

income tax 

in 2019  our income tax expense increased by 224 million  from 258 million in 2018 to 482 million in 2019  the increase was primarily due to higher foreign taxes related to increased foreign earnings and geographical mix of earnings 

compliance 

we in the conduct of all of our activities are committed to maintaining the core values of our company as well as high safety ethical and quality standards standards as also reported in our quality management system qms we believe such a commitment is integral to running a sound successful and sustainable business to ensure that we live up to our high standards we devote significant resources to maintain a comprehensive global ethics and compliance program compliance program which is designed to prevent detect and appropriately respond in a timely fashion to any potential violations of the law our way the baker hughes code of conduct and other company policies and procedures 

highlights of our compliance program include the following 



baker hughes company 2019 form 10k  34 



liquidity and capital resources 

our objective in financing our business is to maintain sufficient liquidity adequate financial resources and financial flexibility in order to fund the requirements of our business at december 31 2019  we had cash and cash equivalents of 3249 million compared to 3723 million at december 31 2018  cash and cash equivalents includes 162 million and 747 million of cash held on behalf of ge at december 31 2019 and 2018  respectively 

excluding cash held on behalf of ge our us subsidiaries held approximately 04 billion and 07 billion while our foreign subsidiaries held approximately 27 billion and 23 billion of our cash and cash equivalents as at december 31 2019 and 2018  respectively a substantial portion of the cash held by foreign subsidiaries at december 31 2019 has been reinvested in active nonus business operations if we decide at a later date to repatriate those funds to the us they will generally be free of us federal tax but may incur other taxes such as withholding or state taxes 

in december 2019 bhge llc entered into a 3 billion committed unsecured revolving credit facility the 2019 credit agreement with commercial banks maturing in december 2024 the 2019 credit agreement contains certain customary representations and warranties certain customary affirmative covenants and certain customary negative covenants upon the occurrence of certain events of default bhge llcs obligations under the 2019 credit agreement may be accelerated such events of default include payment defaults to lenders under the 2019 credit agreement and other customary defaults no such events of default have occurred in connection with bhge llc’s entry into the 2019 credit agreement bhge llc terminated its thenexisting fiveyear committed 3 billion revolving credit agreement dated as of july 3 2017 the 2017 credit agreement during 2019 and 2018 there were no borrowings under the 2019 or 2017 credit agreement 

bhge llc has a commercial paper program under which it may issue from time to time up to 3 billion in commercial paper with maturities of no more than 397 days at december 31 2019  we had no borrowings outstanding under the commercial paper program 

if market conditions were to change and our revenue was reduced significantly or operating costs were to increase our cash flows and liquidity could be reduced additionally it could cause the rating agencies to lower our credit rating there are no ratings triggers that would accelerate the maturity of any borrowings under our committed credit facility however a downgrade in our credit ratings could increase the cost of borrowings under the credit facility and could also limit or preclude our ability to issue commercial paper should this occur we could seek alternative sources of funding including borrowing under the credit facility 

during the year ended december 31 2019  we used cash to fund a variety of activities including certain working capital needs and restructuring costs capital expenditures the repayment of debt payment of dividends distributions to ge and share repurchases we believe that cash on hand cash flows generated from operations and the available credit facility will provide sufficient liquidity to manage our global cash needs 

baker hughes company 2019 form 10k  35 

cash flows 

cash flows provided by used in each type of activity were as follows for the years ended december 31 



fiscal year 2019 to fiscal year 2018 

operating activities 

our largest source of operating cash is payments from customers of which the largest component is collecting cash related to our sales of products and services including advance payments or progress collections for work to be performed the primary use of operating cash is to pay our suppliers employees tax authorities and others for a wide range of goods and services 

cash flows from operating activities generated cash of 2126 million and 1762 million for the years ended december 31 2019 and 2018  respectively cash flows from operating activities increased 364 million in 2019 primarily driven by improved operating performance these cash inflows were supported by 553 million of working capital generation mainly due to net positive progress collections and receivables in tps for equipment contracts as well as continued improvement in our working capital processes included in our cash flows from operating activities for 2019 and 2018 are payments of 307 million and 473 million respectively made primarily for employee severance as a result of our restructuring activities and separation and merger related costs including the buildout of information technology infrastructure as a result of ge separation activities 

investing activities 

cash flows from investing activities used cash of 1045 million and 578 million for the years ended december 31 2019 and 2018  respectively 

our principal recurring investing activity is the funding of capital expenditures to ensure that we have the appropriate levels and types of machinery and equipment in place to generate revenue from operations expenditures for capital assets totaled 1240 million and 995 million for 2019 and 2018  respectively partially offset by cash flows from the sale of property plant and equipment of 264 million and 458 million in 2019 and 2018  respectively proceeds from the disposal of assets related primarily to equipment that was lostinhole and to property machinery and equipment no longer used in operations that was sold throughout the period in 2019 we received 77 million from the sale of our highspeed reciprocating compression business in 2018 we received 453 million from the sale of businesses primarily driven by the sale of our natural gas solution ngs business for 375 million also in 2018 the company and adnoc signed a strategic partnership agreement under which we acquired a five percent stake in adnoc drilling for a cash consideration of 500 million 

financing activities 

cash flows from financing activities used cash of 1534 million and 4363 million for the years ended december 31 2019 and 2018  respectively

baker hughes company 2019 form 10k  36 

during 2018 we paid aggregate dividends of 315 million to our class a stockholders and bhge llc made a distribution of 495 million to ge we used cash of 387 million and 638 million respectively to repurchase and cancel our shares of class a and class b common stock and corresponding paired units in bhge llc on a pro rata basis additionally in november 2018 bhge llc repurchased 65 million units from ge for a cash consideration of 1461 million in total we returned 33 billion of cash to our shareholders through share buybacks dividends to our class a stockholders and distributions to ge 

we had net repayments of shortterm debt of 542 million and 376 million in 2019 and 2018  respectively repayment of our longterm debt of 570 million and 684 million in 2019 and 2018  respectively consisted primarily of repayment of certain senior notes 

in november 2019 bhge llc issued 525 million of 3138 senior notes due november 2029 we used the proceeds from this offering to repurchase all of our outstanding 32 senior notes due august 2021 

cash requirements 

in 2020  we believe cash on hand cash flows from operating activities the available revolving credit facility and availability under our existing shelf registrations of debt will provide us with sufficient capital resources and liquidity to manage our working capital needs meet contractual obligations fund capital expenditures and dividends and support the development of our shortterm and longterm operating strategies when necessary we issue commercial paper or other shortterm debt to fund cash needs in the us in excess of the cash generated in the us 

our capital expenditures can be adjusted and managed by us to match market demand and activity levels based on current market conditions capital expenditures net of proceeds from disposal of assets in 2020 will be made as appropriate at a rate that we estimate would equal up to 5 of annual revenue the expenditures are expected to be used primarily for normal recurring items necessary to support our business we also anticipate making income tax payments in the range of 500 million to 600 million in 2020  

contractual obligations 

in the table below we set forth our contractual obligations as of december 31 2019  certain amounts included in this table are based on our estimates and assumptions about these obligations including their duration anticipated actions by third parties and other factors the contractual obligations we will actually pay in future periods may vary from those reflected in the table because the estimates and assumptions are subjective 





baker hughes company 2019 form 10k  37 

 due to the uncertainty with respect to the timing of potential future cash outflows associated with our uncertain tax positions we are unable to make reasonable estimates of the period of cash settlement if any to the respective taxing authorities therefore 573 million in uncertain tax positions including interest and penalties have been excluded from the contractual obligations table above see note 13 income taxes of the notes to consolidated and combined financial statements in item 8 herein for further information 

we have certain defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans covering certain of our us and international employees during 2019  we made contributions and paid direct benefits of approximately 39 million in connection with those plans and we anticipate funding approximately 32 million during 2020  amounts for pension funding obligations are based on assumptions that are subject to change therefore we are currently not able to reasonably estimate our contribution figures after 2020 see note 12 employee benefit plans of the notes to consolidated and combined financial statements in item 8 herein for further information 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

in the normal course of business with customers vendors and others we have entered into offbalance sheet arrangements such as surety bonds for performance letters of credit and other bank issued guarantees which totaled approximately 39 billion at december 31 2019  it is not practicable to estimate the fair value of these financial instruments none of the offbalance sheet arrangements either has or is likely to have a material effect on our consolidated and combined financial statements 

as of december 31 2019  we had no material offbalance sheet financing arrangements other than those discussed above as such we are not materially exposed to any financing liquidity market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in such financing arrangements 

other factors affecting liquidity 

registration statements  in november 2018 baker hughes filed a universal shelf registration statement on form s3asr automatic shelf registration with the sec to have the ability to sell various types of securities including debt securities class a common stock preferred stock guarantees of debt securities purchase contracts and units the specific terms of any securities to be sold would be described in supplemental filings with the sec the registration statement will expire in 2021 

in december 2017 bhge llc and baker hughes coobligor inc filed a shelf registration statement on form s3 with the sec to have the ability to sell up to 3 billion in debt securities in amounts to be determined at the time of an offering any such offering if it does occur may happen in one or more transactions the specific terms of any debt securities to be sold would be described in supplemental filings with the sec the registration statement will expire in december 2020 

customer receivables  in line with industry practice we may bill our customers for services provided in arrears dependent upon contractual terms in a challenging economic environment we may experience delays in the payment of our invoices due to customers lower cash flow from operations or their more limited access to credit markets while historically there have not been material nonpayment events we attempt to mitigate this risk through working with our customers to restructure their debts a customers failure or delay in payment could have a material adverse effect on our shortterm liquidity and results from operations as of december 31 2019  19 of our gross trade receivables were from customers in the united states other than the united states no other country or single customer accounted for more than 10 of our gross trade receivables at this date as of december 31 2018  24 of our gross trade receivables were from customers in the united states 

international operations  our cash that is held outside the us is 88 of the total cash balance as of december 31 2019  we may not be able to use this cash quickly and efficiently due to exchange or cash controls that could make it challenging as a result our cash balance may not represent our ability to quickly and efficiently use this cash

critical accounting estimates 

accounting estimates and assumptions discussed in this section are those considered to be the most critical to an understanding of our financial statements because they involve significant judgments and uncertainties many of these estimates include determining fair value these estimates reflect our best judgment about current and for some estimates future economic and market conditions and their potential effects based on information available as of the date of these financial statements if these conditions change from those expected it is reasonably possible that the judgments and estimates described below could change which may result in future impairments of goodwill intangibles and longlived assets increases in reserves for contingencies establishment of valuation allowances on deferred tax assets and increased tax liabilities among other effects also see note 1 summary of significant accounting policies of the notes to consolidated and combined financial statements in item 8 herein which discusses our most significant accounting policies 

we have defined a critical accounting estimate as one that is both important to the portrayal of either our financial condition or results of operations and requires us to make difficult subjective or complex judgments or estimates about matters that are uncertain the audit committee of our board of directors has reviewed our critical accounting estimates and the disclosure presented below during the past three fiscal years we have not made any material changes in the methodology used to establish the critical accounting estimates and we believe that the following are the critical accounting estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated and combined financial statements there are other items within our consolidated and combined financial statements that require estimation and judgment but they are not deemed critical as defined above 

revenue recognition on longterm product services agreements 

we have longterm service agreements with our customers predominately within our tps segment these agreements typically require us to maintain assets sold to the customer over a defined contract term these agreements have average contract terms of 15 years from time to time these contract terms may be extended through contract modifications or amendments which may result in revisions to future billing and cost estimates 

revenue recognition on longterm product services agreements requires estimates of both customer payments and the costs to perform required maintenance services over the contract term we recognize revenue on an overtime basis using input method to measure our progress toward completion at the estimated margin rate of the contract 

to develop our billings estimates we consider the number of billable events that will occur based on estimated utilization of the asset under contract over the life of the contract term this estimated utilization will consider both historical and market conditions asset retirements and new product introductions if applicable 

to develop our cost estimates we consider the timing and extent of maintenance and overhaul events including the amount and cost of labor spare parts and other resources required to perform the services in developing our cost estimates we utilize a combination of our historical cost experience and expected cost improvements cost improvements are only included in future cost estimates after savings have been observed in actual results or proven effective through an extensive regulatory or engineering approval process 

we routinely review the estimates used in our product services agreements and regularly revise them to adjust for changes these revisions are based on objectively verifiable information that is available at the time of the review 

the difference between the timing of our revenue recognition and cash received from our customers results in either a contract asset revenue in excess of billings or a contract liability billings in excess of revenue see note 8 contract and other deferred assets and note 9 progress collections and deferred income of the notes to consolidated and combined financial statements in item 8 herein for further information 

we regularly assess customer credit risk inherent in the carrying amounts of receivables and contract assets and estimated earnings including the risk that contractual penalties may not be sufficient to offset our accumulated investment in the event of customer termination we gain insight into expected future utilization and cost trends as well as credit risk through our knowledge of the equipment installed and the close interaction with our customers

through supplying critical services and parts over extended periods revisions to cost or billing estimates may affect a product services agreement’s total estimated profitability resulting in an adjustment of earnings such adjustments generated earnings of 1 million  26 million and 44 million for the three years ended december 31 2019  2018 and 2017  respectively we provide for probable losses when they become evident 

on december 31 2019 our longterm product service agreements net of related billings in excess of revenues of 03 billion represent approximately 29 of our total estimated life of contract billings of 103 billion cash billings collected on these contracts were approximately 06 billion during the years ended december 31 2019 and 2018 our contracts on average are approximately 17 complete based on costs incurred to date and our estimate of future costs revisions to our estimates of future revenue or costs that increase or decrease total estimated contract profitability by 1 would increase or decrease the longterm product service agreements balance by 004 billion 

goodwill and other identified intangible assets 

we test goodwill for impairment annually using data as of july 1 of that year the impairment test consists of two different steps in step one the carrying value of the reporting unit is compared with its fair value in step two which is applied only when the carrying value is more than its fair value the amount of goodwill impairment if any is derived by deducting the fair value of the reporting unit’s assets and liabilities from the fair value of its equity and comparing that amount with the carrying amount of goodwill we determine fair values of each of the reporting units using the market approach when available and appropriate or the income approach or a combination of both we assess the valuation methodology based upon the relevance and availability of the data at the time the valuation is performed 

pension assumptions 

pension benefits are calculated using significant inputs to the actuarial models that measure pension benefit obligations and related effects on operations two assumptions discount rate and expected return on assets are important elements of plan expense and assetliability measurement we evaluate these critical assumptions at least annually on a plan and country specific basis we periodically evaluate other assumptions involving demographic factors such as retirement age mortality and turnover and update them to reflect its experience and expectations for the future actual results in any given year will often differ from actuarial assumptions because of economic and other factors 

projected benefit obligations are measured as the present value of expected payments discounted using the weighted average of market observed yields for high quality fixed income securities with maturities that correspond to the payment of benefits lower discount rates increase present values and subsequent year pension expense and higher discount rates decrease present values and subsequent year pension expense the discount rates used to determine the benefit obligations for our principal pension plans at december 31 2019 and 2018 were 234 and 343  respectively reflecting market interest rates our expected return on assets at december 31 2019 and 2018 was 548 and 594  respectively 

income taxes 

we operate in more than 120 countries and our effective tax rate is based on our income statutory tax rates and differences between tax laws and the gaap in these various jurisdictions tax laws are complex and subject to different interpretations by the taxpayer and respective governmental taxing authorities our income tax rate is significantly affected by the tax rate on our global operations in addition to local country tax laws and regulations this rate depends on the extent earnings are indefinitely reinvested outside the us historically us taxes were due upon repatriation of foreign earnings due to the enactment of us tax reform repatriations of foreign earnings will generally be free of us federal tax but may incur other taxes such as withholding or state taxes indefinite reinvestment is determined by management’s judgment about and intentions concerning the future operations of the company most of these earnings have been reinvested in active nonus business operations however as a result of us tax reform substantially all of our 2017 and prior unrepatriated foreign earnings were subject to us tax and accordingly we expect to have the ability to repatriate those earnings without incremental us federal tax as of december 31 2019 the cumulative amount of indefinitely reinvested foreign earnings is approximately 67

billion  computation of the potential deferred tax liability associated with these undistributed earnings and any other basis differences is not practicable 

deferred income tax assets represent amounts available to reduce income taxes payable in future years we evaluate the recoverability of these future tax deductions and credits by assessing the adequacy of future taxable income from all sources including reversal of taxable temporary differences forecasted operating earnings and available tax planning strategies these sources of income rely heavily on estimates we use our historical experience and short and long range business forecasts to provide insight we record a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 

on december 22 2017 the us enacted the tax cuts and jobs act us tax reform that lowers the statutory tax rate on us earnings taxes historic foreign earnings previously deferred from us taxation at a reduced rate of tax transition tax establishes a territorial tax system and enacts new taxes associated with global operations 

the impact of us tax reform was initially recorded on a provisional basis as the legislation provided for additional guidance to be issued by the us department of the treasury on several provisions including the computation of the transition tax based on guidance received to date finalization of purchase accounting for the bhi acquisition and finalization of our 2017 us income tax returns we have recorded a 107 million tax benefit in 2018 for the impact of tax reform primarily related to the revaluation of deferred taxes 

additionally as part of us tax reform the us has enacted a tax on base eroding payments from the us and a minimum tax on foreign earnings global intangible lowtaxed income we have made an accounting policy election to account for these taxes as period costs 

our tax filings routinely are subject to audit by the tax authorities in the jurisdictions where we conduct business these audits may result in assessments of additional taxes that are resolved with the tax authorities or through the courts we have provided for the amounts we believe will ultimately result from these proceedings but settlements of issues raised in these audits may affect our tax rate we have 451 million of gross unrecognized tax benefits excluding interest and penalties at december 31 2019 we are not able to reasonably estimate in which future periods these amounts ultimately will be settled 

other loss contingencies 

other loss contingencies are uncertain and unresolved matters that arise in the ordinary course of business and result from events or actions by others that have the potential to result in a future loss such contingencies include but are not limited to environmental obligations litigation regulatory proceedings product quality and losses resulting from other events and developments 

the preparation of our consolidated and combined financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenue and expenses and related disclosures as well as disclosures about any contingent assets and liabilities we base these estimates and judgments on historical experience and other assumptions and information that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances estimates and assumptions about future events and their effects are subject to uncertainty and accordingly these estimates may change as new events occur as more experience is acquired as additional information is obtained and as the business environment in which we operate changes

allowance for doubtful accounts 

the determination of the collectability of amounts due from our customers requires us to make judgments and estimates regarding our customers ability to pay amounts due us in order to determine the amount of valuation allowances required for doubtful accounts we monitor our customers payment history and current credit worthiness to determine that collectability is reasonably assured we also consider the overall business climate in which our customers operate provisions for doubtful accounts are recorded based on the aging status of the customer accounts or when it becomes evident that the customer will not make the required payments at either contractual due dates or in the future at december 31 2019 and 2018  the allowance for doubtful accounts totaled 323 million and 327 million of total gross accounts receivable respectively we believe that our allowance for doubtful accounts is adequate to cover potential bad debt losses under current conditions however uncertainties regarding changes in the financial condition of our customers either adverse or positive could impact the amount and timing of any additional provisions for doubtful accounts that may be required 

inventory reserves 

inventory is a significant component of current assets and is stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value this requires us to record provisions and maintain reserves for excess slow moving and obsolete inventory to determine these reserve amounts we regularly review inventory quantities on hand and compare them to estimates of future product demand market conditions production requirements and technological developments these estimates and forecasts inherently include uncertainties and require us to make judgments regarding potential future outcomes at december 31 2019 and 2018  inventory reserves totaled 429 million and 430 million of gross inventory respectively we believe that our reserves are adequate to properly value potential excess slow moving and obsolete inventory under current conditions significant or unanticipated changes to our estimates and forecasts could impact the amount and timing of any additional provisions for excess slow moving or obsolete inventory that may be required 

acquisitionspurchase price allocation 

we allocate the purchase price of an acquired business to its identifiable assets and liabilities based on estimated fair values the excess of the purchase price over the amount allocated to the assets and liabilities if any is recorded as goodwill we use all available information to estimate fair values including quoted market prices the carrying value of acquired assets and widely accepted valuation techniques such as discounted cash flows we engage thirdparty appraisal firms to assist in fair value determination of inventories identifiable intangible assets and any other significant assets or liabilities when appropriate the judgments made in determining the estimated fair value assigned to each class of assets acquired and liabilities assumed as well as asset lives can materially impact our results of operations

brexit 

united kingdom has exited brexit the european union eu on january 31 2020 as per the terms of the exit the uk has ceased to be an eu member but will continue to follow its rules and contribute to its budget for an 11 month transition period ending december 31 2020 the purpose of the transition period is to give time for the uk and eu to negotiate their future relationship including a trade deal there remains significant uncertainty on the outcome of the negotiations and the terms of a future trade deal if any 

although our customer base is global with predominant exposure to the us dollar we have a manufacturing and service base in the uk with some euro procurement thus we are exposed to fluctuations in value of the british pound versus the us dollar euro and other currencies we have a hedging program which looks to accommodate this potential volatility

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we are exposed to certain market risks that are inherent in our financial instruments and arise from changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates we may enter into derivative financial instrument transactions to manage or reduce market risk but do not enter into derivative financial instrument transactions for speculative purposes a discussion of our primary market risk exposure in financial instruments is presented below 

baker hughes company 2019 form 10k  43 

interest rate risk 

all of our longterm debt is comprised of fixed rate instruments we are subject to interest rate risk on our debt and investment portfolio we may use interest rate swaps to manage the economic effect of fixed rate obligations associated with certain debt there were no outstanding interest rate swap agreements as of december 31 2019  the following table sets forth our fixed rate longterm debt excluding finance leases and the related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates 



 foreign currency exchange risk 

we conduct our operations around the world in a number of different currencies and we are exposed to market risks resulting from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates many of our significant foreign subsidiaries have designated the local currency as their functional currency as such future earnings are subject to change due to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates when transactions are denominated in currencies other than our functional currencies 

additionally we buy manufacture and sell components and products across global markets these activities expose us to changes in foreign currency exchange rates commodity prices and interest rates which can adversely affect revenue earned and costs of our operating businesses when the currency in which equipment is sold differs from the primary currency of the legal entity and the exchange rate fluctuates it will affect the revenue earned on the sale these sales and purchase transactions also create receivables and payables denominated in foreign currencies and exposure to foreign currency gains and losses based on changes in exchange rates changes in the price of raw materials used in manufacturing can affect the cost of manufacturing we use derivatives to mitigate or eliminate these exposures where appropriate 

we use cash flow hedging primarily to reduce or eliminate the effects of foreign currency exchange rate changes on purchase and sale contracts accordingly most derivative activity in this category consists of currency exchange contracts we had outstanding foreign currency forward contracts with net notional amounts aggregating 18 billion and 28 billion to hedge exposure to currency fluctuations in various foreign currencies at december 31 2019 and 2018  respectively as of december 31 2019  the company estimates that a 1 appreciation or depreciation in the us dollar would result in an impact of less than 5 million to our pretax earnings however the company is generally able to mitigate its foreign exchange exposure where there are liquid financial markets through use of foreign currency derivative transactions also see note 17 financial instruments of the notes to consolidated and combined financial statements in item 8 herein which has additional details on our strategy

 item 1 business 

baker hughes a ge company the company bhge we us or our a delaware corporation was formed on october 28 2016 for the purpose of facilitating the combination of baker hughes incorporated a delaware corporation baker hughes or bhi and the oil and gas business ge og of general electric company ge 

on july 3 2017 we closed our business combination the transactions to combine ge og and baker hughes creating a fullstream oilfield technology provider that has a unique mix of integrated equipment and service capabilities as a result of the transactions substantially all of the business of ge og and of baker hughes was transferred to a subsidiary of the company baker hughes a ge company llc bhge llc with ge having an economic interest of approximately 625 and the company having an economic interest of approximately 375 of bhge llc the transactions were treated as a “reverse acquisition” for accounting purposes and as such the historical financial statements of the accounting acquirer ge og are the historical financial statements of the company the historical financial results in the combined financial statements presented may not be indicative of the results that would have been achieved had ge og operated as a separate standalone entity during those periods 

 as of december 31 2018  ge held approximately 504  of the economic interest and the company held approximately 496  of the economic interest in bhge llc although we hold a minority economic interest in bhge llc we conduct and exercise full control over all its activities without the approval of any other member accordingly we consolidate the financial results of bhge llc and report a noncontrolling interest in our consolidated and combined financial statements for the economic interest in bhge llc not held by us we are a holding company and have no material assets other than our ownership interest in bhge llc and certain intercompany and tax related balances bhge llc is a securities and exchange commission sec registrant with separate filing requirements with the sec and its separate financial information can be obtained from wwwsecgov 

in june 2018 ge announced their intention to pursue an orderly separation from bhge over time on november 13 2018 we entered into a master agreement and a series of related ancillary agreements and binding term sheets with ge collectively the master agreement framework designed to further solidify the commercial and technological collaborations between us and ge and to facilitate our ability to transition from operating as a controlled company in particular the master agreement framework contemplates longterm agreements between us and ge on technology fulfillment and other key areas to provide greater clarity to customers employees and shareholders for a discussion of certain risks associated with the separation including risks related to our business financial condition and results of operations see “item 1a risk factorsrisks factors related to the transactions and separation from ge” for further details on the master agreement framework see note 18 related party disclosures of the notes to consolidated and combined financial statements in item 8 herein 

secondary offering and llc units repurchase 

in november 2018 we also completed an underwritten secondary public offering in which ge and its affiliates together the selling stockholders sold 1012 million shares of our class a common stock we did not receive any proceeds from the shares sold by the selling stockholders in this offering the offering included the exchange by the selling stockholders of common units of bhge llc units together with the corresponding shares of our class b common stock for our class a common stock which resulted in increases in capital in excess of par value with offsetting reductions in noncontrolling interests and other comprehensive income 

also in november 2018 we repurchased 65 million bhge llc units together with the corresponding shares of our class b common stock from ge and its affiliates for 15 billion or 2248 per unit which is the same per share price net of discounts and commissions paid by the underwriters to the selling stockholders in the offering the repurchase in connection with the repurchase the corresponding shares of class b common stock held by ge and its affiliates were canceled as a result of the secondary offering and the repurchase ges economic interest in bhge llc was reduced from approximately 625 to approximately 504 if ges economic interest in bhge llc falls below 50 they would not have a controlling interest any future declines in their ownership would be accounted for by us as equity transactions reducing their noncontrolling interests

contracts 

we conduct our business under various types of contracts in the upstream midstream and downstream segments including fixedfee or turnkey contracts transactional agreements for products and services and longterm aftermarket service agreements 

we enjoy stable relationships with many of our customers based on longterm project contracts and master service agreements several of those contracts require us to commit to a fixed price based on the customer’s technical specifications with little or no legal relief available due to changes in circumstances such as changes in local laws or industry or geopolitical events in some cases failure to deliver products or perform services within contractual commitments may lead to liquidated damages claims we seek to mitigate these exposures through close collaboration with our customers 

we strive to negotiate the terms of our customer contracts consistent with what we consider to be industry best practices our customers typically indemnify us for certain claims arising from the injury or death of their employees and often their other contractors the loss of or damage to their equipment and often that of their other contractors pollution originating from their equipment or facility and all liabilities related to the well and subsurface operations including loss or damage to the well or reservoir loss of well control fire explosion or any uncontrolled flow of oil or gas conversely we typically indemnify our customers for certain claims arising from the injury or death of our employees and sometimes that of our subcontractors the loss of or damage to our equipment other than equipment lost in the hole and pollution originating from our equipment above the surface of the earth while in our care custody and control where the above indemnities do not apply or are not consistent with industry best practices we typically provide a capped indemnity for damages caused to the customer by our negligence or the negligence of our contractors and include an overall limitation of liability clause it is also our general practice to include a limitation of liability for consequential loss including loss of profits and loss of revenue in all customer contracts 

bhge 2018 form 10k    6 

our indemnity structure may not protect us in every case certain us states such as texas louisiana wyoming and new mexico have enacted oil and natural gas specific antiindemnity statutes these statutes can void the allocation of liability agreed to in a contract however both the texas and louisiana antiindemnity statutes include important exclusions the louisiana statute does not apply to property damage and the texas statute allows mutual indemnity agreements that are supported by insurance and has exclusions which include among other things loss or liability for property damage that results from pollution and the cost of well control events state law laws or public policy in countries outside the us or the negotiated terms of a customer contract may also limit indemnity obligations in the event of the gross negligence or willful misconduct we sometimes contract with customers that are not the end user of our products it is our practice to seek to obtain an indemnity from our customer for any enduser claims but this is not always possible similarly government agencies and other third parties including in some cases other contractors of our customers may make claims in respect of which we are not indemnified and for which responsibility is assessed proportionate to fault in all cases deviations from our standard contracting practices are examined through an established risk deviation process 

the company maintains a commercial general liability insurance policy program that covers against certain operating hazards including product liability claims and personal injury claims as well as certain limited environmental pollution claims for damage to a third party or its property arising out of contact with pollution for which the company is liable however clean up and well control costs are not covered by such program all of the insurance policies purchased by the company are subject to deductible andor selfinsured retention amounts for which we are responsible for payment specific terms conditions limitations and exclusions there can be no assurance that the nature and amount of company insurance will be sufficient to fully indemnify us against liabilities related to our business 

research and development 

we engage in research and development activities directed primarily toward the development of new products services technology and other solutions as well as the improvement of existing products and services and the design of specialized products to meet specific customer needs we continue to invest across all operating segments in products to develop capability improve performance and reduce costs in ofs we invested in a range of formation evaluation capabilities as well as drilling completions and production hardware this included the introduction of electrical submersible pumps esp’s with permanent magnet motors for higher efficiency through reduced power consumption in ofe the recent focus has been to expand capability into deeper water longer offsets and at higher pressures as well as modular designs that allow for simpler and more integrated subsea systems additionally subsea power and processing is also an area in which we are investing covering both pumping and compression in tps we continue to invest in continuous product improvement of reciprocating and centrifugal compressors using advanced fluid dynamic simulation and advanced aeromechanics to improve capability operability and efficiency of its centrifugal compressors family further we continue to invest in our latest generation of gas turbines for energy efficiency and reduced carbon footprint ds continues to invest in advanced digital solutions designed to improve the efficiency reliability and safety of oil and gas production operations these systems integrate operational data and provide analytics from producing oil and gas facilities helping to prevent unplanned downtime and improve facility reliability in addition ds invests in a broad range of measurement and control solutions spanning multiple industries including methane detection systems for oil and gas operations and inspection technology for consumer electronics 

intellectual property 

our technology brands and other intellectual property ip rights are important elements of our business we rely on patent trademark copyright and trade secret laws as well as nondisclosure and employee invention assignment agreements to protect our intellectual property rights many patents and patent applications comprise the bhge portfolio and are owned by us other patents and patent applications applicable to our products and services are licensed to us by ge and in some cases third parties we do not consider any individual patent to be material to our business operations 

in connection with the master agreement framework ge has now entered into an amended and restated ip crosslicense agreement the ip crosslicense agreement with bhge llc ge has agreed to perpetually license to bhge llc the right to use certain intellectual property owned or controlled by ge pursuant to the terms of the ip crosslicense agreement bhge llc has in return also agreed to perpetually license to ge the right to use certain intellectual property rights pursuant to the terms of the ip crosslicense agreement this 

bhge 2018 form 10k    7 

license allows bhge llc to have continued and permanent rights to commercially utilize some ge intellectual property pursuant to the terms of the ip crosslicense agreement 

we follow a policy of seeking patent and trademark protection in numerous countries and regions throughout the world for products and methods that appear to have commercial significance we believe that protection of our patents trademarks and related intellectual property rights is central to the conduct of our business and aggressively pursue protection of our intellectual property rights against infringement worldwide as we deem appropriate to protect our business additionally we consider the quality and timely delivery of our products the service we provide to our customers and the technical knowledge and skills of our personnel to be other important components of the portfolio of capabilities and assets supporting our ability to compete 

seasonality 

our operations can be affected by seasonal weather which can temporarily affect the delivery and performance of our products and services and our customers budgetary cycles examples of seasonal events that can impact our business are set forth below 

 raw materials 

we purchase various raw materials and component parts for use in manufacturing our products and delivering our services the principal raw materials we use include steel alloys chromium nickel titanium barite beryllium copper lead tungsten carbide synthetic and natural diamonds gels sand and other proppants printed circuit boards and other electronic components and hydrocarbonbased chemical feed stocks raw materials that are essential to our business are normally readily available from multiple sources but may be subject to price volatility market conditions can trigger constraints in the supply of certain raw materials and we are always seeking ways to ensure the availability and manage the cost of raw materials our procurement department uses its size and buying power to enhance its access to key materials at competitive prices 

in addition to raw materials and component parts we also use the products and services of metal fabricators machine shops foundries forge shops assembly operations contract manufacturers logistics providers packagers indirect material providers and others in order to produce and deliver products to customers these materials and services are generally available from multiple sources 

bhge 2018 form 10k    8 

employees 

as of december 31 2018  we had approximately 66000  employees of which the majority are outside the us approximately 11 of these employees are represented under collective bargaining agreements or similartype labor arrangements 

environmental matters 

we are committed to the health and safety of people protection of the environment and compliance with environmental laws regulations and our policies our past and present operations include activities that are subject to extensive domestic including us federal state and local and international regulations with regard to air land and water quality and other environmental matters regulations continue to evolve and changes in standards of enforcement of existing regulations as well as the enactment of new legislation may require us and our customers to modify supplement or replace equipment or facilities or to change or discontinue present methods of operation our environmental compliance expenditures and our capital costs for environmental control equipment may change accordingly 

we are and may in the future be involved in voluntary remediation projects at current and former properties on rare occasions our remediation activities are conducted as specified by a government agencyissued consent decree or agreed order remediation costs at these properties are accrued using currently available facts existing environmental permits technology and presently enacted laws and regulations for sites where we are primarily responsible for the remediation our cost estimates are developed based on internal evaluations and are not discounted we record accruals when it is probable that we will be obligated to pay amounts for environmental site evaluation remediation or related activities and such amounts can be reasonably estimated accruals are recorded even if significant uncertainties exist over the ultimate cost of the remediation ongoing environmental compliance costs such as obtaining environmental permits installation and maintenance of pollution control equipment and waste disposal are expensed as incurred 

the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act known as superfund imposes liability for the release of a hazardous substance into the environment superfund liability is imposed without regard to fault even if the waste disposal was in compliance with laws and regulations we have been identified as a potentially responsible party prp at various superfund sites and we accrue our share of the estimated remediation costs for the site prps in superfund actions have joint and several liability and may be required to pay more than their proportional share of such costs 

in some cases it is not possible to quantify our ultimate exposure because the projects are either in the investigative or early remediation stage or superfund allocation information is not yet available based upon current information we believe that our overall compliance with environmental regulations including remediation obligations environmental compliance costs and capital expenditures for environmental control equipment will not have a material adverse effect on our capital expenditures earnings or competitive position because we have either established adequate reserves or our compliance cost based on available information is not expected to be material to our consolidated and combined financial statements our total accrual for environmental remediation was 84 million  and 82 million  at december 31 2018  and 2017  respectively we continue to focus on reducing future environmental liabilities by maintaining appropriate company standards and by improving our assurance programs

 item 1a risk factors 

an investment in our common stock involves various risks when considering an investment in the company one should carefully consider all of the risk factors described below as well as other information included and incorporated by reference in this annual report there may be additional risks uncertainties and matters not listed below that we are unaware of or that we currently consider immaterial any of these may adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows and thus the value of an investment in the company 

risk factors related to our business 

we operate in a highly competitive environment which may adversely affect our ability to succeed 

we operate in a highly competitive environment for marketing oilfield products and services and securing equipment and trained personnel our ability to continually provide competitive products and services can impact our ability to defend maintain or increase prices for our products and services maintain market share and negotiate acceptable contract terms with our customers in order to be competitive we must provide new 

bhge 2018 form 10k    11 

technologies reliable products and services that perform as expected and that create value for our customers and successfully recruit train and retain competent personnel 

in addition our investments in new technologies and properties plants and equipment may not provide competitive returns our ability to defend maintain or increase prices for our products and services is in part dependent on the industry’s capacity relative to customer demand and on our ability to differentiate the value delivered by our products and services from our competitors’ products and services managing development of competitive technology and new product introductions on a forecasted schedule and at a forecasted cost can impact our financial results if we are unable to continue to develop and produce competitive technology or deliver it to our clients in a timely and costcompetitive manner in various markets in which we operate or if competing technology accelerates the obsolescence of any of our products or services any competitive advantage that we may hold and in turn our business financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 

the high cost or unavailability of infrastructure materials equipment supplies and personnel particularly in periods of rapid growth could adversely affect our ability to execute our operations on a timely basis 

our manufacturing operations are dependent on having sufficient raw materials component parts and manufacturing capacity available to meet our manufacturing plans at a reasonable cost while minimizing inventories our ability to effectively manage our manufacturing operations and meet these goals can have an impact on our business including our ability to meet our manufacturing plans and revenue goals control costs and avoid shortages or oversupply of raw materials and component parts raw materials and components of particular concern include steel alloys including chromium and nickel titanium barite beryllium copper lead tungsten carbide synthetic and natural diamonds gels sand and other proppants printed circuit boards and other electronic components and hydrocarbonbased chemical feed stocks our ability to repair or replace equipment damaged or lost in the well can also impact our ability to service our customers a lack of manufacturing capacity could result in increased backlog which may limit our ability to respond to orders with short lead times 

people are a key resource to developing manufacturing and delivering our products and services to our customers around the world our ability to manage the recruiting training retention and efficient usage of the highly skilled workforce required by our plans and to manage the associated costs could impact our business a welltrained motivated workforce has a positive impact on our ability to attract and retain business periods of rapid growth present a challenge to us and our industry to recruit train and retain our employees while also managing the impact of wage inflation and the limited available qualified labor in the markets where we operate 

likewise if the economy or markets decline or other changes occur we may have to reduce utilization of our assets or adjust our workforce to control costs which may cause us to lose some of our skilled employees laborrelated actions including strikes slowdowns and facility occupations can also have a negative impact on our business 

our business could be impacted by geopolitical and terrorism threats in countries where we or our customers do business and our business operations may be impacted by civil unrest government expropriations andor epidemic outbreaks 

geopolitical and terrorism risks continue to grow in a number of key countries where we currently or may in the future do business geopolitical and terrorism risks could lead to among other things a loss of our investment in the country impairment of the safety of our employees and impairment of our or our customers’ ability to conduct operations 

in addition to other geopolitical and terrorism risks civil unrest continues to grow in a number of key countries where we do business our ability to conduct business operations may be impacted by that civil unrest and our assets in these countries may also be subject to expropriation by governments or other parties involved in civil unrest epidemic outbreaks may also impact our business operations by among other things restricting travel to protect the health and welfare of our employees and decisions by our customers to curtail or stop operations in impacted areas 

bhge 2018 form 10k    12 

compliance with and changes in laws could be costly and could affect operating results in addition government disruptions could negatively impact our ability to conduct our business 

we have operations in the united states and in more than 120 countries that can be impacted by expected and unexpected changes in the legal and business environments in which we operate compliancerelated issues could also limit our ability to do business in certain countries and impact our earnings changes that could impact the legal environment include new legislation new regulations new policies investigations and legal proceedings and new interpretations of existing legal rules and regulations in particular changes in export control laws or exchange control laws additional restrictions on doing business in countries subject to sanctions and changes in laws in countries where we operate in addition changes and uncertainty in the political environments in which our businesses operate can have a material effect on the laws rules and regulations that affect our operations government disruptions may also delay or halt the granting and renewal of permits licenses and other items required by us and our customers to conduct our business the continued success of our global business and operations depends in part on our ability to continue to anticipate and effectively manage these and other political legal and regulatory risks 

increased cybersecurity requirements vulnerabilities threats and more sophisticated and targeted computer crime could pose risks to our systems networks products solutions services and data 

increased global cybersecurity vulnerabilities threats and more sophisticated and targeted cyberrelated attacks pose risks to our systems networks products solutions services and data cybersecurity attacks also pose risks to our customers’ partners’ suppliers’ and thirdparty service providers’ products systems and networks and the confidentiality availability and integrity of our and our customers’ data while we attempt to mitigate these risks we remain vulnerable to additional known or unknown threats given our global footprint the large number of customers with which we do business and the increasing sophistication of cyber attacks a cyber attack could occur and persist for an extended period of time without detection we expect that any investigation of a cyber attack would be inherently unpredictable and that it would take time before the completion of any investigation and before there is availability of full and reliable information during such time we would not necessarily know the extent of the harm or how best to remediate it and certain errors or actions could be repeated or compounded before they are discovered and remediated all or any of which would further increase the costs and consequences of a cyber attack 

we also may have access to sensitive confidential or personal data or information in certain of our businesses that is subject to privacy and security laws regulations and customerimposed controls despite our efforts to protect sensitive confidential or personal data or information we may be vulnerable to material security breaches theft misplaced or lost data programming errors employee errors andor malfeasance that could potentially lead to the compromising of sensitive confidential or personal data or information improper use of our systems software solutions or networks unauthorized access use disclosure modification or destruction of information defective products production downtimes and operational disruptions in addition a cyberrelated attack could adversely impact our operating results and result in other negative consequences including damage to our reputation or competitiveness remediation or increased protection costs litigation or regulatory action fines and penalties 

our failure to comply with the foreign corrupt practices act fcpa and other similar laws could have a negative impact on our ongoing operations 

our ability to comply with the fcpa the uk bribery act and various other antibribery and anticorruption laws depends on the success of our ongoing compliance program including our ability to successfully manage our agents distributors and other business partners and supervise train and retain competent employees our compliance program depends on the efforts of our employees agents distributors and other business partners to comply with applicable law and our internal policies we could be subject to sanctions and civil and criminal prosecution as well as fines and penalties in the event of a finding of a violation of any of these laws by us or any of our employees 

antimoney laundering and antiterrorism financing laws could have significant adverse consequences for us 

we maintain an enterprisewide program designed to enable us to comply with all applicable antimoney laundering and antiterrorism financing laws and regulations including the bank secrecy act and the patriot act this program includes policies procedures processes and other internal controls designed to identify monitor manage and mitigate the risk of money laundering or terrorist financing posed by our products services customers 

bhge 2018 form 10k    13 

and geographic locale these controls establish procedures and processes to detect and report suspicious transactions perform customer due diligence respond to requests from law enforcement and meet all recordkeeping and reporting requirements related to particular transactions involving currency or monetary instruments we cannot be sure our programs and controls are or will remain effective to ensure our compliance with all applicable antimoney laundering and antiterrorism financing laws and regulations and our failure to comply could subject us to significant sanctions fines penalties and reputational harm all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

changes in tax laws tax rates tariffs adverse positions taken by taxing authorities and tax audits could impact operating results 

changes in tax laws tax rates tariffs changes in interpretation of tax laws the resolution of tax assessments or audits by various tax authorities and the ability to fully utilize tax loss carryforwards and tax credits could impact our operating results including additional valuation allowances for deferred tax assets in addition we may periodically restructure our legal entity organization if taxing authorities were to disagree with our tax positions in connection with any such restructurings our effective tax rate could be materially impacted 

our operations involve a variety of operating hazards and risks that could cause losses 

the products that we manufacture and the services that we provide are complex and the failure of our equipment to operate properly or to meet specifications may greatly increase our customers’ costs in addition many of these products are used in inherently hazardous industries such as the offshore oilfield business these hazards include blowouts explosions nuclearrelated events fires collisions capsizings and severe weather conditions we may incur substantial liabilities or losses as a result of these hazards while we maintain insurance protection against some of these risks and seek to obtain indemnity agreements from our customers requiring the customers to hold us harmless from some of these risks our insurance and contractual indemnity protection may not be sufficient or effective to protect us under all circumstances or against all risks the occurrence of a significant event against which we were not fully insured or indemnified or the failure of a customer to meet its indemnification obligations to us could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

compliance with and rulings and litigation in connection with environmental and climate change regulations and the environmental and climate change impacts of our or our customers’ operations may adversely affect our business and operating results 

we and our business are impacted by material changes in environmental laws regulations rulings and litigation our expectations regarding our compliance with environmental laws and regulations and our expenditures to comply with environmental laws and regulations including without limitation our capital expenditures for environmental control equipment are only our forecasts regarding these matters these forecasts may be substantially different from actual results which may be affected by factors such as changes in law that impose restrictions on air emissions wastewater management waste disposal hydraulic fracturing or wetland and land use practices more stringent enforcement of existing environmental laws and regulations a change in our share of any remediation costs or other unexpected adverse outcomes with respect to sites where we have been named as a potentially responsible party including without limitation superfund sites the discovery of other sites where additional expenditures may be required to comply with environmental legal obligations and the accidental discharge of hazardous materials 

international national and state governments and agencies continue to evaluate and promulgate legislation and regulations that are focused on restricting emissions commonly referred to as greenhouse gas ghg emissions in the united states the us environmental protection agency epa has taken steps to regulate ghg emissions as air pollutants under the us clean air act of 1970 as amended the epa’s greenhouse gas reporting rule requires monitoring and reporting of ghg emissions from among others certain mobile and stationary ghg emission sources in the oil and natural gas industry which in turn may include data from certain of our wellsite equipment and operations in addition the us government has proposed rules in the past setting ghg emission standards for or otherwise aimed at reducing ghg emissions from the oil and natural gas industry caps or fees on carbon emissions including in the united states have been and may continue to be established and the cost of such caps or fees could disproportionately affect the fossilfuel energy sector we are unable to predict whether and when the proposed changes in laws or regulations ultimately will occur or what they ultimately 

bhge 2018 form 10k    14 

will require and accordingly we are unable to assess the potential financial or operational impact they may have on our business 

other developments focused on restricting ghg emissions include the united nations framework convention on climate change which includes the paris agreement and the kyoto protocol the european union emission trading system article 8 of the european union energy efficiency directive and the united kingdom’s carbon reduction commitment energy efficiency and energy savings opportunity esos schemes and in the united states the regional greenhouse gas initiative the western climate action initiative and various state programs implementing the california global warming solutions act of 2006 known as assembly bill 32 

the potential for climate related changes may pose future risks to our operations and those of our customers these changes can include extreme variability in weather patterns such as increased frequency of severe weather rising mean temperature and sea levels and longterm changes in precipitation patterns such changes have the potential to affect business continuity and operating results particularly at facilities in coastal areas 

uninsured claims and litigation against us could adversely impact our operating results 

we could be impacted by the outcome of pending litigation as well as unexpected litigation or proceedings while we have insurance coverage against operating hazards including product liability claims and personal injury claims related to our products to the extent deemed prudent by our management and to the extent insurance is available no assurance can be given that the nature and amount of that insurance will be sufficient to fully indemnify us against liabilities arising out of pending and future claims and litigation this insurance has deductibles or selfinsured retentions and contains certain coverage exclusions the insurance does not cover damages from breach of contract by us or based on alleged fraud or deceptive trade practices in addition the following risks apply with respect to our insurance coverage 

 control of oil and natural gas reserves by stateowned oil companies may impact the demand for our services and products and create additional risks in our operations 

much of the world’s oil and natural gas reserves are controlled by stateowned oil companies stateowned oil companies may require their contractors to meet local content requirements or other local standards such as conducting our operations through joint ventures with local partners that could be difficult or undesirable for us to meet the failure to meet the local content requirements and other local standards may adversely impact our operations in those countries in addition our ability to work with stateowned oil companies is subject to our ability to negotiate and agree upon acceptable contract terms 

providing services on an integrated or turnkey basis could require us to assume additional risks 

we may enter into integrated contracts or turnkey contracts with our customers and we may choose to provide services outside our core business providing services on an integrated or turnkey basis may subject us to additional risks such as costs associated with unexpected delays or difficulties in drilling or completion operations and risks associated with subcontracting arrangements 

some of our customers require bids in the form of fixed pricing contracts 

some of our customers require bids for contracts in the form of fixed pricing contracts that may require us to provide integrated project management services outside our normal discrete business and to act as project managers as well as service providers and may require us to assume additional risks associated with cost overruns these customers may provide us with inaccurate information in relation to their reserves the estimation of reserves is a process that involves subjective judgment about likely location and volume and estimates that prove 

bhge 2018 form 10k    15 

inaccurate may result in cost overruns delays and project losses for us or our customers which may adversely impact our business and our relationship with our customers 

the credit risks of having a concentrated customer base in the energy industry could result in losses 

having a concentration of customers in the energy industry may impact our overall exposure to credit risk as our customers may be similarly affected by prolonged changes in economic and industry conditions some of our customers may experience extreme financial distress as a result of falling commodity prices and may be forced to seek protection under applicable bankruptcy laws which may affect our ability to recover any amounts due from such customers furthermore countries that rely heavily upon income from hydrocarbon exports have been and may in the future be negatively and significantly affected by a drop in oil prices which could affect our ability to collect from our customers in these countries particularly national oil companies laws in some jurisdictions in which we will operate could make collection difficult or time consuming we will perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and do not expect to require collateral in support of our trade receivables while we maintain reserves for potential credit losses we cannot assure such reserves will be sufficient to meet writeoffs of uncollectible receivables or that our losses from such receivables will be consistent with our expectations additionally in the event of a bankruptcy of any of our customers we may be treated as an unsecured creditor and may collect substantially less or none of the amounts owed to us by such customer 

our remaining performance obligations rpo are subject to modification termination or reduction of orders which could negatively impact our sales 

our rpo is comprised of unfilled customer orders for products and product services expected life of contract sales for product services our rpo can be significantly affected by the timing of orders for large projects although modifications and terminations of orders may be partially offset by cancellation fees customers can and sometimes do terminate or modify orders our failure to replace canceled orders could negatively impact our sales and results of operations the total dollar amount of the company’s rpo as of december 31 2018  was 210 billion  

we may not be able to satisfy technical requirements testing requirements or other specifications required under our service contracts and equipment purchase agreements 

our products are used in deepwater and other harsh environments and severe service applications our contracts with customers and customer requests for bids typically set forth detailed specifications or technical requirements for our products and services which may also include extensive testing requirements we anticipate that such testing requirements will become more common in our contracts in addition recent scrutiny of the offshore drilling industry has resulted in more stringent technical specifications for our products and more comprehensive testing requirements for our products to ensure compliance with such specifications we cannot provide assurance that our products will be able to satisfy the specifications or that we will be able to perform the fullscale testing necessary to prove that the product specifications are satisfied in future contract bids or under existing contracts or that the costs of modifications to our products to satisfy the specifications and testing will not adversely affect our results of operations if our products are unable to satisfy such requirements or we are unable to perform any required fullscale testing our customers may cancel their contracts andor seek new suppliers and our business results of operations cash flows or financial position may be adversely affected 

currency fluctuations or devaluations may impact our operating results 

fluctuations or devaluations in foreign currencies relative to the us dollar can impact our revenue and our costs of doing business as well as the costs of doing business of our customers most of our products and services are sold through contracts denominated in us dollars or local currency indexed to us dollars however some of our revenue local expenses and manufacturing costs are incurred in local currencies and therefore changes in the exchange rates between the us dollar and foreign currencies can increase or decrease our revenue and expenses reported in us dollars or revenue and expenses of our customers and consequently may impact the ability of our customers to satisfy their payment obligations and our results of operations 

bhge 2018 form 10k    16 

changes in economic andor market conditions may impact our ability to borrow andor cost of borrowing 

the condition of the capital markets and equity markets in general can affect the price of our common stock and our ability to obtain financing if necessary if our credit rating is ever downgraded it could increase borrowing costs under credit facilities and commercial paper programs as well as increase the cost of renewing or obtaining or make it more difficult to renew obtain or issue new debt financing 

an inability to protect our intellectual property rights could adversely affect our business 

there can be no assurance that the steps we take to obtain maintain and protect our intellectual property rights will be completely adequate our intellectual property rights may fail to provide us with significant competitive advantages particularly in foreign jurisdictions where we have not invested in an intellectual property portfolio or that do not have or do not enforce strong intellectual property rights the weakening of protection of our trademarks patents and other intellectual property rights could also adversely affect our business 

we are a party to a number of licenses that give us rights to intellectual property that is necessary or useful to our business including from ge following the transactions our success depends in part on the ability of our licensors to obtain maintain and sufficiently enforce the licensed intellectual property rights we have commercialized without protection for the intellectual property rights we license other companies might be able to offer substantially identical products for sale which could adversely affect our competitive business position and harm our business products also there can be no assurances that we will be able to obtain or renew from third parties the licenses to use intellectual property rights we need in the future and there is no assurance that such licenses can be obtained on reasonable terms specifically we are a party to several agreements with ge which provide for intellectual property rights to use and access access and use of intellectual property created solely or collaboratively with ge is an important part of our operations we would be adversely affected in the event these agreements were terminated without the right to continue such access as we might continue to improve current products and services or develop new ones 

we may be subject to litigation if another party claims that we have infringed upon its intellectual property rights 

the tools techniques methodologies programs and components we use to provide our products and services may infringe upon the intellectual property rights of others or be challenged on that basis regardless of the merits infringement claims may result in significant legal and other costs and may distract management from running our core business resolving such claims could increase our costs including through royalty payments to acquire licenses if available from third parties and through the development of noninfringing technologies if a license to resolve a claim were not available we might not be able to continue providing a particular service or product which could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

the effects of brexit may have a negative impact on our financial results and operations of the business 

in june 2016 united kingdom uk voters approved the uk’s exit brexit from the european union eu the political and economic uncertainty surrounding brexit if it occurs or in whatever form it occurs could harm our business and financial results due to fluctuations in the value of the british pound versus the us dollar euro and other currencies in addition brexit could result in delayed deliveries which may impact our internal supply chain and our customer projects 

risk factors related to the worldwide oil and natural gas industry 

volatility of oil and natural gas prices can adversely affect demand for our products and services 

prices of oil and gas products are set on a commodity basis as a result the volatility in oil and natural gas prices can impact our customers’ activity levels and spending for our products and services current energy prices are important contributors to cash flow for our customers and their ability to fund exploration and development activities expectations about future prices and price volatility are important for determining future spending levels 

lower oil and natural gas prices generally lead to decreased spending by our customers while higher oil and natural gas prices generally lead to increased spending by our customers sustained high energy prices can be an impediment to economic growth and can therefore negatively impact spending by our customers our customers also take into account the volatility of energy prices and other risk factors by requiring higher returns for individual

projects if there is higher perceived risk any of these factors could affect the demand for oil and natural gas and could have a material effect on our results of operations 

demand for oil and natural gas is subject to factors beyond our control which may adversely affect our operating results changes in the global economy could impact our customers’ spending levels and our revenue and operating results 

demand for oil and natural gas as well as the demand for our services and products is highly correlated with global economic growth and in particular by the economic growth of countries such as the us india china and developing countries in asia and the middle east which are either significant users of oil and natural gas or whose economies are experiencing the most rapid economic growth compared to the global average weakness or deterioration of the global economy or credit markets could reduce our customers’ spending levels and reduce our revenue and operating results incremental weakness in global economic activity particularly in china india europe the middle east and developing countries in asia could reduce demand for oil and natural gas and result in lower oil and natural gas prices incremental strength in global economic activity in such areas will create more demand for oil and natural gas and support higher oil and natural gas prices a prolonged reduction in oil and natural gas prices may require us to record additional asset impairments such a potential impairment charge could have a material adverse impact on our operating results   

requirements and voluntary initiatives to reduce greenhouse gas emissions as well as increased climate change awareness are likely to result in increased costs for the oil and gas industry to curb greenhouse gas emissions and could have an adverse impact on demand for oil and natural gas 

international national and state governments agencies and bodies continue to evaluate and promulgate regulations and voluntary initiatives that are focused on restricting ghg emissions these requirements and initiatives are likely to become more stringent over time and to result in increased costs for the oil and gas industry to curb ghg emissions in addition these developments and public perception relating to climate change may curtail production and demand for hydrocarbons such as oil and natural gas by shifting demand towards and investment in relatively lower carbon energy sources such as wind solar and other renewables the renewable energy industry is developing enhanced technologies and becoming more competitive with fossilfuel energy if renewable energy becomes more competitive than fossilfuel energy particularly during periods of higher oil and natural gas prices it could have a material effect on our results of operations 

supply of oil and natural gas is subject to factors beyond our control which may adversely affect our operating results 

productive capacity for oil and natural gas is dependent on our customers’ decisions to develop and produce oil and natural gas reserves and on the regulatory environment in which our customers and we operate the ability to produce oil and natural gas can be affected by the number and productivity of new wells drilled and completed as well as the rate of production and resulting depletion of existing wells advanced technologies such as horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing improve total recovery but also result in a more rapid production decline and may become subject to more stringent regulation particularly on the state or local level in the future 

productive capacity in excess of demand spare productive capacity is also an important factor influencing energy prices and spending by oil and natural gas exploration companies spare productive capacity and oil and natural gas storage inventory levels are an indicator of the relative balance between supply and demand high or increasing storage inventories or spare productive capacity generally indicate that supply is exceeding demand and that energy prices are likely to soften low or decreasing storage inventories or spare productive capacity are generally an indicator that demand is growing faster than supply and that energy prices are likely to rise 

access to prospects is also important to our customers but such access may be limited because host governments do not allow access to the reserves government regulations and the costs incurred by oil and natural gas exploration companies to conform to and comply with government regulations may also limit the quantity of oil and natural gas that may be economically produced 

supply can also be impacted by the degree to which individual opec nations and other large oil and natural gas producing countries are willing and able to control production and exports of oil to decrease or increase supply and to support their targeted oil price while meeting their market share objectives any of these factors could affect the supply of oil and natural gas and could have a material effect on our results of operations 

bhge 2018 form 10k    18 

our customers’ activity levels and spending for our products and services and ability to pay amounts owed us could be impacted by the reduction of their cash flow and the ability of our customers to access equity or credit markets 

our customers’ access to capital is dependent on their ability to access the funds necessary to develop economically attractive projects based upon their expectations of future energy prices required investments and resulting returns limited access to external sources of funding has caused and may continue to cause customers to reduce their capital spending plans to levels supported by internally generated cash flow in addition a reduction of cash flow resulting from declines in commodity prices a reduction in borrowing bases under reservebased credit facilities or the lack of available debt or equity financing may impact the ability of our customers to pay amounts owed to us and could cause us to increase our reserve for doubtful accounts 

seasonal and weather conditions could adversely affect demand for our services and operations 

variation from normal weather patterns such as cooler or warmer summers and winters can have a significant impact on demand for our services and operations adverse weather conditions such as hurricanes in the gulf of mexico may interrupt or curtail our operations or our customers’ operations cause supply disruptions and result in a loss of revenue and damage to our equipment and facilities which may or may not be insured for example extreme winter conditions in canada russia or the north sea may interrupt or curtail our operations or our customers’ operations in those areas and result in a loss of revenue 

risk factors related to the transactions and separation from ge 

we may experience challenges relating to the ongoing integration of baker hughes and ge og or the separation from ge that may result in a decline in the anticipated benefits of the transactions and the master agreement framework 

the transactions involved the combination of two businesses that previously operated as independent businesses the company has been and will continue to be required to devote management attention and resources to integrating its business practices and operations as well as to the separation from ge 

if we experience difficulties with the ongoing integration process or with the separation from ge the anticipated benefits of the transactions and the master agreement framework may not be realized fully or at all may take longer to realize than expected or may be offset by the decrease in business from certain customers or other negative impacts these integration matters and the impact of the separation from ge could have an adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition or other prospects on an ongoing basis 

we have incurred and will continue to incur costs in connection with the transactions and the integration of the two businesses we also have incurred and expect to continue to incur additional costs in connection with the master agreement framework and the separation from ge 

the transactions involved the combination of two businesses that previously operated as independent businesses as a result of the transactions there are many systems that must be successfully integrated between the two businesses including information management purchasing accounting and finance sales billing payroll and benefits fixed asset and lease administration systems and regulatory compliance 

separately on november 13 2018 the company bhge llc and ge entered into the master agreement framework designed to further solidify the commercial and technological relationships between the two companies and to facilitate bhge’s ability to transition from operating as a controlled company in particular the master agreement framework contemplates longterm agreements between the company bhge llc and ge on technology fulfillment and other key areas to provide greater clarity to customers employees and shareholders certain of the transactions contemplated by the master agreement framework may be subject to regulatory approvals the company has been and will continue to be required to devote management attention and resources to integrating its business practices and operations as well as to the separation from ge 

our entry into the master agreement framework with ge the ongoing integration of baker hughes and ge og the separation from ge and any necessary changes to complete integration efforts based on the new business arrangements contemplated by the master agreement framework may result in additional costs and difficulties actual costs related to the separation and the implementation of the changes contemplated by the 

bhge 2018 form 10k    19 

master agreement framework may be higher than anticipated and we may experience additional difficulties in effecting such changes 

we are a “controlled company” within the meaning of the nyse rules and as a result qualify for and are relying on exemptions from certain corporate governance requirements as a result our stockholders do not have the same protections afforded to stockholders of companies that are subject to such requirements the interests of ge as a majority stockholder may differ from the interests of other stockholders of the company if we do not retain “controlled company” status in the event that ge sells additional equity in the future we may during the phasein period continue to rely on exemptions from certain corporate governance requirements that provide protection to stockholders of other companies 

through its ownership of a majority of our voting power and the provisions set forth in our charter our bylaws and the stockholders agreement ge has the ability to designate and elect a majority of our directors until the later of july 3 2019 and the first date on which it ceases to hold more than 50 of the voting power of our outstanding common stock the trigger date as a result of ge’s ownership of a majority of the voting power of our common stock we are a “controlled company” as defined in nyse listing rules and therefore are not subject to nyse requirements that would otherwise require us to have i a majority of independent directors ii a nominating committee composed solely of independent directors iii the compensation of our executive officers determined by a majority of the independent directors or a compensation committee composed solely of independent directors and iv director nominees selected or recommended for the board’s selection either by a majority of the independent directors or a nominating committee composed solely of independent directors in connection with the master agreement framework the stockholders agreement was amended and restated to provide that following the trigger date and until ge and its affiliates own less than 20 of the voting power of our outstanding common stock ge shall be entitled to designate one person for nomination to our board of directors see “note 18 related party transactions of the notes to consolidated and combined financial statements in item 8 herein” 

in the event that ge sells additional equity in the future ge may cease to control a majority of our voting power accordingly we may no longer be a “controlled company” as defined in nyse listing rules under the listing rules a company that ceases to be a controlled company must comply with the independent board committee requirements as they relate to the nominating and corporate governance and compensation committees on the following phasein schedule 1 one independent committee member at the time it ceases to be a controlled company 2 a majority of independent committee members within 90 days of the date it ceases to be a controlled company and 3 all independent committee members within one year of the date it ceases to be a controlled company additionally nyse listing rules provide a 12month phasein period from the date a company ceases to be a controlled company to comply with the majority independent board requirement although we believe we would be able to modify the composition of our board in a timely manner during these phasein periods our stockholders may not have the same protections afforded to stockholders of companies of which the majority of directors are independent furthermore a change in our board of directors and committee membership may result in a change in corporate strategy and operation philosophies and may result in deviations from our current strategy 

the company is a party to the tax matters agreement with ge the tax matters agreement entered into at closing of the transactions and amended under the master agreement framework under the tax matters agreement the company could under certain circumstances be entitled to receive tax benefits in connection with the sale by ge of its equity interests in the company however there is no assurance that the company will realize any such benefits 

ge also has control over certain matters submitted to stockholders for approval including changes in capital structure transactions requiring stockholder approval under delaware law and corporate governance subject to the terms of the stockholders agreement relating to ge’s agreement to vote in favor of director nominees not designated by ge and to proposals by ge to acquire all of the shares of class a common stock held by nonge stockholders even if ge sells additional equity in the future and is no longer a majority stockholder ge may still exercise control or significant influence over matters submitted to our stockholders for approval ge may also have influence over matters that do not require stockholder approval ge may have different interests than other holders of class a common stock on these and other matters which may affect our operational and financial decisions 

among other things ge’s control could delay defer or prevent a sale of the company that other stockholders support or conversely this control could result in the consummation of such a transaction that other stockholders do not support this concentrated control could discourage a potential investor from seeking to acquire class a common stock and as a result might harm the market price of that class a common stock 

bhge 2018 form 10k    20 

given ge’s ownership of the majority of our outstanding voting securities and the interactions that have taken place and will take place between us and ge our success depends in part on the reputation and success of ge in the event that we are no longer controlled by ge our success will remain partially dependent on ge through among other things their participation in our business operations and strategy as described above our reliance on the longterm agreements and transition services agreements between the company and ge pursuant to the master agreement framework and the public perception of our affiliation with ge 

if we were to cease being a majorityowned subsidiary of ge in the future such a separation could adversely affect our business and profitability uncertainty about the likelihood of any such separation could also adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

following the transactions we market many of our products and services using the “ge” brand name and logo although we believe that the association with ge provides many benefits including a strong brand broad research and development capabilities elevated status with suppliers and customers and established relationships with regulators we may in the future determine to rebrand our business or pursue alternative marketing strategies which could adversely affect our ability to attract new customers or maintain existing business relationships with customers suppliers and other business partners all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

although ge has licensed to us the right to use certain “ge” marks in its corporate name and in the products and services of our business in connection with certain oil and gas activities and other discrete oil and gas segments that right to use these marks would be lost if the license were to expire or otherwise terminate which may occur among other reasons in the event we cease being a majorityowned subsidiary of ge subject to certain phaseout provisions as a consequence of such expiration or termination we would need to remove the “ge” marks from our corporate name products and services 

in addition if we were to cease being a majorityowned subsidiary of ge or there were otherwise a meaningful change in the relationships between ge and the company beyond what is contemplated by the master agreement framework such an event or events could adversely affect among other things our ability to attract and retain customers we may be required to provide more favorable pricing and other terms to our customers and take other action to maintain our relationship with existing and attract new customers all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations for example although ge would be subject to certain noncompete restrictions for a period of time following the company no longer being a majorityowned subsidiary of ge in the absence of an agreement regulating the gotomarket strategy and the reciprocal commercial and technical support between ge and the company ge may attempt to compete with us with respect to certain technologies and customer projects where we have adjacent or overlapping presence eg steam turbines and gas turbines furthermore we may lose cost synergies joint investment and rd opportunities and access to customers in fields where we and ge currently collaborate as per the terms of the channel agreement eg additive manufacturing digital 

the potential separation from ge has created and may continue to create uncertainty among our customers suppliers and other business partners in addition the master agreement framework and related binding term sheets contemplate entering into a number of definitive agreements based on terms included therein if we are unable to enter into definitive agreements with ge for any reason by certain specified deadlines the business arrangements contemplated by the master agreement framework may by their terms take effect in the absence of definitive agreements which may lead to additional uncertainty and could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations the potential uncertainty due to these or other factors may undermine our business and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations and may cause increased volatility and wide price fluctuations in our stock price 

the market price of our class a common stock could be materially impacted due to the substantial number of shares of our capital stock eligible for sale in future secondary offerings by ge 

the large number of shares of our class a common stock eligible for sale by ge in the future could cause the market price of our class a common stock to substantially decrease ge owned approximately 504 percent of our outstanding class a common stock as of december 31 2018  assuming full exchange of our shares of class b common stock pursuant to the exchange agreement future sales of a substantial number of shares of our class 

bhge 2018 form 10k    21 

a common stock in the public market or the perception that these sales could occur could substantially decrease the market price of our class a common stock 

the market price and trading volume of our class a common stock may be volatile which could result in rapid and substantial losses for our stockholders 

the market price of our class a common stock may be highly volatile and could be subject to wide fluctuations in addition the trading volume in our class a common stock may fluctuate and cause significant price variations to occur if the market price of our class a common stock declines significantly you may be unable to sell your shares of our class a common stock at or above your purchase price if at all we cannot assure you that the market price of our class a common stock will not fluctuate or decline significantly in the future some of the factors that could negatively affect the price of our class a common stock or result in fluctuations in the price or trading volume of our class a common stock include variations in our quarterly operating results failure to meet our earnings estimates publication of research reports about us or our industry or the failure of securities analysts to cover our class a common stock after the offering additions or departures of our executive officers and other key management personnel adverse market reaction to any indebtedness we may incur or securities we may issue in the future actions by stockholders offerings of our class a common stock by ge or the perceived possibility of such offerings changes in market valuations of similar companies speculation in the press or investment community changes or proposed changes in laws or regulations or differing interpretations thereof affecting our business or enforcement of these laws and regulations or announcements relating to these matters adverse publicity about our industry generally or individual scandals specifically and general market and economic conditions 

antitakeover provisions in our organizational documents and delaware law might discourage or delay acquisition attempts for us that you might consider favorable 

our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws may delay or prevent a merger or acquisition that a stockholder may consider favorable by permitting our board of directors to issue one or more series of preferred stock requiring advance notice for stockholder proposals and nominations and placing limitations on convening stockholder meetings these provisions may also discourage acquisition proposals or delay or prevent a change in control which could harm our stock price

managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations mda should be read in conjunction with the consolidated   and combined financial statements included in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data contained herein 

executive summary 

on july 3 2017 we closed the transactions to combine ge og and baker hughes creating a fullstream oilfield technology provider that has a unique mix of integrated oilfield products services and digital solutions the transactions were executed using a partnership structure pursuant to which ge og and baker hughes each contributed their operating assets to a newly formed partnership bhge llc as of december 31 2018  ge holds an approximate 504 controlling interest in this partnership and the company holds an approximate 496 economic interest the results of operations for the company include the results of baker hughes from july 3 2017 the date of acquisition through december 31 2018  the majority of the baker hughes business operations are included in the oilfield services segment the transactions were treated as a “reverse acquisition” for accounting purposes and as such the historical financial statements of the accounting acquirer ge og are the historical financial statements of the company the current year results may not be comparable to prior years as the prior years include the results of baker hughes only from july 3 2017 we operate through our four business segments oilfield services ofs oilfield equipment ofe turbomachinery  processing solutions tps and digital solutions ds as of december 31 2018  bhge employs approximately 66000  employees and operates in more than 120 countries 

in june 2018 ge announced their intention to pursue an orderly separation from bhge over time to that end during the fourth quarter of 2018 certain equity transactions were completed and ge’s ownership of bhge was reduced from approximately 625 to approximately 504 at the same time we completed the master agreement framework designed to further solidify the commercial and technological collaboration between us and ge and to position us for the future the master agreement framework focuses on areas where we work most closely with ge on developing leading technology and executing for customers first we defined the parameters for longterm collaboration and partnership with ge on critical rotating equipment technology second for our digital software and technology business we will maintain the status quo as the exclusive supplier of ge digital oilandgas applications finally we reached agreements on a number of other areas including our controls business pension taxes and intercompany services for further details on the master agreement framework see note 18 related party disclosures of the notes to consolidated and combined financial statements in item 8 herein 

in aggregate we anticipate that the net financial impact of the agreements contemplated by the master agreement framework will have a slightly negative impact on our operating margin rates of approximately 20 to 40 basis points in addition we expect to incur onetime charges related to separation from ge of approximately 02 billion  to 03 billion  over the next three years we expect these charges to be primarily related to the buildout of information technology infrastructure as well as customary transaction fees for a discussion of certain risks associated with separation including risks related to our business financial condition and results of operations see “item 1a risk factorsrisks factors related to the transactions and separation from ge” 

in 2018  we generated revenue of 22877 million  compared to 17179 million  in 2017  the increase in revenue was driven primarily by ofs as 2018  included the full year results of baker hughes compared to only six months in 2017  and to a lesser extent by ds partially offset by declines in tps and ofe income before income taxes and equity in loss of affiliate was 680 million  in 2018  and included restructuring and impairment charges of 433 million  and merger and related costs of 153 million  these restructuring and impairment charges were recorded as a result of our continued actions to adjust our operations and cost structure to reflect reduced activity levels in 2017  loss before income taxes and equity in loss of affiliate was 335 million  which also included restructuring and impairment charges of 412 million  and merger and related costs of 373 million

outlook 

our business is exposed to a number of different macro factors which influence our expectations and outlook all of our outlook expectations are purely based on the market as we see it today and are subject to change given volatile conditions in the industry 

 

 

 

 

 we have other segments in our portfolio that are more correlated with different industrial metrics such as our digital solutions business overall we believe our portfolio is uniquely positioned to compete across the value chain and deliver comprehensive solutions for our customers we remain optimistic about the longterm economics of the industry but are continuing to operate with flexibility given our expectations for volatility and changing assumptions in the near term 

solar and wind net additions continued to exceed coal and gas throughout 2018  governments may change or may not continue incentives for renewable energy additions in the long term renewables cost decline may accelerate to compete with newbuilt fossil capacity however we do not anticipate any significant impacts to our business in the foreseeable future 

despite the nearterm volatility the longterm outlook for our industry remains positive we believe the world’s demand for energy will continue to rise and the supply of energy will continue to increase in complexity requiring greater service intensity and more advanced technology from oilfield service companies as such we remain focused on delivering innovative costefficient solutions that deliver step changes in operating and economic performance for our customers

business environment 

the following discussion and analysis summarizes the significant factors affecting our results of operations financial condition and liquidity position as of and for the year ended december 31 2018  2017  and 2016  and should be read in conjunction with the consolidated and combined financial statements and related notes of the company 

we operate in more than 120  countries helping customers find evaluate drill produce transport and process hydrocarbon resources our revenue is predominately generated from the sale of products and services to major national and independent oil and natural gas companies worldwide and is dependent on spending by our customers for oil and natural gas exploration field development and production this spending is driven by a number of factors including our customers forecasts of future energy demand and supply their access to resources to develop and produce oil and natural gas their ability to fund their capital programs the impact of new government regulations and most importantly their expectations for oil and natural gas prices as a key driver of their cash flows 

oil and natural gas prices 

oil and natural gas prices are summarized in the table below as averages of the daily closing prices during each of the periods indicated 



 2018 demonstrated the volatility of the oil and gas market through the first three quarters of 2018 we experienced stability in the north american and international markets however in the fourth quarter of 2018 commodity prices dropped nearly 40 resulting in increased customer uncertainty from an offshore standpoint through most of 2018 we saw multiple large offshore projects reach positive final investment decisions and the lng market and outlook improved throughout 2018 driven by increased demand globally in 2018 the first large north american lng positive final investment decision was reached 

outside of north america customer spending is highly driven by brent oil prices which increased on average throughout the year average brent oil prices increased to 7134bbl in 2018 from 5412bbl in 2017 and ranged from a low of 5057bbl in december 2018 to a high of 8607bbl in october 2018 for the first three quarters of 2018 brent oil prices increased sequentially however in the fourth quarter brent oil prices declined 39 versus the end of the third quarter as a result of increased supply from the us worries of a global economic slowdown and lower than expected production cuts 

in north america customer spending is highly driven by wti oil prices which similar to brent oil prices on average increased throughout the year average wti oil prices increased to 6523bbl in 2018 from 5080bbl in 2017 and ranged from a low of 4448bbl in december 2018 to a high of 7741bbl in june 2018 

in north america natural gas prices as measured by the henry hub natural gas spot price averaged 315mmbtu in 2018 representing a 6 increase over the prior year throughout the year henry hub natural gas spot prices ranged from a high of 624mmbtu in january 2018 to a low of 249mmbtu in february 2018 according to the us department of energy doe working natural gas in storage at the end of 2018 was 2705 billion cubic feet bcf which was 156 or 421 bcf below the corresponding week in 2017

baker hughes rig count 

the baker hughes rig counts are an important business barometer for the drilling industry and its suppliers when drilling rigs are active they consume products and services produced by the oil service industry rig count trends are driven by the exploration and development spending by oil and natural gas companies which in turn is influenced by current and future price expectations for oil and natural gas the counts may reflect the relative strength and stability of energy prices and overall market activity however these counts should not be solely relied on as other specific and pervasive conditions may exist that affect overall energy prices and market activity 

we have been providing rig counts to the public since 1944 we gather all relevant data through our field service personnel who obtain the necessary data from routine visits to the various rigs customers contractors and other outside sources as necessary we base the classification of a well as either oil or natural gas primarily upon filings made by operators in the relevant jurisdiction this data is then compiled and distributed to various wire services and trade associations and is published on our website we believe the counting process and resulting data is reliable however it is subject to our ability to obtain accurate and timely information rig counts are compiled weekly for the us and canada and monthly for all international rigs published international rig counts do not include rigs drilling in certain locations such as russia the caspian region and onshore china because this information is not readily available 

rigs in the us and canada are counted as active if on the day the count is taken the well being drilled has been started but drilling has not been completed and the well is anticipated to be of sufficient depth to be a potential consumer of our drill bits in international areas rigs are counted on a weekly basis and deemed active if drilling activities occurred during the majority of the week the weekly results are then averaged for the month and published accordingly the rig count does not include rigs that are in transit from one location to another rigging up being used in nondrilling activities including production testing completion and workover and are not expected to be significant consumers of drill bits 

the rig counts are summarized in the table below as averages for each of the periods indicated 



2018  compared to 2017 

overall the rig count was 2211 in 2018 an increase of 9 as compared to 2017 due primarily to north american activity the rig count in north america increased 13 in 2018 compared to 2017 internationally the rig count increased 4 in 2018 as compared to the same period last year 

within north america the increase was primarily driven by the us rig count which was up 18 on average versus 2017 partially offset with a decrease in the canadian rig count which was down 8 on average internationally the improvement in the rig count was driven primarily by increases in the africa region of 18 the asiapacific region and latin america region were also up by 9 and 3 respectively partially offset by the europe region which was down 8 

2017  compared to 2016 

overall the rig count was 2030  in 2017  an increase of 27 as compared to 2016  due primarily to north american activity the rig count in north america increased 69 in 2017  compared to 2016  internationally the rig count decreased 1 in 2017  as compared to the same period last year 

within north america the increase was primarily driven by the land rig count which was up 72 partially offset by a decrease in the offshore rig count of 16 internationally the rig count decrease was driven primarily by decreases in latin america of 7 the europe region and africa region which were down by 4 and 2 respectively partially offset by the asiapacific region which was up 8

the discussions below relating to significant line items from our consolidated and combined statements of income loss are based on available information and represent our analysis of significant changes or events that impact the comparability of reported amounts where appropriate we have identified specific events and changes that affect comparability or trends and where reasonably practicable have quantified the impact of such items in addition the discussions below for revenue and cost of revenue are on a total basis as the business drivers for product sales and services are similar all dollar amounts in tabulations in this section are in millions of dollars unless otherwise stated certain columns and rows may not add due to the use of rounded numbers 

the results of operations for the company include the results of baker hughes from july 3 2017 the date of acquisition through the year ended december 31 2018  our results of operations are evaluated by the chief executive officer on a consolidated basis as well as at the segment level 

the performance of our operating segments is evaluated based on segment operating income loss which is defined as income loss before income taxes and equity in loss of affiliate and before the following net interest expense net other non operating income corporate expenses restructuring impairment and other charges inventory impairment merger and related costs and certain gains and losses not allocated to the operating segments 

in evaluating the segment performance the company uses the following 

volume   volume is the increase or decrease in products andor services sold periodoverperiod excluding the impact of foreign exchange and price the volume impact on profit is calculated by multiplying the prior period profit rate by the change in revenue volume between the current and prior period it also includes price defined as the change in sales price for a comparable product or service periodoverperiod and is calculated as the periodoverperiod change in sales prices of comparable products and services 

foreign exchange fx    fx measures the translational foreign exchange impact or the translation impact of the periodoverperiod change on sales and costs directly attributable to change in the foreign exchange rate compared to the us dollar fx impact is calculated by multiplying the functional currency amounts revenue or profit with the periodoverperiod fx rate variance using the average exchange rate for the respective period 

inflationdeflation   inflationdeflation is defined as the increase or decrease in direct and indirect costs of the same type for an equal amount of volume it is calculated as the yearoveryear change in cost ie price paid of direct material compensation  benefits and overhead costs 

productivity  productivity is measured by the remaining variance in profit after adjusting for the periodoverperiod impact of volume  price foreign exchange and inflationdeflation as defined above improved or lower periodoverperiod cost productivity is the result of cost efficiencies or inefficiencies such as cost decreasing or increasing more than volume or cost increasing or decreasing less than volume or changes in sales mix among segments this also includes the periodoverperiod variance of transactional foreign exchange aside from those foreign currency devaluations that are reported separately for business evaluation purposes 

orders and remaining performance obligations 

orders  we recognized orders of 23904 million  17159 million  and 11066 million  in 2018  2017  and 2016  respectively in 2018 service orders were up 36 and equipment orders were up 45 compared to 2017  in 2017  service orders were up 39 and equipment orders were up 88 compared to 2016  the increase in orders in 2018 and 2017 was driven primarily by the acquisition of baker hughes 

remaining performance obligations rpo as of december 31 2018  and 2017 the aggregate amount of the transaction price allocated to the unsatisfied or partially unsatisfied performance obligations was 210 billion in each year respectively

oilfield services 

ofs 2018  revenue was 11617 million  an increase of 5736 million  from 2017  primarily as a result of having the full year of baker hughes revenue in 2018 in addition to the incremental revenue from baker hughes the improvement in revenue was also due to increased activity in the north american and international markets compared to the prior year as evidenced by the 9 increase in the worldwide rig counts 

ofs 2018  segment operating income was 785 million  compared to 67 million  in 2017  the additional contribution resulting from the acquisition of baker hughes and to a lesser extent higher activity and synergy benefits drove the increase in operating income 

oilfield equipment 

ofe 2018  revenue was 2641 million  a decrease of 20 million  or 1 from 2017  the decrease was driven primarily by lower volume in the flexible pipe business additionally the decrease was driven by lower opening rpo in the subsea production systems business partially offset with higher volume in the surface pressure control and services businesses 

ofe 2018  segment operating income was breakeven compared to 26 million  in 2017  this decline in profitability was primarily driven by a negative mix of longterm projects and to a lesser extent foreign exchange headwinds deflation savings and positive cost productivity only partially offset the decrease 

turbomachinery  process solutions 

tps 2018  revenue was 6015 million  a decrease of 280 million  or 4 from 2017  the decrease was primarily driven by lower volume in the businesses that serve the upstream segments and to a lesser extent by lower volume in the businesses that serve the downstream segments equipment revenue in 2018 represented 40 and service revenue represented 60 of total revenue 

tps 2018  segment operating income was 621 million  compared to 665 million  in 2017  the decline in profitability was driven primarily by lower volume and to a lesser extent by negative cost productivity the decrease was partially offset by a favorable business mix and cost reduction actions implemented by the company 

digital solutions 

ds 2018  revenue was 2604 million  an increase of 262 million  or 11 from 2017  primarily as a result of the incremental baker hughes revenue in 2018 outside of this contribution a decrease in the controls business due to softness in the power endmarket was more than offset by revenue increases across all other product lines 

ds 2018  segment operating income was 390 million  compared to 357 million  in 2017  the increase in profitability was driven by positive cost productivity including synergy benefits 

corporate 

in 2018  corporate expenses were 405 million  an increase of 35 million  compared to 2017  primarily from the additional expenses related to the acquisition of baker hughes partially offset by realized synergies

bhge 2018 form 10k    35 

interest expense net 

in 2018  we incurred net interest expense of 223 million  an increase of 92 million  from the prior year primarily driven by 395 billion of debt issued in the fourth quarter of 2017 and debt obtained in the baker hughes acquisition partially offset by reduced interest expense associated with the retirement of debt of 615 million in january of 2018 in addition interest expense declined as we ceased participation in the ge receivables monetization program 

equity in loss of affiliate 

in 2018 we recorded a loss of 139 million related to our equity method investment in bj services as a result we discontinued applying the equity method we will resume application of the equity method only after our share of unrecognized net income equals our share of net loss not recognized during the period the equity method was suspended there is no cash impact to bhge 

income tax 

in 2018  our income tax expense increased by 213 million  from 45 million  in 2017  to 258 million  in 2018  the increase was primarily due to higher foreign taxes related to increased foreign earnings and geographical mix of earnings

oilfield equipment 

ofe 2017  revenue was 2661 million  a decrease of 879 million  or 25 from 2016  the revenue decline was primarily due to continued volume pressures and to a lesser extent to negative pricing driven by the delays in final investment decisions by our customers in prior years 

ofe 2017  segment operating income was 26 million  compared to 305 million  in 2016  this decline in profitability was the result of negative productivity and volume while strong deflation savings more than offset pricing pressures 

turbomachinery  process solutions 

tps 2017  revenue was 6295 million  a decrease of 373 million  or 6 from 2016  the decline was primarily attributable to negative pricing and to a lesser extent to volume decreases driven by lower equipment contracts being awarded in prior years and continued softness in the services market 

bhge 2018 form 10k    36

restructuring impairment and other 

in 2017  we recognized 412 million  in restructuring impairment and other charges a decrease of 104 million  compared to 2016 this decrease was driven by the absence of any significant currency devaluations in angola and nigeria that were experienced in 2016

highlights of our compliance program include the following 



bhge 2018 form 10k    37 



liquidity and capital resources 

our objective in financing our business is to maintain sufficient liquidity adequate financial resources and financial flexibility in order to fund the requirements of our business at december 31 2018  we had cash cash equivalents and restricted cash of 3723 million  compared to 7030 million  at december 31 2017  cash cash equivalents and restricted cash includes 747 million  and 997 million  of cash held on behalf of ge at december 31 2018  and 2017  respectively 

excluding cash held on behalf of ge our us subsidiaries held approximately 07 billion and 36 billion while our foreign subsidiaries held approximately 23 billion and 24 billion of our cash cash equivalents and restricted cash as at december 31 2018 and 2017 respectively a substantial portion of the cash held by foreign subsidiaries at december 31 2018  has been reinvested in active nonus business operations if we decide at a later date to repatriate those funds to the us we may be required to provide taxes on certain of those funds however due to the enactment of us tax reform repatriations of foreign earnings will generally be free of us federal tax but may incur other taxes such as withholding or state taxes 

we have a five year 3 billion  committed unsecured revolving credit facility the 2017 credit agreement with commercial banks maturing in july 2022 the 2017 credit agreement contains certain customary representations and warranties certain affirmative covenants and no negative covenants upon the occurrence of certain events of default our obligations under the 2017 credit agreement may be accelerated such events of default include payment defaults to lenders under the 2017 credit agreement and other customary defaults we were in compliance with all of the credit facilitys covenants and in 2018 there were no borrowings under the credit facility 

we have a commercial paper program under which we may issue from time to time up to 3 billion  in commercial paper with maturities of no more than 397 days at december 31 2018  we had no borrowings 

bhge 2018 form 10k    38 

outstanding under the commercial paper program the maximum combined borrowing at any time under both the 2017 credit agreement and the commercial paper program is 3 billion  

if market conditions were to change and our revenue was reduced significantly or operating costs were to increase our cash flows and liquidity could be reduced additionally it could cause the rating agencies to lower our credit rating there are no ratings triggers that would accelerate the maturity of any borrowings under our committed credit facility however a downgrade in our credit ratings could increase the cost of borrowings under the credit facility and could also limit or preclude our ability to issue commercial paper should this occur we could seek alternative sources of funding including borrowing under the credit facility 

during the year ended december 31 2018  we used cash to fund a variety of activities including certain working capital needs and restructuring costs capital expenditures the repayment of debt payment of dividends distributions to ge and share repurchases we believe that cash on hand cash flows generated from operations and the available credit facility will provide sufficient liquidity to manage our global cash needs 

cash flows 

cash flows provided by used in each type of activity were as follows for the years ended december 31 



operating activities

during 2018 we returned 33 billion of cash to our shareholders through share buybacks dividends to our class a stockholders and distributions to ge specifically as part of our 3 billion share buyback authorization we used cash of 387 million and 638 million respectively to repurchase and cancel our shares of class a and class b common stock and corresponding paired units in bhge llc on a pro rata basis additionally in november 2018 bhge llc repurchased 65 million units from ge for a cash consideration of 1461 million as of december 31 2018 the stock repurchase program has been substantially completed also during 2018 we paid aggregate dividends of 315 million  to our class a stockholders and bhge llc made a distribution of 495 million  to ge

cash requirements 

in 2019  we believe cash on hand cash flows from operating activities the available revolving credit facility and availability under our existing shelf registrations of debt will provide us with sufficient capital resources and liquidity to manage our working capital needs meet contractual obligations fund capital expenditures and dividends and support the development of our shortterm and longterm operating strategies if necessary we may issue commercial paper or other shortterm debt to fund cash needs in the us in excess of the cash generated in the us 

our capital expenditures can be adjusted and managed by us to match market demand and activity levels in light of the current market conditions capital expenditures in 2019  will be made as appropriate at a rate that we 

bhge 2018 form 10k    40 

estimate would equal up to 5 of annual revenue the expenditures are expected to be used primarily for normal recurring items necessary to support our business we also anticipate making income tax payments in the range of 425 million to 475 million in 2019  

contractual obligations 

in the table below we set forth our contractual obligations as of december 31 2018  certain amounts included in this table are based on our estimates and assumptions about these obligations including their duration anticipated actions by third parties and other factors the contractual obligations we will actually pay in future periods may vary from those reflected in the table because the estimates and assumptions are subjective 



 

due to the uncertainty with respect to the timing of potential future cash outflows associated with our uncertain tax positions we are unable to make reasonable estimates of the period of cash settlement if any to the respective taxing authorities therefore 597 million  in uncertain tax positions including interest and penalties have been excluded from the contractual obligations table above see note 12 income taxes of the notes to consolidated and combined financial statements in item 8 herein for further information 

we have certain defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans covering certain of our us and international employees during 2018  we made contributions and paid direct benefits of approximately 72 million  in connection with those plans and we anticipate funding approximately 41 million  during 2019  amounts for pension funding obligations are based on assumptions that are subject to change therefore we are currently not able to reasonably estimate our contribution figures after 2019 see note 11 employee benefit plans of the notes to consolidated and combined financial statements in item 8 herein for further information 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

in the normal course of business with customers vendors and others we have entered into offbalance sheet arrangements such as surety bonds for performance letters of credit and other bank issued guarantees which totaled approximately 36 billion  at december 31 2018  it is not practicable to estimate the fair value of these financial instruments none of the offbalance sheet arrangements either has or is likely to have a material effect on our consolidated and combined financial statements 

bhge 2018 form 10k    41 

as of december 31 2018  we had no material offbalance sheet financing arrangements other than normal operating leases as discussed above as such we are not materially exposed to any financing liquidity market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in such financing arrangements 

other factors affecting liquidity 

registration statements  in november 2018 bhge filed a universal shelf registration statement on form s3asr automatic shelf registration with the sec to have the ability to sell various types of securities including debt securities class a common stock preferred stock guarantees of debt securities purchase contracts and units the specific terms of any securities to be sold would be described in supplemental filings with the sec the registration statement will expire in 2021 

in december 2017 bhge llc and baker hughes coobligor inc filed a shelf registration statement on form s3 with the sec to have the ability to sell up to 3 billion in debt securities in amounts to be determined at the time of an offering any such offering if it does occur may happen in one or more transactions the specific terms of any debt securities to be sold would be described in supplemental filings with the sec the registration statement will expire in 2020 

customer receivables    in line with industry practice we may bill our customers for services provided in arrears dependent upon contractual terms in a challenging economic environment we may experience delays in the payment of our invoices due to customers lower cash flow from operations or their more limited access to credit markets while historically there have not been material nonpayment events we attempt to mitigate this risk through working with our customers to restructure their debts a customers failure or delay in payment could have a material adverse effect on our shortterm liquidity and results from operations as of december 31 2018  24 of our gross trade receivables were from customers in the united states other than the united states no other country or single customer accounted for more than 10 of our gross trade receivables at this date as of december 31 2017  20 of our gross trade receivables were from customers in the united states 

international operations    our cash that is held outside the us is 81 of the total cash balance as of december 31 2018  we may not be able to use this cash quickly and efficiently due to exchange or cash controls that could make it challenging as a result our cash balance may not represent our ability to quickly and efficiently use this cash 

critical accounting estimates 

  accounting estimates and assumptions discussed in this section are those considered to be the most critical to an understanding of our financial statements because they involve significant judgments and uncertainties many of these estimates include determining fair value these estimates reflect our best judgment about current and for some estimates future economic and market conditions and their potential effects based on information available as of the date of these financial statements if these conditions change from those expected it is reasonably possible that the judgments and estimates described below could change which may result in future impairments of goodwill intangibles and longlived assets increases in reserves for contingencies establishment of valuation allowances on deferred tax assets and increased tax liabilities among other effects also see note 1 summary of significant accounting policies of the notes to consolidated and combined financial statements in item 8 herein which discusses our most significant accounting policies 

we have defined a critical accounting estimate as one that is both important to the portrayal of either our financial condition or results of operations and requires us to make difficult subjective or complex judgments or estimates about matters that are uncertain the audit committee of our board of directors has reviewed our critical accounting estimates and the disclosure presented below during the past three fiscal years we have not made any material changes in the methodology used to establish the critical accounting estimates and we believe that the following are the critical accounting estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated and combined financial statements there are other items within our consolidated and combined financial statements that require estimation and judgment but they are not deemed critical as defined above 

bhge 2018 form 10k    42 

revenue recognition on longterm product services agreements 

we have longterm service agreements with our customers predominately within our tps segment these agreements typically require us to maintain assets sold to the customer over a defined contract term these agreements have average contract terms of 15 years from time to time these contract terms may be extended through contract modifications or amendments which may result in revisions to future billing and cost estimates 

revenue recognition on longterm product services agreements requires estimates of both customer payments and the costs to perform required maintenance services over the contract term we recognize revenue on an overtime basis using input method to measure our progress toward completion at the estimated margin rate of the contract 

to develop our billings estimates we consider the number of billable events that will occur based on estimated utilization of the asset under contract over the life of the contract term this estimated utilization will consider both historical and market conditions asset retirements and new product introductions if applicable 

to develop our cost estimates we consider the timing and extent of maintenance and overhaul events including the amount and cost of labor spare parts and other resources required to perform the services in developing our cost estimates we utilize a combination of our historical cost experience and expected cost improvements cost improvements are only included in future cost estimates after savings have been observed in actual results or proven effective through an extensive regulatory or engineering approval process 

we routinely review the estimates used in our product services agreements and regularly revise them to adjust for changes these revisions are based on objectively verifiable information that is available at the time of the review 

the difference between the timing of our revenue recognition and cash received from our customers results in either a contract asset revenue in excess of billings or a contract liability billings in excess of revenue see note 8 contract and other deferred assets and note 9 progress collections and deferred income of the notes to consolidated and combined financial statements in item 8 herein for further information 

we regularly assess customer credit risk inherent in the carrying amounts of receivables and contract assets and estimated earnings including the risk that contractual penalties may not be sufficient to offset our accumulated investment in the event of customer termination we gain insight into expected future utilization and cost trends as well as credit risk through our knowledge of the equipment installed and the close interaction with our customers through supplying critical services and parts over extended periods revisions to cost or billing estimates may affect a product services agreement’s total estimated profitability resulting in an adjustment of earnings such adjustments generated earnings of 26 million  44 million  and 113 million for the three years ended december 31 2018  2017  and 2016  respectively we provide for probable losses when they become evident 

on december 31 2018 our longterm product service agreements net of related billings in excess of revenues of 04 billion represent approximately 43 of our total estimated life of contract billings of 103 billion cash billings collected on these contracts were approximately 06 billion and 05 billion during the years ended december 31 2018 and 2017 respectively our contracts on average are approximately 16 complete based on costs incurred to date and our estimate of future costs revisions to our estimates of future revenue or costs that increase or decrease total estimated contract profitability by 1 would increase or decrease the longterm product service agreements balance by 004 billion 

goodwill and other identified intangible assets 

we test goodwill for impairment annually using data as of july 1 of that year the impairment test consists of two different steps in step one the carrying value of the reporting unit is compared with its fair value in step two which is applied only when the carrying value is more than its fair value the amount of goodwill impairment if any is derived by deducting the fair value of the reporting unit’s assets and liabilities from the fair value of its equity and comparing that amount with the carrying amount of goodwill we determine fair values of each of the reporting units using the market approach when available and appropriate or the income approach or a combination of both we 

bhge 2018 form 10k    43 

assess the valuation methodology based upon the relevance and availability of the data at the time the valuation is performed 

pension assumptions 

pension benefits are calculated using significant inputs to the actuarial models that measure pension benefit obligations and related effects on operations two assumptions discount rate and expected return on assets are important elements of plan expense and assetliability measurement we evaluate these critical assumptions at least annually on a plan and country specific basis we periodically evaluate other assumptions involving demographic factors such as retirement age mortality and turnover and update them to reflect its experience and expectations for the future actual results in any given year will often differ from actuarial assumptions because of economic and other factors 

projected benefit obligations are measured as the present value of expected payments discounted using the weighted average of market observed yields for high quality fixed income securities with maturities that correspond to the payment of benefits lower discount rates increase present values and subsequent year pension expense and higher discount rates decrease present values and subsequent year pension expense the discount rates used to determine the benefit obligations for our principal pension plans at december 31 2018  2017  and 2016  were 343  299  and 341 respectively reflecting market interest rates our expected return on assets at december 31 2018  2017  and 2016  was 594  626  and 686  respectively 

income taxes 

we operate in more than 120 countries and our effective tax rate is based on our income statutory tax rates and differences between tax laws and the gaap in these various jurisdictions tax laws are complex and subject to different interpretations by the taxpayer and respective governmental taxing authorities our income tax rate is significantly affected by the tax rate on our global operations in addition to local country tax laws and regulations this rate depends on the extent earnings are indefinitely reinvested outside the us historically us taxes were due upon repatriation of foreign earnings due to the enactment of us tax reform repatriations of foreign earnings will generally be free of us federal tax but may incur other taxes such as withholding or state taxes indefinite reinvestment is determined by management’s judgment about and intentions concerning the future operations of the company most of these earnings have been reinvested in active nonus business operations however as a result of us tax reform substantially all of our prior unrepatriated foreign earnings were subject to us tax and accordingly we expect to have the ability to repatriate those earnings without incremental us federal tax as a result of us tax reform we changed our intent regarding certain cash repatriations and have accrued an additional 9 million  of foreign withholding taxes as of december 31 2018 the cumulative amount of indefinitely reinvested foreign earnings is approximately 63 billion computation of the potential deferred tax liability associated with these undistributed earnings and any other basis differences is not practicable 

deferred income tax assets represent amounts available to reduce income taxes payable in future years we evaluate the recoverability of these future tax deductions and credits by assessing the adequacy of future taxable income from all sources including reversal of taxable temporary differences forecasted operating earnings and available tax planning strategies these sources of income rely heavily on estimates we use our historical experience and short and long range business forecasts to provide insight we record a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 

on december 22 2017 the us enacted the tax cuts and jobs act us tax reform that lowers the statutory tax rate on us earnings taxes historic foreign earnings previously deferred from us taxation at a reduced rate of tax transition tax establishes a territorial tax system and enacts new taxes associated with global operations 

the impact of us tax reform was initially recorded on a provisional basis as the legislation provided for additional guidance to be issued by the us department of the treasury on several provisions including the computation of the transition tax based on guidance received to date finalization of purchase accounting for the baker hughes acquisition and finalization of our 2017 us income tax returns we have recorded a 107 million tax benefit in 2018 for the impact of tax reform primarily related to the revaluation of deferred taxes 

bhge 2018 form 10k    44 

additionally as part of us tax reform the us has enacted a tax on base eroding payments from the us and a minimum tax on foreign earnings global intangible lowtaxed income we have made an accounting policy election to account for these taxes as period costs 

our tax filings routinely are subject to audit by the tax authorities in the jurisdictions where we conduct business these audits may result in assessments of additional taxes that are resolved with the tax authorities or through the courts we have provided for the amounts we believe will ultimately result from these proceedings but settlements of issues raised in these audits may affect our tax rate we have 472 million of gross unrecognized tax benefits excluding interest and penalties at december 31 2018 we are not able to reasonably estimate in which future periods these amounts ultimately will be settled 

other loss contingencies 

other loss contingencies are uncertain and unresolved matters that arise in the ordinary course of business and result from events or actions by others that have the potential to result in a future loss such contingencies include but are not limited to environmental obligations litigation regulatory proceedings product quality and losses resulting from other events and developments 

the preparation of our consolidated and combined financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenue and expenses and related disclosures as well as disclosures about any contingent assets and liabilities we base these estimates and judgments on historical experience and other assumptions and information that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances estimates and assumptions about future events and their effects are subject to uncertainty and accordingly these estimates may change as new events occur as more experience is acquired as additional information is obtained and as the business environment in which we operate changes 

allowance for doubtful accounts 

the determination of the collectability of amounts due from our customers requires us to make judgments and estimates regarding our customers ability to pay amounts due us in order to determine the amount of valuation allowances required for doubtful accounts we monitor our customers payment history and current credit worthiness to determine that collectability is reasonably assured we also consider the overall business climate in which our customers operate provisions for doubtful accounts are recorded based on the aging status of the customer accounts or when it becomes evident that the customer will not make the required payments at either contractual due dates or in the future at december 31 2018  and 2017  the allowance for doubtful accounts totaled 327 million  and 330 million  of total gross accounts receivable respectively we believe that our allowance for doubtful accounts is adequate to cover potential bad debt losses under current conditions however uncertainties regarding changes in the financial condition of our customers either adverse or positive could impact the amount and timing of any additional provisions for doubtful accounts that may be required 

inventory reserves 

inventory is a significant component of current assets and is stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value this requires us to record provisions and maintain reserves for excess slow moving and obsolete inventory to determine these reserve amounts we regularly review inventory quantities on hand and compare them to estimates of future product demand market conditions production requirements and technological developments these estimates and forecasts inherently include uncertainties and require us to make judgments regarding potential future outcomes at december 31 2018  and 2017  inventory reserves totaled 430 million  and 360 million  of gross inventory respectively we believe that our reserves are adequate to properly value potential excess slow moving and obsolete inventory under current conditions significant or unanticipated changes to our estimates and forecasts could impact the amount and timing of any additional provisions for excess slow moving or obsolete inventory that may be required 

bhge 2018 form 10k    45 

acquisitionspurchase price allocation 

we allocate the purchase price of an acquired business to its identifiable assets and liabilities based on estimated fair values the excess of the purchase price over the amount allocated to the assets and liabilities if any is recorded as goodwill we use all available information to estimate fair values including quoted market prices the carrying value of acquired assets and widely accepted valuation techniques such as discounted cash flows we engage thirdparty appraisal firms to assist in fair value determination of inventories identifiable intangible assets and any other significant assets or liabilities when appropriate the judgments made in determining the estimated fair value assigned to each class of assets acquired and liabilities assumed as well as asset lives can materially impact our results of operations

brexit 

in june 2016 uk voters approved the uk’s exit brexit from the eu the uk is currently negotiating the terms of its exit from the eu scheduled for march 29 2019 there remains significant uncertainty as to whether the withdrawal agreement between the uk government and the eu will be approved when if and on what terms brexit will happen there is a range of outcomes possible from no brexit to an abrupt cutoff of the uk’s future trading relationship with the eu the above withdrawal agreement contemplates a transition period from march 2019 through december 2020 to allow time for a future trade deal to be agreed 

although our customer base is global with predominant exposure to the us dollar we have a manufacturing and service base in the uk with some euro procurement thus we are exposed to fluctuations in value of the british pound versus the us dollar euro and other currencies we have a hedging program which looks to accommodate this potential volatility

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we are exposed to certain market risks that are inherent in our financial instruments and arise from changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates we may enter into derivative financial instrument transactions to manage or reduce market risk but do not enter into derivative financial instrument transactions for speculative purposes a discussion of our primary market risk exposure in financial instruments is presented below 

bhge 2018 form 10k    47 

interest rate risk 

all of our longterm debt is comprised of fixed rate instruments we are subject to interest rate risk on our debt and investment portfolio we may use interest rate swaps to manage the economic effect of fixed rate obligations associated with certain debt there were no outstanding interest rate swap agreements as of december 31 2018  the following table sets forth our fixed rate longterm debt excluding capital leases and the related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates 



 foreign currency exchange risk 

we conduct our operations around the world in a number of different currencies and we are exposed to market risks resulting from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates many of our significant foreign subsidiaries have designated the local currency as their functional currency as such future earnings are subject to change due to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates when transactions are denominated in currencies other than our functional currencies 

additionally we buy manufacture and sell components and products across global markets these activities expose us to changes in foreign currency exchange rates commodity prices and interest rates which can adversely affect revenue earned and costs of our operating businesses when the currency in which equipment is sold differs from the primary currency of the legal entity and the exchange rate fluctuates it will affect the revenue earned on the sale these sales and purchase transactions also create receivables and payables denominated in foreign currencies and exposure to foreign currency gains and losses based on changes in exchange rates changes in the price of raw materials used in manufacturing can affect the cost of manufacturing we use derivatives to mitigate or eliminate these exposures where appropriate 

we use cash flow hedging primarily to reduce or eliminate the effects of foreign currency exchange rate changes on purchase and sale contracts accordingly most derivative activity in this category consists of currency exchange contracts we had outstanding foreign currency forward contracts with net notional amounts aggregating 28 billion  and 33 billion  to hedge exposure to currency fluctuations in various foreign currencies at december 31 2018  and 2017  respectively as of december 31 2018  the company estimates that a 1 appreciation or depreciation in the us dollar would result in an impact of less than 5 million to our pretax earnings however the company is generally able to mitigate its foreign exchange exposure where there are liquid financial markets through use of foreign currency derivative transactions also see note 16 financial instruments of the notes to consolidated and combined financial statements in item 8 herein which has additional details on our strategy

contracts 

we conduct our business under various types of contracts in the upstream midstream and downstream segments including fixedfee or turnkey contracts transactional agreements for products and services and longterm aftermarket service agreements 

we enjoy stable relationships with many of our customers based on longterm project contracts and master service agreements several of those contracts require us to commit to a fixed price based on the customer’s technical specifications with little or no legal relief available due to changes in circumstances such as changes in local laws or industry or geopolitical events in some cases failure to deliver products or perform services within contractual commitments may lead to liquidated damages claims we seek to mitigate these exposures through close collaboration with our customers 

we strive to negotiate the terms of our customer contracts consistent with what we consider to be industry best practices our customers typically indemnify us for certain claims arising from the injury or death of their employees and often their other contractors the loss of or damage to their equipment and often that of their other contractors pollution originating from their equipment or facility and all liabilities related to the well and subsurface operations including loss or damage to the well or reservoir loss of well control fire explosion or any uncontrolled flow of oil or gas conversely we typically indemnify our customers for certain claims arising from the injury or death of our employees and sometimes that of our subcontractors the loss of or damage to our equipment other than equipment lost in the hole and pollution originating from our equipment above the surface of the earth while in our care custody and control where the above indemnities do not apply or are not consistent with industry best practices we typically provide a capped indemnity for damages caused to the customer by our negligence or the negligence of our contractors and include an overall limitation of liability clause it is also our general practice to include a limitation of liability for consequential loss including loss of profits and loss of revenue in all customer contracts 

our indemnity structure may not protect us in every case certain us states such as texas louisiana wyoming and new mexico have enacted oil and natural gas specific antiindemnity statutes these statutes can void the allocation of liability agreed to in a contract however both the texas and louisiana antiindemnity statutes include important exclusions the louisiana statute does not apply to property damage and the texas statute allows mutual indemnity agreements that are supported by insurance and has exclusions which include among other things loss or liability for property damage that results from pollution and the cost of well control events state law laws or public policy in countries outside the us or the negotiated terms of a customer contract may also limit indemnity obligations in the event of the gross negligence or willful misconduct we sometimes contract with customers that are not the end user of our products it is our practice to seek to obtain an indemnity from our customer for any enduser claims but this is not always possible similarly government agencies and other third parties including in some cases other contractors of our customers may make claims in respect of which we are not indemnified and for which responsibility is assessed proportionate to fault in all cases deviations from our standard contracting practices are examined through an established risk deviation process 

the company maintains a commercial general liability insurance policy program that covers against certain operating hazards including product liability claims and personal injury claims as well as certain limited environmental pollution claims for damage to a third party or its property arising out of contact with pollution for which the company is liable however clean up and well control costs are not covered by such program all of the insurance policies purchased by the company are subject to deductible andor selfinsured retention amounts for which we are responsible for payment specific terms conditions limitations and exclusions there can be no

assurance that the nature and amount of company insurance will be sufficient to fully indemnify us against liabilities related to our business 

research and development 

we engage in research and development activities directed primarily toward the development of new products services technology and other solutions as well as the improvement of existing products and services and the design of specialized products to meet specific customer needs for information regarding the total amount of research and development expense in each of the three years in the period ended december 31 2017  see note 1 summary of significant accounting policies of the notes to consolidated and combined financial statements in item 8 herein

intellectual property 

our technology brands and other intellectual property rights are important elements of our business we rely on patent trademark copyright and trade secret laws as well as nondisclosure and employee invention assignment agreements to protect our intellectual property rights many of the patents and patent applications in our portfolio are owned by us while other patents and patent applications in our portfolio are licensed to us by ge and third parties we do not consider any individual patent or trademark to be material to our business operations 

in connection with the transactions ge entered into an ip crosslicense agreement the ip crosslicense agreement with bhge llc ge agreed to perpetually license to bhge llc the right to use certain intellectual property owned or controlled by ge other than ge digital pursuant to the terms of the ip crosslicense agreement bhge llc agreed to perpetually license to ge the right to use certain intellectual property rights pursuant to the terms of the ip crosslicense agreement this license allows bhge llc to have continued rights to use some of ge’s intellectual property so that they can be leveraged pursuant to the terms of the ip crosslicense agreement any improvements to such intellectual property made or developed by bhge llc will be owned by bhge llc and licensed back to ge pursuant to the terms of the ip crosslicense agreement and any improvements to such intellectual property made or developed by ge will be owned by ge and licensed to bhge llc if we were to cease being a majorityowned subsidiary of ge the licenses under the ip crosslicense agreement are intended to survive 

we have followed a policy of seeking patent and trademark protection in numerous countries and regions throughout the world for products and methods that appear to have commercial significance we believe that protection of our patents trademarks and related intellectual property rights is central to the conduct of our business and aggressively pursue protection of our intellectual property rights against infringement worldwide as we deem appropriate to protect our business additionally we consider the quality and timely delivery of our products the service we provide to our customers and the technical knowledge and skills of our personnel to be other important components of the portfolio of capabilities and assets supporting our ability to compete

seasonality 

our operations can be affected by seasonal weather which can temporarily affect the delivery and performance of our products and services and our customers budgetary cycles examples of seasonal events that can impact our business are set forth below 

 raw materials 

we purchase various raw materials and component parts for use in manufacturing our products and delivering our services the principal raw materials we use include steel alloys chromium nickel titanium barite beryllium copper lead tungsten carbide synthetic and natural diamonds gels sand and other proppants printed circuit boards and other electronic components and hydrocarbonbased chemical feed stocks raw materials that are essential to our business are normally readily available from multiple sources but may be subject to price volatility market conditions can trigger constraints in the supply of certain raw materials and we are always seeking ways to ensure the availability and manage the cost of raw materials our procurement department uses its size and buying power to enhance its access to key materials at competitive prices 

in addition to raw materials and component parts we also use the products and services of metal fabricators machine shops foundries forge shops assembly operations contract manufacturers logistics providers packagers indirect material providers and others in order to produce and deliver products to customers these materials and services are generally available from multiple sources 

employees 

as of december 31 2017  we had over 64000  employees of which the majority are outside the us approximately 11 of these employees are represented under collective bargaining agreements or similartype labor arrangements

environmental matters 

we are committed to the health and safety of people protection of the environment and compliance with environmental laws regulations and our policies our past and present operations include activities that are subject to extensive domestic including us federal state and local and international regulations with regard to air land and water quality and other environmental matters regulations continue to evolve and changes in standards of enforcement of existing regulations as well as the enactment of new legislation may require us and our customers to modify supplement or replace equipment or facilities or to change or discontinue present methods of operation our environmental compliance expenditures and our capital costs for environmental control equipment may change accordingly 

we are and may in the future be involved in voluntary remediation projects at current and former properties on rare occasions our remediation activities are conducted as specified by a government agencyissued consent decree or agreed order remediation costs at these properties are accrued using currently available facts existing environmental permits technology and presently enacted laws and regulations for sites where we are primarily responsible for the remediation our cost estimates are developed based on internal evaluations and are not discounted we record accruals when it is probable that we will be obligated to pay amounts for environmental site evaluation remediation or related activities and such amounts can be reasonably estimated accruals are recorded even if significant uncertainties exist over the ultimate cost of the remediation ongoing environmental compliance costs such as obtaining environmental permits installation and maintenance of pollution control equipment and waste disposal are expensed as incurred 

the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act known as superfund imposes liability for the release of a hazardous substance into the environment superfund liability is imposed without regard to fault even if the waste disposal was in compliance with laws and regulations we have been identified as a potentially responsible party prp at various superfund sites and we accrue our share of the estimated remediation costs for the site prps in superfund actions have joint and several liability and may be required to pay more than their proportional share of such costs 

in some cases it is not possible to quantify our ultimate exposure because the projects are either in the investigative or early remediation stage or superfund allocation information is not yet available based upon current information we believe that our overall compliance with environmental regulations including remediation obligations environmental compliance costs and capital expenditures for environmental control equipment will not have a material adverse effect on our capital expenditures earnings or competitive position because we have either established adequate reserves or our compliance cost based on available information is not expected to be material to our consolidated and combined financial statements our total accrual for environmental remediation was 82 million  and 28 million  at december 31 2017  and 2016 respectively we continue to focus on reducing future environmental liabilities by maintaining appropriate company standards and by improving our assurance programs

 item 1a risk factors 

an investment in our common stock involves various risks when considering an investment in the company one should carefully consider all of the risk factors described below as well as other information included and incorporated by reference in this annual report there may be additional risks uncertainties and matters not listed below that we are unaware of or that we currently consider immaterial any of these may adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows and thus the value of an investment in the company 

risk factors related to our business 

we operate in a highly competitive environment which may adversely affect our ability to succeed 

we operate in a highly competitive environment for marketing oilfield products and services and securing equipment and trained personnel our ability to continually provide competitive products and services can impact our ability to defend maintain or increase prices for our products and services maintain market share and negotiate acceptable contract terms with our customers in order to be competitive we must provide new 

bhge 2017 form 10k  11 

technologies reliable products and services that perform as expected and that create value for our customers and successfully recruit train and retain competent personnel 

in addition our investments in new technologies and properties plants and equipment may not provide competitive returns our ability to defend maintain or increase prices for our products and services is in part dependent on the industry’s capacity relative to customer demand and on our ability to differentiate the value delivered by our products and services from our competitors’ products and services managing development of competitive technology and new product introductions on a forecasted schedule and at a forecasted cost can impact our financial results if we are unable to continue to develop and produce competitive technology or deliver it to our clients in a timely and costcompetitive manner in various markets in which we operate or if competing technology accelerates the obsolescence of any of our products or services any competitive advantage that we may hold and in turn our business financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 

the high cost or unavailability of infrastructure materials equipment supplies and personnel particularly in periods of rapid growth could adversely affect our ability to execute our operations on a timely basis 

our manufacturing operations are dependent on having sufficient raw materials component parts and manufacturing capacity available to meet our manufacturing plans at a reasonable cost while minimizing inventories our ability to effectively manage our manufacturing operations and meet these goals can have an impact on our business including our ability to meet our manufacturing plans and revenue goals control costs and avoid shortages or oversupply of raw materials and component parts raw materials and components of particular concern include steel alloys including chromium and nickel titanium barite beryllium copper lead tungsten carbide synthetic and natural diamonds gels sand and other proppants printed circuit boards and other electronic components and hydrocarbonbased chemical feed stocks our ability to repair or replace equipment damaged or lost in the well can also impact our ability to service our customers a lack of manufacturing capacity could result in increased backlog which may limit our ability to respond to orders with short lead times 

people are a key resource to developing manufacturing and delivering our products and services to our customers around the world our ability to manage the recruiting training retention and efficient usage of the highly skilled workforce required by our plans and to manage the associated costs could impact our business a welltrained motivated workforce has a positive impact on our ability to attract and retain business periods of rapid growth present a challenge to us and our industry to recruit train and retain our employees while also managing the impact of wage inflation and the limited available qualified labor in the markets where we operate 

likewise if the economy or markets decline or other changes occur we may have to reduce utilization of our assets or adjust our workforce to control costs which may cause us to lose some of our skilled employees laborrelated actions including strikes slowdowns and facility occupations can also have a negative impact on our business 

our business could be impacted by geopolitical and terrorism threats in countries where we or our customers do business and our business operations may be impacted by civil unrest government expropriations andor epidemic outbreaks 

geopolitical and terrorism risks continue to grow in a number of key countries where we currently or may in the future do business geopolitical and terrorism risks could lead to among other things a loss of our investment in the country impairment of the safety of our employees and impairment of our or our customers’ ability to conduct operations 

in addition to other geopolitical and terrorism risks civil unrest continues to grow in a number of key countries where we do business our ability to conduct business operations may be impacted by that civil unrest and our assets in these countries may also be subject to expropriation by governments or other parties involved in civil unrest epidemic outbreaks may also impact our business operations by among other things restricting travel to protect the health and welfare of our employees and decisions by our customers to curtail or stop operations in impacted areas 

bhge 2017 form 10k  12 

compliance with and changes in laws could be costly and could affect operating results in addition government disruptions could negatively impact our ability to conduct our business 

we have operations in the united states and in more than 120 countries that can be impacted by expected and unexpected changes in the legal and business environments in which we operate compliancerelated issues could also limit our ability to do business in certain countries and impact our earnings changes that could impact the legal environment include new legislation new regulations new policies investigations and legal proceedings and new interpretations of existing legal rules and regulations in particular changes in export control laws or exchange control laws additional restrictions on doing business in countries subject to sanctions and changes in laws in countries where we operate in addition changes and uncertainty in the political environments in which our businesses operate can have a material effect on the laws rules and regulations that affect our operations government disruptions may also delay or halt the granting and renewal of permits licenses and other items required by us and our customers to conduct our business the continued success of our global business and operations depends in part on our ability to continue to anticipate and effectively manage these and other political legal and regulatory risks 

increased cybersecurity requirements vulnerabilities threats and more sophisticated and targeted computer crime could pose risks to our systems networks products solutions services and data 

increased global cybersecurity vulnerabilities threats and more sophisticated and targeted cyberrelated attacks pose risks to our systems networks products solutions services and data cybersecurity attacks also pose risks to our customers’ partners’ suppliers’ and thirdparty service providers’ products systems and networks and the confidentiality availability and integrity of our and our customers’ data while we attempt to mitigate these risks we remain vulnerable to additional known or unknown threats given our global footprint the large number of customers with which we do business and the increasing sophistication of cyber attacks a cyber attack could occur and persist for an extended period of time without detection we expect that any investigation of a cyber attack would be inherently unpredictable and that it would take time before the completion of any investigation and before there is availability of full and reliable information during such time we would not necessarily know the extent of the harm or how best to remediate it and certain errors or actions could be repeated or compounded before they are discovered and remediated all or any of which would further increase the costs and consequences of a cyber attack 

we also may have access to sensitive confidential or personal data or information in certain of our businesses that is subject to privacy and security laws regulations and customerimposed controls despite our efforts to protect sensitive confidential or personal data or information we may be vulnerable to material security breaches theft misplaced or lost data programming errors employee errors andor malfeasance that could potentially lead to the compromising of sensitive confidential or personal data or information improper use of our systems software solutions or networks unauthorized access use disclosure modification or destruction of information defective products production downtimes and operational disruptions in addition a cyberrelated attack could adversely impact our operating results and result in other negative consequences including damage to our reputation or competitiveness remediation or increased protection costs litigation or regulatory action 

our failure to comply with the foreign corrupt practices act fcpa and other similar laws could have a negative impact on our ongoing operations 

our ability to comply with the fcpa the uk bribery act and various other antibribery and anticorruption laws depends on the success of our ongoing compliance program including our ability to successfully manage our agents and business partners and supervise train and retain competent employees our compliance program depends on the efforts of our employees to comply with applicable law and our internal policies we could be subject to sanctions and civil and criminal prosecution as well as fines and penalties in the event of a finding of a violation of any of these laws by us or any of our employees 

antimoney laundering and antiterrorism financing laws could have significant adverse consequences for us 

we maintain an enterprisewide program designed to enable us to comply with all applicable antimoney laundering and antiterrorism financing laws and regulations including the bank secrecy act and the patriot act this program includes policies procedures processes and other internal controls designed to identify monitor manage and mitigate the risk of money laundering or terrorist financing posed by our products services customers and geographic locale these controls establish procedures and processes to detect and report suspicious 

bhge 2017 form 10k  13 

transactions perform customer due diligence respond to requests from law enforcement and meet all recordkeeping and reporting requirements related to particular transactions involving currency or monetary instruments we cannot be sure our programs and controls are or will remain effective to ensure our compliance with all applicable antimoney laundering and antiterrorism financing laws and regulations and our failure to comply could subject us to significant sanctions fines penalties and reputational harm all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

changes in tax laws or tax rates adverse positions taken by taxing authorities and tax audits could impact operating results 

changes in tax laws or tax rates changes in interpretation of tax laws the resolution of tax assessments or audits by various tax authorities and the ability to fully utilize tax loss carryforwards and tax credits could impact our operating results including additional valuation allowances for deferred tax assets in addition we may periodically restructure our legal entity organization if taxing authorities were to disagree with our tax positions in connection with any such restructurings our effective tax rate could be materially impacted our tax filings for various periods will be subject to audit by the tax authorities in most jurisdictions where we conduct business for example tax assessments have been received from various taxing authorities and are currently at varying stages of appeals andor litigation regarding these matters these audits may result in assessment of additional taxes that are resolved with the authorities or through the courts we believe these assessments may occasionally be based on erroneous and even arbitrary interpretations of local tax law resolution of any tax matter involves uncertainties and there are no assurances that the outcomes will be favorable 

our operations involve a variety of operating hazards and risks that could cause losses 

the products that we manufacture and the services that we provide are complex and the failure of our equipment to operate properly or to meet specifications may greatly increase our customers’ costs in addition many of these products are used in inherently hazardous industries such as the offshore oilfield business these hazards include blowouts explosions nuclearrelated events fires collisions capsizings and severe weather conditions these hazards could result in personal injury and loss of life severe damage to or destruction of property and equipment pollution or environmental damage and suspension of operations as well as adversely affect our brand and reputation which is a key asset to our business we may incur substantial liabilities or losses as a result of these hazards while we maintain insurance protection against some of these risks and seek to obtain indemnity agreements from our customers requiring the customers to hold us harmless from some of these risks our insurance and contractual indemnity protection may not be sufficient or effective to protect us under all circumstances or against all risks the occurrence of a significant event against which we were not fully insured or indemnified or the failure of a customer to meet its indemnification obligations to us could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

compliance with and rulings and litigation in connection with environmental regulations and the environmental impacts of our or our customers’ operations may adversely affect our business and operating results 

we and our business are impacted by material changes in environmental laws regulations rulings and litigation our expectations regarding our compliance with environmental laws and regulations and our expenditures to comply with environmental laws and regulations including without limitation our capital expenditures for environmental control equipment are only our forecasts regarding these matters these forecasts may be substantially different from actual results which may be affected by factors such as changes in law that impose restrictions on air emissions wastewater management waste disposal hydraulic fracturing or wetland and land use practices more stringent enforcement of existing environmental laws and regulations a change in our share of any remediation costs or other unexpected adverse outcomes with respect to sites where we have been named as a potentially responsible party including without limitation superfund sites the discovery of other sites where additional expenditures may be required to comply with environmental legal obligations and the accidental discharge of hazardous materials 

international national and state governments and agencies continue to evaluate and promulgate legislation and regulations that are focused on restricting emissions commonly referred to as greenhouse gas ghg emissions in the united states the us environmental protection agency epa has taken steps to regulate ghg emissions as air pollutants under the us clean air act of 1970 as amended the epa’s greenhouse gas reporting rule requires monitoring and reporting of ghg emissions from among others certain mobile and stationary ghg emission sources in the oil and natural gas industry which in turn may include data from certain of 

bhge 2017 form 10k  14 

our wellsite equipment and operations in addition the us government has proposed rules in the past setting ghg emission standards for or otherwise aimed at reducing ghg emissions from the oil and natural gas industry caps on carbon emissions including in the united states have been and may continue to be established and the cost of such caps could disproportionately affect the fossilfuel energy sector we are unable to predict whether the proposed changes in laws or regulations ultimately will occur or what they ultimately will require and accordingly we are unable to assess the potential financial or operational impact they may have on our business 

other developments focused on restricting ghg emissions include the united nations framework convention on climate change which includes the paris agreement and the kyoto protocol the european union emission trading system the united kingdom’s crc energy efficiency and esos schemes and in the united states the regional greenhouse gas initiative the western climate action initiative and various state programs implementing the california global warming solutions act of 2006 known as assembly bill 32 

current or future legislation regulations and developments including those related to climate change may curtail production and demand for hydrocarbons such as oil and natural gas in areas of the world where our customers operate by shifting demand towards relatively lower carbon energy sources such as wind solar and other renewables many governments are providing tax advantages and other subsidies and promoting technological research to support renewable energy sources or are mandating the use of renewable fuels or technologies these governmental initiatives as well as increased societal awareness of climate change impacts have also resulted in increased investor and consumer demand for renewable energy any resulting reduction in demand for oil and natural gas could adversely affect future demand for our services and products which may in turn adversely affect future results of operations 

uninsured claims and litigation against us could adversely impact our operating results 

we could be impacted by the outcome of pending litigation as well as unexpected litigation or proceedings while we have insurance coverage against operating hazards including product liability claims and personal injury claims related to our products to the extent deemed prudent by our management and to the extent insurance is available no assurance can be given that the nature and amount of that insurance will be sufficient to fully indemnify us against liabilities arising out of pending and future claims and litigation this insurance has deductibles or selfinsured retentions and contains certain coverage exclusions the insurance does not cover damages from breach of contract by us or based on alleged fraud or deceptive trade practices in addition the following risks apply with respect to our insurance coverage 

 control of oil and natural gas reserves by stateowned oil companies may impact the demand for our services and products and create additional risks in our operations 

much of the world’s oil and natural gas reserves are controlled by stateowned oil companies stateowned oil companies may require their contractors to meet local content requirements or other local standards such as conducting our operations through joint ventures with local partners that could be difficult or undesirable for us to meet the failure to meet the local content requirements and other local standards may adversely impact our operations in those countries in addition our ability to work with stateowned oil companies is subject to our ability to negotiate and agree upon acceptable contract terms 

providing services on an integrated or turnkey basis could require us to assume additional risks 

many stateowned oil companies and other operators may require integrated contracts or turnkey contracts and we may choose to provide services outside our core business providing services on an integrated or turnkey basis may subject us to additional risks such as costs associated with unexpected delays or difficulties in drilling or completion operations and risks associated with subcontracting arrangements 

bhge 2017 form 10k  15 

some of our customers require bids in the form of longterm fixed pricing contracts 

some of our customers require bids for contracts in the form of longterm fixed pricing contracts that may require us to provide integrated project management services outside our normal discrete business and to act as project managers as well as service providers and may require us to assume additional risks associated with cost overruns these customers may provide us with inaccurate information in relation to their reserves the estimation of reserves is a process that involves subjective judgment about likely location and volume and estimates that prove inaccurate may result in cost overruns delays and project losses for us or our customers which may adversely impact our business 

providing services on an integrated basis may also require us to assume additional risks associated with operating cost inflation labor availability and productivity supplier pricing and performance and potential claims for liquidated damages we typically rely on thirdparty subcontractors and equipment providers to assist us with the completion of these types of contracts to the extent that we cannot engage subcontractors or acquire equipment or materials in a timely manner and on reasonable terms our ability to complete a project in accordance with stated deadlines or at a profit may be impaired if the amount we are required to pay for these goods and services exceeds the amount we have estimated in bidding for fixedprice work we could experience losses in the performance of these contracts these delays and additional costs may be substantial and we may be required to compensate our customers for these delays this may reduce the profit to be realized or result in a loss on a project or harm to our relationships with our customers 

the credit risks of having a concentrated customer base in the energy industry could result in losses 

having a concentration of customers in the energy industry may impact our overall exposure to credit risk as our customers may be similarly affected by prolonged changes in economic and industry conditions some of our customers may experience extreme financial distress as a result of falling commodity prices and may be forced to seek protection under applicable bankruptcy laws which may affect our ability to recover any amounts due from such customers furthermore countries that rely heavily upon income from hydrocarbon exports have been and may in the future be negatively and significantly affected by a drop in oil prices which could affect our ability to collect from our customers in these countries particularly national oil companies laws in some jurisdictions in which we will operate could make collection difficult or time consuming we will perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and do not expect to require collateral in support of our trade receivables while we maintain reserves for potential credit losses we cannot assure such reserves will be sufficient to meet writeoffs of uncollectible receivables or that our losses from such receivables will be consistent with our expectations additionally in the event of a bankruptcy of any of our customers we may be treated as an unsecured creditor and may collect substantially less or none of the amounts owed to us by such customer 

our backlog is subject to modification termination or reduction of orders which could negatively impact our sales 

our backlog is comprised of unfilled customer orders for products and product services expected life of contract sales for product services our backlog can be significantly affected by the timing of orders for large projects although modifications and terminations of orders may be partially offset by cancellation fees customers can and sometimes do terminate or modify orders our failure to replace canceled orders could negatively impact our sales and results of operations the total dollar amount of the company’s backlog as of december 31 2017 was 21022 million  

we may not be able to satisfy technical requirements testing requirements or other specifications required under our service contracts and equipment purchase agreements 

our products are used in deepwater and other harsh environments and severe service applications our contracts with customers and customer requests for bids typically set forth detailed specifications or technical requirements for our products and services which may also include extensive testing requirements we anticipate that such testing requirements will become more common in our contracts in addition recent scrutiny of the offshore drilling industry has resulted in more stringent technical specifications for our products and more comprehensive testing requirements for our products to ensure compliance with such specifications we cannot provide assurance that our products will be able to satisfy the specifications or that we will be able to perform the fullscale testing necessary to prove that the product specifications are satisfied in future contract bids or under existing contracts or that the costs of modifications to our products to satisfy the specifications and testing will not adversely affect our results of operations if our products are unable to satisfy such requirements or we are unable 

bhge 2017 form 10k  16 

to perform any required fullscale testing our customers may cancel their contracts andor seek new suppliers and our business results of operations cash flows or financial position may be adversely affected 

currency fluctuations or devaluations may impact our operating results 

fluctuations or devaluations in foreign currencies relative to the us dollar can impact our revenue and our costs of doing business as well as the costs of doing business of our customers most of our products and services are sold through contracts denominated in us dollars or local currency indexed to us dollars however some of our revenue local expenses and manufacturing costs are incurred in local currencies and therefore changes in the exchange rates between the us dollar and foreign currencies can increase or decrease our revenue and expenses reported in us dollars or revenue and expenses of our customers and consequently may impact the ability of our customers to satisfy their payment obligations and our results of operations 

changes in economic andor market conditions may impact our ability to borrow andor cost of borrowing 

the condition of the capital markets and equity markets in general can affect the price of our common stock and our ability to obtain financing if necessary if our credit rating is ever downgraded it could increase borrowing costs under credit facilities and commercial paper programs as well as increase the cost of renewing or obtaining or make it more difficult to renew obtain or issue new debt financing 

an inability to protect our intellectual property rights could adversely affect our business 

there can be no assurance that the steps we take to obtain maintain and protect our intellectual property rights will be completely adequate our intellectual property rights may fail to provide us with significant competitive advantages particularly in foreign jurisdictions where we have not invested in an intellectual property portfolio or that do not have or do not enforce strong intellectual property rights the weakening of protection of our trademarks patents and other intellectual property rights could also adversely affect our business 

we are a party to a number of licenses that give us rights to intellectual property that is necessary or useful to our business including from ge following the transactions our success depends in part on the ability of our licensors to obtain maintain and sufficiently enforce the licensed intellectual property rights we have commercialized without protection for the intellectual property rights we license other companies might be able to offer substantially identical products for sale which could adversely affect our competitive business position and harm our business products also there can be no assurances that we will be able to obtain or renew from third parties the licenses to use intellectual property rights we need in the future and there is no assurance that such licenses can be obtained on reasonable terms specifically we are a party to several agreements with ge which provide for intellectual property rights to use and access access and use of intellectual property created solely or collaboratively with ge is an important part of our operations we would be adversely affected in the event these agreements were terminated without the right to continue such access as we might continue to improve current products and services or develop new ones 

we may be subject to litigation if another party claims that we have infringed upon its intellectual property rights 

the tools techniques methodologies programs and components we use to provide our products and services may infringe upon the intellectual property rights of others or be challenged on that basis regardless of the merits infringement claims may result in significant legal and other costs and may distract management from running our core business resolving such claims could increase our costs including through royalty payments to acquire licenses if available from third parties and through the development of noninfringing technologies if a license to resolve a claim were not available we might not be able to continue providing a particular service or product which could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

risk factors related to the worldwide oil and natural gas industry 

volatility of oil and natural gas prices can adversely affect demand for our products and services 

prices of oil and gas products are set on a commodity basis as a result the volatility in oil and natural gas prices can impact our customers’ activity levels and spending for our products and services current energy prices are important contributors to cash flow for our customers and their ability to fund exploration and development activities although oil prices have risen over the past year this increase follows a decline through most of 2016 

bhge 2017 form 10k  17 

and uncertainty remains about the trajectory of oil prices going forward expectations about future prices and price volatility are important for determining future spending levels 

lower oil and natural gas prices generally lead to decreased spending by our customers while higher oil and natural gas prices generally lead to increased spending by our customers sustained high energy prices can be an impediment to economic growth and can therefore negatively impact spending by our customers our customers also take into account the volatility of energy prices and other risk factors by requiring higher returns for individual projects if there is higher perceived risk any of these factors could affect the demand for oil and natural gas and could have a material effect on our results of operations 

demand for oil and natural gas is subject to factors beyond our control which may adversely affect our operating results changes in the global economy could impact our customers’ spending levels and our revenue and operating results 

demand for oil and natural gas as well as the demand for our services and products is highly correlated with global economic growth and in particular by the economic growth of countries such as the us india china and developing countries in asia and the middle east which are either significant users of oil and natural gas or whose economies are experiencing the most rapid economic growth compared to the global average weakness or deterioration of the global economy or credit markets could reduce our customers’ spending levels and reduce our revenue and operating results incremental weakness in global economic activity particularly in china india europe the middle east and developing countries in asia could reduce demand for oil and natural gas and result in lower oil and natural gas prices incremental strength in global economic activity in such areas will create more demand for oil and natural gas and support higher oil and natural gas prices a prolonged reduction in oil and natural gas prices may require us to record additional asset impairments such a potential impairment charge could have a material adverse impact on our operating results   

requirements and voluntary initiatives to reduce emissions as well as increased climate change awareness are likely to result in increased costs for the oil and gas industry to curb emissions and could have an adverse impact on demand for oil and natural gas 

international national and state governments agencies and bodies continue to evaluate and promulgate regulations and voluntary initiatives that are focused on restricting ghg emissions these requirements and initiatives are likely to become more stringent over time and to result in increased costs for the oil and gas industry to curb ghg emissions in addition these developments may curtail production and demand for hydrocarbons such as oil and natural gas by shifting demand towards and investment in relatively lower carbon energy sources such as wind solar and other renewables the renewable energy industry is developing enhanced technologies and becoming more competitive with fossilfuel energy if renewable energy becomes more competitive than fossilfuel energy particularly during periods of higher oil and natural gas prices it could have a material effect on our results of operations please see the section entitled risk factors related to our businesscompliance with and rulings and litigation in connection with environmental regulations and the environmental impacts of our or our customers’ operations may adversely affect our business and operating results 

supply of oil and natural gas is subject to factors beyond our control which may adversely affect our operating results 

productive capacity for oil and natural gas is dependent on our customers’ decisions to develop and produce oil and natural gas reserves and on the regulatory environment in which our customers and we operate the ability to produce oil and natural gas can be affected by the number and productivity of new wells drilled and completed as well as the rate of production and resulting depletion of existing wells advanced technologies such as horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing improve total recovery but also result in a more rapid production decline and may become subject to more stringent regulation particularly on the state or local level in the future 

productive capacity in excess of demand “spare productive capacity” is also an important factor influencing energy prices and spending by oil and natural gas exploration companies spare productive capacity and oil and natural gas storage inventory levels are an indicator of the relative balance between supply and demand high or increasing storage inventories or spare productive capacity generally indicate that supply is exceeding demand and that energy prices are likely to soften low or decreasing storage inventories or spare productive capacity are generally an indicator that demand is growing faster than supply and that energy prices are likely to rise 

bhge 2017 form 10k  18 

access to prospects is also important to our customers but such access may be limited because host governments do not allow access to the reserves government regulations and the costs incurred by oil and natural gas exploration companies to conform to and comply with government regulations may also limit the quantity of oil and natural gas that may be economically produced 

supply can also be impacted by the degree to which individual opec nations and other large oil and natural gas producing countries including but not limited to norway and russia are willing and able to control production and exports of oil to decrease or increase supply and to support their targeted oil price while meeting their market share objectives any of these factors could affect the supply of oil and natural gas and could have a material effect on our results of operations 

our customers’ activity levels and spending for our products and services and ability to pay amounts owed us could be impacted by the reduction of their cash flow and the ability of our customers to access equity or credit markets 

our customers’ access to capital is dependent on their ability to access the funds necessary to develop economically attractive projects based upon their expectations of future energy prices required investments and resulting returns limited access to external sources of funding has caused and may continue to cause customers to reduce their capital spending plans to levels supported by internally generated cash flow in addition a reduction of cash flow resulting from declines in commodity prices a reduction in borrowing bases under reservebased credit facilities or the lack of available debt or equity financing may impact the ability of our customers to pay amounts owed to us and could cause us to increase our reserve for doubtful accounts 

seasonal and weather conditions could adversely affect demand for our services and operations 

variation from normal weather patterns such as cooler or warmer summers and winters can have a significant impact on demand for our services and operations adverse weather conditions such as hurricanes in the gulf of mexico may interrupt or curtail our operations or our customers’ operations cause supply disruptions and result in a loss of revenue and damage to our equipment and facilities which may or may not be insured for example extreme winter conditions in canada russia or the north sea may interrupt or curtail our operations or our customers’ operations in those areas and result in a loss of revenue 

risk factors related to the transactions 

we may experience challenges relating to the ongoing integration of baker hughes incorporated and ge og that may result in a decline in the anticipated benefits of the transactions 

the transactions involved the combination of two businesses that previously operated as independent businesses the company has been and will continue to be required to devote management attention and resources to integrating its business practices and operations 

if we experience difficulties with the integration process the anticipated benefits of the transactions may not be realized fully or at all may take longer to realize than expected or be offset by the decrease in business from certain customers these integration matters could have an adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition or other prospects on an ongoing basis 

we have incurred and will continue to incur transactionrelated and restructuring costs in connection with the transactions and the integration of the two businesses 

we have incurred transactionrelated and restructuring costs in connection with the transactions and will continue to incur such costs in connection with the integration of the businesses of baker hughes incorporated and ge og there are many systems that must be successfully integrated including information management purchasing accounting and finance sales billing payroll and benefits fixed asset and lease administration systems and regulatory compliance we are still assessing the magnitude of these costs and therefore are not able to provide estimates of these costs 

the costs related to restructuring have been included as a liability in the purchase price allocation or expensed as incurred depending on the nature of the restructuring activity moreover many of the expenses that will be incurred by their nature are difficult to estimate accurately these expenses could particularly in the near term reduce the cost synergies that we achieve from the elimination of duplicative expenses and the realization of 

bhge 2017 form 10k  19 

economies of scale and cost synergies related to the integration of the businesses following the completion of the transactions and accordingly any net synergies may not be achieved in the near term or at all these integration expenses may result in us taking significant charges against earnings following the completion of the transactions 

we are a “controlled company” within the meaning of the nyse rules and as a result qualify for and are relying on exemptions from certain corporate governance requirements as a result our stockholders do not have the same protections afforded to stockholders of companies that are subject to such requirements the interests of ge as a controlling stockholder may differ from the interests of other stockholders of the company 

through its ownership of a majority of the company’s voting power and the provisions set forth in the company charter the company bylaws and the stockholders agreement ge has the ability to designate and elect a majority of the company’s directors as a result of ge’s ownership of a majority of the voting power of common stock the company is a “controlled company” as defined in nyse listing rules and therefore is not subject to nyse requirements that would otherwise require the company to have i a majority of independent directors ii a nominating committee composed solely of independent directors iii the compensation of its executive officers determined by a majority of the independent directors or a compensation committee composed solely of independent directors and iv director nominees selected or recommended for the board’s selection either by a majority of the independent directors or a nominating committee composed solely of independent directors under the stockholders agreement our board will generally have four directors not designated by ge and five directors designated by ge 

ge also has control over certain matters submitted to stockholders for approval including changes in capital structure transactions requiring stockholder approval under delaware law and corporate governance subject to the terms of the stockholders agreement relating to ge’s agreement to vote in favor of director nominees not designated by ge and to proposals by ge to acquire all of the shares of common stock held by nonge stockholders ge may have different interests than other holders of class a common stock 

among other things ge’s control could delay defer or prevent a sale of the company that the company’s other stockholders support or conversely this control could result in the consummation of such a transaction that other stockholders do not support this concentrated control could discourage a potential investor from seeking to acquire class a common stock and as a result might harm the market price of that class a common stock 

given ge’s ownership of the majority of the outstanding voting securities of the company and the interactions that have and will take place between the company and ge through the ge store and otherwise the success of the company depends in part on the reputation and success of ge 

if we were to cease being a majorityowned subsidiary of ge in the future such a separation could adversely affect our business and profitability uncertainty about the likelihood of any such separation could also adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

as a subsidiary of ge we market many of our products and services using the “ge” brand name and logo we believe that the association with ge provides many benefits including a strong brand broad research and development capabilities elevated status with suppliers and customers and established relationships with regulators 

although ge has licensed to us the right to use certain “ge” marks in its corporate name and in the products and services of our business in connection with certain oil and gas activities and other discrete oil and gas segments that right to use these marks would be lost if the license were to expire or otherwise terminate 

in addition if we were to cease being a majorityowned subsidiary of ge or there were otherwise a meaningful change in the relationships between ge and the company such an events could adversely affect among other things our ability to attract and retain customers among other things we may be required to provide more favorable pricing and other terms to our customers and take other action to maintain our relationship with existing and attract new customers all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations for example although ge would be subject to certain noncompete restrictions for a period of time following the company no longer being a majorityowned subsidiary of ge in the absence of an agreement regulating the gotomarket strategy and the reciprocal commercial and technical support between ge and the company ge may attempt to compete with us with respect to certain technologies and customer projects where we have adjacent or overlapping presence eg steam turbines and gas turbines furthermore we may

managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations mda should be read in conjunction with the condensed consolidated   and combined financial statements included in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data contained herein 

executive summary 

on july 3 2017 we closed the transactions to combine ge og and baker hughes creating a fullstream oilfield technology provider that has a unique mix of integrated oilfield products services and digital solutions as a result of the transactions bhge became the holding company of the combined businesses the transactions were executed using a partnership structure pursuant to which ge og and baker hughes each contributed their operating assets to a newly formed partnership bhge llc ge holds an approximate 625 controlling interest in this partnership and former baker hughes stockholders hold an approximate 375 interest through the ownership of 100 of our class a common stock the results of operations for the company include the results of baker hughes from july 3 2017 the date of acquisition through december 31 2017 the majority of the baker hughes business operations are included in the oilfield services segment the transactions were treated as a “reverse acquisition” for accounting purposes and as such the historical financial statements of the accounting acquirer ge og are the historical financial statements of the company the current year results and balances may not be comparable to prior years as the current year includes the results of baker hughes from july 3 2017 we operate through our four business segments oilfield services ofs oilfield equipment ofe turbomachinery  processing solutions tps and digital solutions ds as of december 31 2017 bhge employs over 64000  employees and operates in more than 120 countries 

in 2017 we generated revenue of 17259 million  compared to 13269 million  in 2016 the increase in revenue was driven primarily by ofs as a result of the acquisition of baker hughes and to a lesser extent by ds partially offset by declines in tps and ofe loss before income taxes and equity in loss of affiliate was 160 million in 2017 and included restructuring and impairment charges of 412 million  and merger and related costs of 373 million  these restructuring and impairment charges were recorded as a result of our continued actions to adjust our operations and cost structure to reflect reduced activity levels in 2016 income before income taxes and equity in loss of affiliate was 584 million  which also included restructuring and impairment charges of 516 million  and merger and related costs of 33 million  

outlook 

our business is exposed to a number of different macro factors which influence our expectations and outlook all of our outlook expectations are purely based on the market as we see it today and are subject to change given volatile conditions in the industry 



bhge 2017 form 10k  26 

the short term we do however view the long term economics of the lng industry as positive given our outlook for supply and demand 

 we have other segments in our portfolio that are more correlated with different industrial metrics such as our digital solutions business overall we believe our portfolio is uniquely positioned to compete across the value chain and deliver unique solutions for our customers we remain optimistic about the longterm economics of the industry but are continuing to operate with flexibility given our expectations for volatility and changing assumptions in the near term 

in 2016 solar and wind net additions exceeded coal and gas for the first time and it continued throughout 2017 governments may change or may not continue incentives for renewable energy additions in the long term renewables cost decline may accelerate to compete with newbuilt fossil capacity however we do not anticipate any significant impacts to our business in the foreseeable future 

despite the nearterm volatility the longterm outlook for our industry remains strong we believe the world’s demand for energy will continue to rise and the supply of energy will continue to increase in complexity requiring greater service intensity and more advanced technology from oilfield service companies as such we remain focused on delivering innovative costefficient solutions that deliver step changes in operating and economic performance for our customers 

business environment 

the following discussion and analysis summarizes the significant factors affecting our results of operations financial condition and liquidity position as of and for the year ended december 31 2017 2016 and 2015 and should be read in conjunction with the consolidated and combined financial statements and related notes of the company amounts reported in millions in graphs within this report are computed based on the amounts in hundreds as a result the sum of the components reported in millions may not equal the total amount reported in millions due to rounding  

we operate in more than 120  countries helping customers find evaluate drill produce transport and process hydrocarbon resources our revenue is predominately generated from the sale of products and services to major national and independent oil and natural gas companies worldwide and is dependent on spending by our customers for oil and natural gas exploration field development and production this spending is driven by a number of factors including our customers forecasts of future energy demand and supply their access to resources to develop and produce oil and natural gas their ability to fund their capital programs the impact of new government regulations and most importantly their expectations for oil and natural gas prices as a key driver of their cash flows 

oil and natural gas prices 

oil and natural gas prices are summarized in the table below as averages of the daily closing prices during each of the periods indicated 





bhge 2017 form 10k  27 

 outside north america customer spending is most heavily influenced by brent oil prices which fluctuated significantly throughout the year ranging from a low of 4398bbl in june 2017 to a high of 6880bbl in december 2017 oil prices bottomed early in 2016 due to the impending production increases in iran after economic sanctions were lifted during 2017 opec considered production cuts and in the fourth quarter they announced extensions to agreedupon production cuts as a result in the fourth quarter of 2017 brent oil prices shifted meaningfully higher in addition demand for oil was higher than expected due to robust consumption in north america and revisions to chinese russian and european demand growth expectations 

in north america customer spending is highly driven by wti oil prices which similar to brent oil prices fluctuated significantly throughout the year with the highest prices being recorded towards the end of the year overall wti oil prices ranged from a low of 4248bbl in june 2017 to a high of 6046bbl in december 2017 

although oil prices have rebounded more than 100 from the previous years twelveyear low of 26bbl reached in february 2016 to near 60bbl at the end of 2017 there has yet to be any material change in customer behavior other than in certain us basins to suggest a nearterm broader recovery in activity levels 

in north america natural gas prices as measured by the henry hub natural gas spot price averaged 299 mmbtu in 2017 representing a 19 increase over the prior year throughout the year henry hub natural gas spot prices ranged from a high of 371 mmbtu in january 2017 to a low of 244 mmbtu in february 2017 according to the us department of energy doe working natural gas in storage at the end of 2017 was 3126 billion cubic feet bcf which was 56 or 185 bcf below the corresponding week in 2016 

baker hughes rig count 

the baker hughes rig counts are an important business barometer for the drilling industry and its suppliers when drilling rigs are active they consume products and services produced by the oil service industry rig count trends are driven by the exploration and development spending by oil and natural gas companies which in turn is influenced by current and future price expectations for oil and natural gas the counts may reflect the relative strength and stability of energy prices and overall market activity however these counts should not be solely relied on as other specific and pervasive conditions may exist that affect overall energy prices and market activity 

we have been providing rig counts to the public since 1944 we gather all relevant data through our field service personnel who obtain the necessary data from routine visits to the various rigs customers contractors and other outside sources as necessary we base the classification of a well as either oil or natural gas primarily upon filings made by operators in the relevant jurisdiction this data is then compiled and distributed to various wire services and trade associations and is published on our website we believe the counting process and resulting data is reliable however it is subject to our ability to obtain accurate and timely information rig counts are compiled weekly for the us and canada and monthly for all international rigs published international rig counts do not include rigs drilling in certain locations such as russia the caspian region iran and onshore china because this information is not readily available 

rigs in the us and canada are counted as active if on the day the count is taken the well being drilled has been started but drilling has not been completed and the well is anticipated to be of sufficient depth to be a potential consumer of our drill bits in international areas rigs are counted on a weekly basis and deemed active if drilling activities occurred during the majority of the week the weekly results are then averaged for the month and published accordingly the rig count does not include rigs that are in transit from one location to another rigging up being used in nondrilling activities including production testing completion and workover and are not expected to be significant consumers of drill bits 

bhge 2017 form 10k  28 

the rig counts are summarized in the table below as averages for each of the periods indicated 



2017  compared to 2016 

overall the rig count was 2030 in 2017 an increase of 27 as compared to 2016 due primarily to north american activity the rig count in north america increased 69 in 2017 compared to 2016 internationally the rig count decreased 1 in 2017 as compared to the same period last year 

within north america the increase was primarily driven by the land rig count which was up 72 partially offset by a decrease in the offshore rig count of 16 internationally the rig count decrease was driven primarily by decreases in latin america of 7 the europe region and africa region which were down by 4 and 2 respectively partially offset by the asiapacific region which was up 8 

2016  compared to 2015 

overall the rig count was 1598 in 2016 a decrease of 32 as compared to 2015 due primarily to north american activity the rig count in north america decreased   46  in 2016  compared to 2015  internationally the rig count decreased   18  in 2016  compared to 2015  

within north america the decrease was primarily driven by a 44 decline in oildirected rigs the natural gasdirected rig count in north america declined 50 in 2016 as natural gas well productivity improved internationally the rig count decrease was driven primarily by decreases in latin america which was down 38 the africa region which was down 20 and the europe region and asiapacific region which were down 18 and 15 respectively

orders  in 2017 we recognized orders of 17376 million an increase of 6103 million or 54 from 2016 the increase in orders was driven primarily by the acquisition of baker hughes service orders were up 38 and equipment orders were up 87 

in 2016 we recognized orders of 11273 million a decrease of 4112 million from 2015 driven by broader market conditions we continued to see delays in final investment decisions on projects and pricing pressure 

backlog  as of december 31 2017 backlog was 21022 million a decrease of 675 million or 3 from 2016 equipment backlog decreased from 2016 primarily driven by a lower intake of large equipment orders service backlog increased from 2016 as a result of order intake 

as of december 31 2016 backlog was 21697 million a decrease of 2244 million from 2015 primarily driven by the decrease in equipment backlog of 32 as well as the strengthening of the us dollar which accounted for a decrease of 309 million services backlog increased by 5 to 15223 million backlog remains strong and provides an indication of longterm revenue within the company 

results of operations 

the discussions below relating to significant line items from our consolidated and combined statements of income loss are based on available information and represent our analysis of significant changes or events that impact the comparability of reported amounts where appropriate we have identified specific events and changes that affect comparability or trends and where reasonably practicable have quantified the impact of such items in addition the discussions below for revenue and cost of revenue are on a total basis as the business drivers for product sales and services are similar all dollar amounts in tabulations in this section are in millions of dollars unless otherwise stated certain columns and rows may not add due to the use of rounded numbers 

the results of operations for the company include the results of baker hughes from july 3 2017 the date of acquisition through the end of the year ended december 31 2017 our results of operations are evaluated by the chief executive officer on a combined and consolidated basis as well as at the segment level 

bhge 2017 form 10k  30 

the performance of our operating segments is evaluated based on segment operating income loss which is defined as income loss before income taxes and equity in loss of affiliate and before the following net interest expense net other non operating income loss corporate expenses restructuring impairment and other charges inventory impairment merger and related costs goodwill impairment and certain gains and losses not allocated to the operating segments 

in evaluating the segment performance the company uses the following 

volume  price   volume is the increase or decrease in products andor services sold periodoverperiod excluding the impact of foreign exchange and price the volume impact on profit is calculated by multiplying the prior period profit rate by the change in revenue volume between the current and prior period price is defined as the change in sales price for a comparable product or service periodoverperiod and is calculated as the periodoverperiod change in sales prices of comparable products and services 

foreign exchange fx    fx measures the translational foreign exchange impact or the translation impact of the periodoverperiod change on sales and costs directly attributable to change in the foreign exchange rate compared to the us dollar fx impact is calculated by multiplying the functional currency amounts revenue or profit with the periodoverperiod fx rate variance using the average exchange rate for the respective period 

inflationdeflation  inflationdeflation is defined as the increase or decrease in direct and indirect costs of the same type for an equal amount of volume it is calculated as the yearoveryear change in cost ie price paid of direct material compensation  benefits and overhead costs 

productivity  productivity is measured by the remaining variance in profit after adjusting for the periodoverperiod impact of volume  price foreign exchange and inflationdeflation as defined above improved or lower periodoverperiod cost productivity is the result of cost efficiencies or inefficiencies such as cost decreasing or increasing more than volume or cost increasing or decreasing less than volume or changes in sales mix among segments this also includes the periodoverperiod variance of transactional foreign exchange aside from those foreign currency devaluations that are reported separately for business evaluation purposes

liquidity and capital resources 

our objective in financing our business is to maintain sufficient liquidity adequate financial resources and financial flexibility in order to fund the requirements of our business at december 31 2017  we had cash and equivalents of 70 billion  compared to 981 million  of cash and equivalents at december 31 2016 cash and equivalents includes 997 million of cash held on behalf of ge at december 31 2017 

at december 31 2017  approximately 32 billion of our cash and equivalents was held by foreign subsidiaries compared to approximately 878 million at december 31 2016 a substantial portion of the cash held by foreign subsidiaries at december 31 2017 has been reinvested in active nonus business operations at december 31 2017 our intent is among other things to use this cash to fund the operations of our foreign subsidiaries and we have not changed our indefinite reinvestment decision as a result of us tax reform but will reassess this during the course of 2018 if we decide at a later date to repatriate those funds to the us we may be required to provide taxes on certain of those funds however due to the enactment of us tax reform repatriations of foreign earnings will generally be free of us federal tax but may incur other taxes such as withholding or state taxes 

on july 3 2017 in connection with the transactions bhge llc entered into a new fiveyear 3 billion committed unsecured revolving credit facility 2017 credit agreement with commercial banks maturing in july 2022 as of december 31 2017  there were no borrowings under the 2017 credit agreement 

on november 3 2017 bhge llc entered into a commercial paper program under which it may issue from time to time up to 3 billion  in commercial paper with maturities of no more than 397 days at december 31 2017  there were no borrowings outstanding under the commercial paper program the maximum combined borrowing at any time under both the 2017 credit agreement and the commercial paper program is 3 billion  

on november 6 2017 we announced that our board of directors authorized bhge llc to repurchase up to 3 billion of its common units from the company and ge the proceeds of such repurchase that are distributed to the company will be used to repurchase class a shares of the company on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions 

on december 15 2017 we filed a shelf registration statement on form s3 with the sec to give us the ability to sell up to 3 billion in debt securities in amounts to be determined at the time of an offering any such offering if it does occur may happen in one or more transactions the specific terms of any securities to be sold will be described in supplemental filings with the sec the registration statement will expire in 2020 

during the year ended december 31 2017  we used cash to fund a variety of activities including certain working capital needs and restructuring costs capital expenditures business acquisitions the payment of dividends and share repurchases we believe that cash on hand cash flows generated from operations and the available credit facility will provide sufficient liquidity to manage our global cash needs 

cash flows 

cash flows provided by used in each type of activity were as follows for the years ended december 31 



operating activities 

our largest source of operating cash is payments from customers of which the largest component is collecting cash related to product or services sales including advance payments or progress collections for work to be performed the primary use of operating cash is to pay our suppliers employees tax authorities and others for a wide range of material and services 

bhge 2017 form 10k  36 

cash flows from operating activities used cash of 799 million  and generated cash of 262 million  for the years ended december 31 2017  and 2016  respectively cash flows from operating activities decreased 1061 million in 2017  primarily driven by a 1201 million negative impact from ending our receivables monetization program in the fourth quarter and restructuring related payments throughout the year these cash outflows were partially offset by strong working capital cash flows especially in the fourth quarter of 2017 included in our cash flows from operating activities for 2017 and 2016 are payments of 612 million and 177 million respectively made for employee severance and contract termination costs as a result of our restructuring activities initiated during the year  

cash flows from operating activities generated 262 million and 1277 million for the years ended december 31 2016 and 2015 respectively cash flows from operating activities decreased 1015 million in 2016 primarily due to the decrease in net income partially offset by improvements in other working capital categories due to improvements in the collection of past due receivables improved inventory management and restructuring 

investing activities 

cash flows from investing activities used cash of 4130 million 472 million and 466 million for the years ended december 31 2017 2016 and 2015 respectively 

our principal recurring investing activity is the funding of capital expenditures to ensure that we have the appropriate levels and types of machinery and equipment in place to generate revenue from operations expenditures for capital assets totaled 665 million  424 million  and 607 million  for 2017  2016  and 2015  respectively partially offset by cash flows from the sale of property plant and equipment of 172 million 20 million and 30 million in 2017 2016 and 2015 respectively proceeds from the disposal of assets related primarily to equipment that was lostinhole and to property machinery and equipment no longer used in operations that was sold throughout the period 

in 2017 cash flows from investing activities also includes 7498 million of special dividend paid to former baker hughes stockholders on the acquisition of baker hughes net of 4133 million of cash received from the acquisition there were no material business dispositions in 2017 

there were no material acquisitions or dispositions in 2016 however in 2015 we generated cash of approximately 181 million from business dispositions and utilized cash of 86 million for business acquisitions 

financing activities 

cash flows from financing activities generated cash of 10919 million and used cash of 102 million and 515 million for the years ended december 31 2017 2016 and 2015 respectively 

in 2017 our primary source of financing cash flows was a contribution of 7400 million from ge to fund substantially all of the special dividend paid to former baker hughes stockholders we also generated financing cash flows of 3950 million from debt issued through a private placement offering on december 11 2017 we incurred issuance costs of 26 million related to this debt issuance 

we had net repayments of shortterm debt of 663 million  and 156 million  in 2017  and 2016  respectively and net borrowings of 177 million  in 2015  

in december 2017 we purchased 176 million of the aggregate outstanding principal amount associated with our longterm outstanding notes and debentures pursuant to a cash tender offer the purchases resulted in the payment of an earlytender premium including various fees of 28 million 

additionally in 2017 we paid aggregate dividends of 155 million to our class a stockholders and bhge llc made a distribution of 251 million to ge as part of our 3 billion share buyback authorization we used cash of 174 million and 303 million respectively to repurchase and cancel our class a and class b common shares and corresponding paired common units in bhge llc on a pro rata basis the repurchase did not result in a change of ges approximate 625 interest in bhge llc 

bhge 2017 form 10k  37 

cash flows from financing activities in 2017 also included net transfers from ge of 1498 million  primarily driven by the cash pooling activity with ge prior to the transactions other financing items during the year included a payment of 193 million to complete the purchase of the noncontrolling interest in the pipeline inspection and integrity business within digital solutions 

available credit facility and commercial paper program 

on july 3 2017 in connection with the transactions we entered into a new five year 3 billion  committed unsecured revolving credit facility the 2017 credit agreement with commercial banks maturing in july 2022 the 2017 credit agreement contains certain customary representations and warranties certain affirmative covenants and no negative covenants upon the occurrence of certain events of default our obligations under the 2017 credit agreement may be accelerated such events of default include payment defaults to lenders under the 2017 credit agreement and other customary defaults we were in compliance with all of the credit facilitys covenants and in 2017 there were no borrowings under the credit facility 

on november 3 2017 bhge llc entered into a commercial paper program under which it may issue from time to time up to 3 billion  in commercial paper with maturities of no more than 397 days at december 31 2017  we had no borrowings outstanding under the commercial paper program the maximum combined borrowing at any time under both the 2017 credit agreement and the commercial paper program is 3 billion  

if market conditions were to change and our revenue was reduced significantly or operating costs were to increase our cash flows and liquidity could be reduced additionally it could cause the rating agencies to lower our credit rating there are no ratings triggers that would accelerate the maturity of any borrowings under our committed credit facility however a downgrade in our credit ratings could increase the cost of borrowings under the credit facility and could also limit or preclude our ability to issue commercial paper should this occur we could seek alternative sources of funding including borrowing under the credit facility 

cash requirements 

in 2018  we believe cash on hand cash flows from operating activities the available debt shelf registration and the 2017 credit agreement will provide us with sufficient capital resources and liquidity to manage our working capital needs meet contractual obligations fund capital expenditures and dividends and support the development of our shortterm and longterm operating strategies if necessary we may issue commercial paper or other shortterm debt to fund cash needs in the us in excess of the cash generated in the us 

our capital expenditures can be adjusted and managed by us to match market demand and activity levels in light of the current market conditions capital expenditures in 2018 will be made as appropriate at a rate that we estimate would equal up to 5 of annual revenue the expenditures are expected to be used primarily for normal recurring items necessary to support our business we also anticipate making income tax payments in the range of 325 million to 375 million in 2018  

bhge 2017 form 10k  38 

contractual obligations 

in the table below we set forth our contractual obligations as of december 31 2017  certain amounts included in this table are based on our estimates and assumptions about these obligations including their duration anticipated actions by third parties and other factors the contractual obligations we will actually pay in future periods may vary from those reflected in the table because the estimates and assumptions are subjective 



 

due to the uncertainty with respect to the timing of potential future cash outflows associated with our uncertain tax positions we are unable to make reasonable estimates of the period of cash settlement if any to the respective taxing authorities therefore 543 million  in uncertain tax positions including interest and penalties have been excluded from the contractual obligations table above see note 10 income taxes of the notes to consolidated and combined financial statements in item 8 herein for further information 

we have certain defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans covering certain of our us and international employees during 2017 we made contributions and paid direct benefits of approximately 63 million  in connection with those plans and we anticipate funding approximately 68 million  during 2018 amounts for pension funding obligations are based on assumptions that are subject to change therefore we are currently not able to reasonably estimate our contribution figures after 2018 see note 9 employee benefit plans of the notes to consolidated and combined financial statements in item 8 herein for further information 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

in the normal course of business with customers vendors and others we have entered into offbalance sheet arrangements such as surety bonds for performance letters of credit and other bank issued guarantees which totaled approximately 34 billion at december 31 2017  it is not practicable to estimate the fair value of these financial instruments none of the offbalance sheet arrangements either has or is likely to have a material effect on our consolidated and combined financial statements 

as of december 31 2017  we had no material offbalance sheet financing arrangements other than normal operating leases as discussed above as such we are not materially exposed to any financing liquidity market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in such financing arrangements 

bhge 2017 form 10k  39 

other factors affecting liquidity 

customer receivables    in line with industry practice we may bill our customers for services provided in arrears dependent upon contractual terms in a challenging economic environment we may experience delays in the payment of our invoices due to customers lower cash flow from operations or their more limited access to credit markets while historically there have not been material nonpayment events we attempt to mitigate this risk through working with our customers to restructure their debts a customers failure or delay in payment could have a material adverse effect on our shortterm liquidity and results from operations as of december 31 2017 20 of our gross trade receivables were from customers in the united states other than the united states no other country or single customer accounted for more than 10 of our gross trade receivables at this date as of december 31 2016 13 of our gross trade receivables were from customers in the united states 

venezuela  oil production is considered important to the venezuelan economy therefore we intend to continue to provide services to our primary customer in this country however we are required to assess the ability of the customer to make timely payments on amounts owed to us this assessment is performed on a quarterly basis with the business relying on a variety of data sources to assess the collectability of outstanding receivables and recoverability of other assets supporting this customer we noted that there are recent market indicators such as a decline in bond prices and several delayed payments on various bond obligations that indicate that the customer’s financial condition may have worsened in the last three months we continue to actively manage our relationship with this customer as they transition through a difficult period with ongoing dialogue between key executives of both companies including discussions regarding this customers ability and intent to ultimately settle our trade receivables 

in performing our analysis of customerspecific assets as of december 31 2017 we considered that our outstanding receivables do not have the same priority as certain of the customer’s other obligations we have concluded that it may take an extended period of time to ultimately collect our outstanding receivables accordingly we have recorded an increase to our allowance for doubtful accounts of 55 million in the three months ended december 31 2017 to fully offset our remaining exposure to trade receivables and other assets from this customer in addition since future receivables generated as a result of our ongoing contracts will have the same priority as our existing receivables when issued the business has concluded that an allowance amounting to 32 million to reduce inventory that has been purchased for these contracts and that is not redeployable to fulfill other customer contracts to its lower of cost or net realizable value is warranted we will update our analysis on a quarterly basis to the extent that our outstanding receivables are settled or the likelihood of settling our outstanding receivables in the near term improves we will reverse our existing provision for doubtful accounts which would result in an income during the period of reversal 

international operations    our cash that is held outside the us is 46 of the total cash balance as of december 31 2017 we may not be able to use this cash quickly and efficiently due to exchange or cash controls that could make it challenging as a result our cash balance may not represent our ability to quickly and efficiently use this cash 

critical accounting estimates 

accounting estimates and assumptions discussed in this section are those considered to be the most critical to an understanding of our financial statements because they involve significant judgments and uncertainties many of these estimates include determining fair value these estimates reflect our best judgment about current and for some estimates future economic and market conditions and their potential effects based on information available as of the date of these financial statements if these conditions change from those expected it is reasonably possible that the judgments and estimates described below could change which may result in future impairments of goodwill intangibles and longlived assets increases in reserves for contingencies establishment of valuation allowances on deferred tax assets and increased tax liabilities among other effects also see note 1 summary of significant accounting policies of the notes to consolidated and combined financial statements in item 8 herein which discusses our most significant accounting policies 

we have defined a critical accounting estimate as one that is both important to the portrayal of either our financial condition or results of operations and requires us to make difficult subjective or complex judgments or estimates about matters that are uncertain the audit committee of our board of directors has reviewed our critical 

bhge 2017 form 10k  40 

accounting estimates and the disclosure presented below during the past three fiscal years we have not made any material changes in the methodology used to establish the critical accounting estimates and we believe that the following are the critical accounting estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated and combined financial statements there are other items within our consolidated and combined financial statements that require estimation and judgment but they are not deemed critical as defined above 

revenue recognition on longterm product services agreements 

we have longterm service agreements with our customers predominately within our tps segment these agreements typically require us to maintain assets sold to the customer over a defined contract term these agreements have average contract terms of 15 years from time to time these contract terms may be extended through contract modifications or amendments which may result in revisions to future billing and cost estimates 

we recognize revenue as we incur costs to perform under the arrangements at the estimated margin rate of the contract revenue recognition on longterm product services agreements requires estimates of both customer payments and the costs to perform required maintenance services over the contract term 

to develop our billings estimates we consider the number of billable events that will occur based on estimated utilization of the asset under contract over the life of the contract term this estimated utilization will consider both historical and market conditions asset retirements and new product introductions if applicable 

to develop our cost estimates we consider the timing and extent of maintenance and overhaul events including the amount and cost of labor spare parts and other resources required to perform the services in developing our cost estimates we utilize a combination of our historical cost experience and expected cost improvements cost improvements are only included in future cost estimates after savings have been observed in actual results or proven effective through an extensive regulatory or engineering approval process 

we routinely review the estimates used in our product services agreements and regularly revise them to adjust for changes these revisions are based on objectively verifiable information that is available at the time of the review 

the difference between the timing of our revenue recognition and cash received from our customers results in either a contract asset revenue in excess of billings or a contract liability billings in excess of revenue as of december 31 2017 and 2016 we recorded a contract asset of 1410 million  and 1046 million  and contract liability of 83 million and 103 million respectively 

we regularly assess customer credit risk inherent in the carrying amounts of receivables and contract assets and estimated earnings including the risk that contractual penalties may not be sufficient to offset our accumulated investment in the event of customer termination we gain insight into expected future utilization and cost trends as well as credit risk through our knowledge of the equipment installed and the close interaction with our customers through supplying critical services and parts over extended periods revisions to cost or billing estimates may affect a product services agreement’s total estimated profitability resulting in an adjustment of earnings such adjustments generated earnings of 344 million 293 million and 256 million for each of the years ended december 31 2017 2016 and 2015 respectively we provide for probable losses when they become evident 

we continue to evaluate the provisions of asc no 606 revenue from contracts with customers and the assessment of the impact on our consolidated and combined financial statements and related disclosures also see note 1 summary of significant accounting policies of the notes to consolidated and combined financial statements in item 8 herein for additional information and disclosure 

goodwill and other identified intangible assets 

we test goodwill for impairment annually using data as of july 1 of that year the impairment test consists of two different steps in step one the carrying value of the reporting unit is compared with its fair value in step two which is applied only when the carrying value is more than its fair value the amount of goodwill impairment if any is derived by deducting the fair value of the reporting unit’s assets and liabilities from the fair value of its equity and comparing that amount with the carrying amount of goodwill we determine fair values of each of the reporting units 

bhge 2017 form 10k  41 

using the market approach when available and appropriate or the income approach or a combination of both we assess the valuation methodology based upon the relevance and availability of the data at the time the valuation is performed 

pension assumptions 

pension benefits are calculated using significant inputs to the actuarial models that measure pension benefit obligations and related effects on operations two assumptions discount rate and expected return on assets are important elements of plan expense and assetliability measurement we evaluate these critical assumptions at least annually on a plan and country specific basis we periodically evaluate other assumptions involving demographic factors such as retirement age mortality and turnover and update them to reflect its experience and expectations for the future actual results in any given year will often differ from actuarial assumptions because of economic and other factors 

projected benefit obligations are measured as the present value of expected payments discounted using the weighted average of market observed yields for high quality fixed income securities with maturities that correspond to the payment of benefits lower discount rates increase present values and subsequent year pension expense and higher discount rates decrease present values and subsequent year pension expense the discount rates used to determine the benefit obligations for our principal pension plans at december 31 2017 2016 and 2015 were 299  341  and 383 respectively reflecting market interest rates our expected return on assets at december 31 2017 2016 and 2015 were 626  686  and 691  respectively 

income taxes 

we operate in more than 120 countries and our effective tax rate is based on our income statutory tax rates and differences between tax laws and the us generally accepted accounting principles gaap in these various jurisdictions tax laws are complex and subject to different interpretations by the taxpayer and respective governmental taxing authorities our income tax rate is significantly affected by the tax rate on our global operations in addition to local country tax laws and regulations this rate depends on the extent earnings are indefinitely reinvested outside the us historically us taxes were due upon repatriation of foreign earnings due to the enactment of us tax reform repatriations of foreign earnings will generally be free of us federal tax but may incur other taxes such as withholding or state taxes indefinite reinvestment is determined by management’s judgment about and intentions concerning the future operations of the company most of these earnings have been reinvested in active nonus business operations at december 31 2017 we have not changed our indefinite reinvestment decision as a result of us tax reform but will reassess this during the course of 2018 at december 31 2017 approximately 80 billion of earnings have been indefinitely reinvested outside the us these additional foreign earnings could become subject to additional tax if remitted or deemed remitted as a dividend computation of the potential deferred tax liability associated with these undistributed earnings and any other basis differences is not practicable 

deferred income tax assets represent amounts available to reduce income taxes payable in future years we evaluate the recoverability of these future tax deductions and credits by assessing the adequacy of future taxable income from all sources including reversal of taxable temporary differences forecasted operating earnings and available tax planning strategies these sources of income rely heavily on estimates we use our historical experience and short and long range business forecasts to provide insight we record a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 

on december 22 2017 the us enacted the tax cuts and jobs act us tax reform that lowers the statutory tax rate on us earnings taxes historic foreign earnings previously deferred from us taxation at a reduced rate of tax transition tax establishes a territorial tax system and enacts new taxes associated with global operations 

the impact of us tax reform has been recorded on a provisional basis as the legislation provides for additional guidance to be issued by the us department of the treasury on several provisions including the computation of the transition tax guidance in 2018 could impact the information required for and the calculation of the transition tax charge and could affect decisions that affect the tax on various us and foreign items which would further impact the final amounts included in the transition tax charge and impact the revaluation of deferred taxes in addition 

bhge 2017 form 10k  42 

analysis performed and conclusions reached as part of the tax return filing process and additional guidance on accounting for tax reform could affect the provisional amount 

additionally as part of us tax reform the us has enacted a tax on base eroding payments from the us and a minimum tax on foreign earnings global intangible lowtaxed income because aspects of the new minimum tax and the effect on our operations is uncertain and because aspects of the accounting rules associated with this provision have not been resolved we have not made a provisional accrual for the deferred tax aspects of this provision and consequently have not made an accounting policy election on the deferred tax treatment of this tax 

our tax filings routinely are subject to audit by the tax authorities in the jurisdictions where we conduct business these audits may result in assessments of additional taxes that are resolved with the tax authorities or through the courts we have provided for the amounts we believe will ultimately result from these proceedings but settlements of issues raised in these audits may affect our tax rate we have 395 million of gross unrecognized tax benefits excluding interest and penalties at december 31 2017 we are not able to reasonably estimate in which future periods these amounts ultimately will be settled 

other loss contingencies 

other loss contingencies are uncertain and unresolved matters that arise in the ordinary course of business and result from events or actions by others that have the potential to result in a future loss such contingencies include but are not limited to environmental obligations litigation regulatory proceedings product quality and losses resulting from other events and developments 

the preparation of our consolidated and combined financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenue and expenses and related disclosures as well as disclosures about any contingent assets and liabilities we base these estimates and judgments on historical experience and other assumptions and information that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances estimates and assumptions about future events and their effects are subject to uncertainty and accordingly these estimates may change as new events occur as more experience is acquired as additional information is obtained and as the business environment in which we operate changes 

allowance for doubtful accounts 

the determination of the collectability of amounts due from our customers requires us to make judgments and estimates regarding our customers ability to pay amounts due us in order to determine the amount of valuation allowances required for doubtful accounts we monitor our customers payment history and current credit worthiness to determine that collectability is reasonably assured we also consider the overall business climate in which our customers operate provisions for doubtful accounts are recorded based on the aging status of the customer accounts or when it becomes evident that the customer will not make the required payments at either contractual due dates or in the future at december 31 2017  and 2016  the allowance for doubtful accounts totaled 330 million  and 186 million  of total gross accounts receivable respectively we believe that our allowance for doubtful accounts is adequate to cover potential bad debt losses under current conditions however uncertainties regarding changes in the financial condition of our customers either adverse or positive could impact the amount and timing of any additional provisions for doubtful accounts that may be required 

inventory reserves 

inventory is a significant component of current assets and is stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value this requires us to record provisions and maintain reserves for excess slow moving and obsolete inventory to determine these reserve amounts we regularly review inventory quantities on hand and compare them to estimates of future product demand market conditions production requirements and technological developments these estimates and forecasts inherently include uncertainties and require us to make judgments regarding potential future outcomes at december 31 2017  and 2016  inventory reserves totaled 360 million  and 260 million  of gross inventory respectively we believe that our reserves are adequate to properly value potential excess slow moving and obsolete inventory under current conditions significant or unanticipated changes to our estimates and forecasts could impact the amount and timing of any additional provisions for excess slow moving or obsolete inventory that may be required

acquisitionspurchase price allocation 

we allocate the purchase price of an acquired business to its identifiable assets and liabilities based on estimated fair values the excess of the purchase price over the amount allocated to the assets and liabilities if any is recorded as goodwill we use all available information to estimate fair values including quoted market prices the carrying value of acquired assets and widely accepted valuation techniques such as discounted cash flows we engage thirdparty appraisal firms to assist in fair value determination of inventories identifiable intangible assets and any other significant assets or liabilities when appropriate the judgments made in determining the estimated fair value assigned to each class of assets acquired and liabilities assumed as well as asset lives can materially impact our results of operations

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we are exposed to certain market risks that are inherent in our financial instruments and arise from changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates we may enter into derivative financial instrument transactions to manage or reduce market risk but do not enter into derivative financial instrument transactions for speculative purposes a discussion of our primary market risk exposure in financial instruments is presented below 

interest rate risk 

the majority of our debt is comprised of fixed rate instruments we are subject to interest rate risk on our debt and investment portfolio we may use interest rate swaps to manage the economic effect of fixed rate obligations associated with certain debt there were no outstanding interest rate swap agreements as of december 31 2017  the following table sets forth our fixed rate longterm debt excluding capital leases and the related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates 





bhge 2017 form 10k  45 

foreign currency exchange risk 

we conduct our operations around the world in a number of different currencies and we are exposed to market risks resulting from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates many of our significant foreign subsidiaries have designated the local currency as their functional currency as such future earnings are subject to change due to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates when transactions are denominated in currencies other than our functional currencies 

additionally we buy manufacture and sell components and products across global markets these activities expose us to changes in foreign currency exchange rates commodity prices and interest rates which can adversely affect revenue earned and costs of our operating businesses when the currency in which equipment is sold differs from the primary currency of the legal entity and the exchange rate fluctuates it will affect the revenue earned on the sale these sales and purchase transactions also create receivables and payables denominated in foreign currencies and exposure to foreign currency gains and losses based on changes in exchange rates changes in the price of raw materials used in manufacturing can affect the cost of manufacturing we use derivatives to mitigate or eliminate these exposures where appropriate 

we use cash flow hedging primarily to reduce or eliminate the effects of foreign currency exchange rate changes on purchase and sale contracts accordingly most derivative activity in this category consists of currency exchange contracts we had outstanding foreign currency forward contracts with net notional amounts aggregating 33 billion  and 06 billion  to hedge exposure to currency fluctuations in various foreign currencies at december 31 2017  and 2016 respectively as of december 31 2017 the company estimates that a 1 appreciation or depreciation in the us dollar would result in an impact of approximately 10 million to our pretax earnings however the company is generally able to mitigate its foreign exchange exposure where there are liquid financial markets through use of foreign currency derivative transactions also see note 14 financial instruments of the notes to consolidated and combined financial statements in item 8 herein which has additional details on our strategy
