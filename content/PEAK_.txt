general overview 



healthpeak properties inc is a standard  poor’s “sp” 500 company that acquires develops owns leases and manages healthcare real estate across the united states “us” our company was originally founded in 1985 we are a maryland corporation and qualify as a selfadministered reit our corporate headquarters are located in denver colorado and we have additional offices in irvine california and franklin tennessee 

during 2020 we began the process of disposing of our senior housing triplenet and senior housing operating property “shop” portfolios in september 2021 we successfully completed the disposition of both portfolios refer to the discussion of recent dispositions in “item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations—overview of transactions” for additional information as of december 31 2020 we concluded that the planned dispositions represented a strategic shift that had and will have a major effect on our operations and financial results and therefore the assets are classified as discontinued operations in all periods presented herein see note 5 to the consolidated financial statements for further information regarding discontinued operations 

in conjunction with the disposal of our senior housing triplenet and shop portfolios we focused our strategy on investing in a diversified portfolio of highquality healthcare properties across our three core asset classes of life science medical office and continuing care retirement community “ccrc” real estate under the life science and medical office segments we invest through the acquisition development and management of life science buildings mobs and hospitals under the ccrc segment our properties are operated through ridea structures we have other nonreportable segments that are comprised primarily of debt investments and an interest in an unconsolidated joint venture that owns 19 senior housing assets our “swf sh jv” 

at december 31 2021 our portfolio of investments including properties in our unconsolidated joint ventures consisted of interests in 484 properties the following table summarizes information for our reportable segments excluding discontinued operations for the year ended december 31 2021 dollars in thousands

business strategy 



we invest in and manage our real estate portfolio for the longterm to maximize benefit to our stockholders and support the growth of our dividends our strategy consists of four core elements 

i our real estate  our portfolio is grounded in highquality properties in desirable locations we focus on three purposely selected private pay asset classes—life science medical office and continuing care retirement community—to provide stability through inevitable market cycles 

ii our financials  we maintain a strong investmentgrade balance sheet with ample liquidity as well as longterm fixedrate debt financing with staggered maturities to reduce our exposure to interest rate volatility and refinancing risk 

iii our partnerships  we work with leading healthcare companies operators and service providers and are responsive to their space and capital needs we provide highquality property management services to encourage tenants to renew expand and relocate into our properties which drives increased occupancy rental rates and property values 

iv our platform  we have a peoplefirst culture that we believe attracts develops and retains top talent we continually strive to create and maintain an industryleading platform with systems and tools that allow us to effectively and efficiently manage our assets and investment activity 

internal growth strategies 

we believe our real estate portfolio holds the potential for increased future cash flows as it is wellmaintained and in desirable locations our strategy for maximizing the benefits from these opportunities is to i work with new or existing tenants and operators to address their space and capital needs and ii provide highquality property management services in order to motivate tenants to renew expand or relocate into our properties 

we expect to continue our internal growth as a result of our ability to 

• build and maintain longterm leasing and management relationships with quality tenants and operators in choosing locations for our properties we focus on the physical environment adjacency to established businesses eg hospital systems and educational centers proximity to sources of business growth and other local demographic factors 

• replace tenants and operators at the best available market terms and lowest possible transaction costs we believe we are wellpositioned to attract new tenants and operators and achieve attractive rental rates and operating cash flow as a result of the location design and maintenance of our properties together with our reputation for highquality building services and responsiveness to tenants and our ability to offer space alternatives within our portfolio 

• extend and modify terms of existing leases prior to expiration we structure lease extensions early renewals or modifications which reduce the cost associated with lease downtime or the reinvestment risk resulting from the exercise of tenants’ purchase options while securing the tenancy and relationship of our high quality tenants and operators on a longterm basis 

investment strategies 

the delivery of healthcare services requires real estate and as a result tenants and operators depend on real estate in part to maintain and grow their businesses we believe the healthcare real estate market provides investment opportunities due to the i compelling longterm demographics driving the demand for healthcare services ii specialized nature of healthcare real estate investing and iii ongoing consolidation of the fragmented healthcare real estate sector 

while we emphasize healthcare real estate ownership we may also provide real estate secured financing to or invest in equity or debt securities of healthcare operators or other entities engaged in healthcare real estate ownership we may also acquire all or substantially all of the securities or assets of other reits operating companies or similar entities where such investments would be consistent with our investment strategies we may coinvest alongside institutional or development investors through partnerships or limited liability companies 

we monitor but do not limit our investments based on the percentage of our total assets that may be invested in any one property type investment vehicle or geographic location the number of properties that may be leased to a single tenant or operator or loans that may be made to a single borrower in allocating capital we target opportunities with the most attractive riskreward profile for our portfolio as a whole we may take additional measures to mitigate risk including diversifying our investments by sector geography tenant or operator structuring transactions as master leases requiring tenant or operator insurance and indemnifications andor obtaining credit enhancements in the form of guarantees letters of credit or security deposits 

we believe we are wellpositioned to achieve external growth through acquisitions financing and development other factors that contribute to our competitive position include 

• our reputation gained through over 35 years of successful operations and the strength of our existing portfolio of properties 

• our relationships with leading healthcare operators and systems investment banks and other market intermediaries corporations private equity firms notforprofit organizations and public institutions seeking to monetize existing assets or develop new facilities 

• our relationships with institutional buyers and sellers of highquality healthcare real estate 

• our track record and reputation for executing acquisitions responsively and efficiently which provides confidence to domestic and foreign institutions and private investors who seek to sell healthcare real estate in our market areas 

• our relationships with nationally recognized financial institutions that provide capital to the healthcare and real estate industries and 

• our control of sites including assets under contract with radius restrictions 

financing strategies 

our reit qualification requires us to distribute at least 90 of our reit taxable income excluding net capital gains therefore we do not retain a significant amount of earnings as a result we regularly access the public equity and debt markets to raise the funds necessary to finance acquisitions and debt investments develop and redevelop properties and refinance maturing debt 

we may finance acquisitions and other investments primarily through the following vehicles 

• cash flow from operations 

• sale or exchange of ownership interests in properties or other investments 

• borrowings under our credit facility or commercial paper program 

• issuance of additional debt including unsecured notes term loans and mortgage debt andor 

• issuance of common stock or preferred stock or its equivalent 

we maintain a disciplined investmentgrade balance sheet by actively managing our debt to equity levels and maintaining access to multiple sources of liquidity our debt obligations are primarily longterm fixed rate with staggered maturities 

we finance our investments based on our evaluation of available sources of funding for shortterm purposes we may utilize our revolving line of credit facility or commercial paper program arrange for other shortterm borrowings from banks or other sources or issue equity securities pursuant to our atthemarket equity offering program we arrange for longerterm financing by offering debt and equity placing mortgage debt and obtaining capital from institutional lenders and joint venture partners 

segments 



life science 

our life science properties which contain laboratory and office space are leased primarily to biotechnology medical device and pharmaceutical companies scientific research institutions government agencies and other organizations involved in the life science industry while these properties have characteristics similar to commercial office buildings they generally contain more advanced electrical mechanical heating ventilating and air conditioning systems the facilities generally have specialty equipment including emergency generators fume hoods lab bench tops and related amenities in addition to improvements funded by us as the landlord many of our life science tenants make significant investments to improve their leased space to accommodate biology chemistry or medical device research initiatives 

life science properties are primarily configured in business park or campus settings and include multiple buildings the business park and campus settings allow us the opportunity to provide flexible contiguousadjacent expansion to accommodate the growth of existing tenants our properties are located in wellestablished geographical markets known for scientific research and drug discovery including san francisco 49 and san diego 22 california and boston massachusetts 24 based on available square feet at december 31 2021 88 of our life science properties were triplenet leased based on leased square feet 

the following table provides information about our most significant life science tenant concentration for the year ended december 31 2021 



medical office 

our medical office segment includes medical office buildings mobs and hospitals mobs typically contain physicians’ offices and examination rooms and may also include pharmacies hospital ancillary service space and outpatient services such as diagnostic centers rehabilitation clinics and daysurgery operating rooms while these facilities are similar to commercial office buildings they require additional plumbing electrical and mechanical systems to accommodate multiple exam rooms that may require sinks in every room and special equipment such as xray machines in addition mobs are often built to accommodate higher structural loads for certain equipment and may contain vaults or other specialized construction our mobs are typically multitenant properties leased to healthcare providers hospitals and physician practices with approximately 87 of our mobs located on or adjacent to hospital campuses and 98 affiliated with hospital systems as of december 31 2021 based on available square feet occasionally we invest in mobs located on hospital campuses subject to ground leases at december 31 2021 approximately 65 of our mobs were net leased based on leased square feet with the remaining leased under gross or modified gross leases 

the following table provides information about our most significant medical office tenant concentration for the year ended december 31 2021 



our medical office segment also includes nine hospitals services provided by our tenants and operators in hospitals are paid for by private sources thirdparty payors eg insurance and hmos or through medicare and medicaid programs our hospital property types include acute care longterm acute care and specialty and rehabilitation hospitals all of our hospitals are triplenet leased 

continuing care retirement community or ccrc 

ccrcs are retirement communities that include independent living assisted living and skilled nursing units to provide a continuum of care in an integrated campus our ccrcs are owned through ridea structures which is permitted by the housing and economic recovery act of 2008 and includes most of the provisions previously proposed in the reit investment diversification and empowerment act of 2007 commonly referred to as “ridea” the services provided by our thirdparty manageroperators under a ridea structure at our properties are primarily paid for by the residents directly or through private insurance and are less reliant on government reimbursement programs such as medicare and medicaid 

a ridea structure allows us through a taxable reit subsidiary “trs” to receive cash flow from the operations of a healthcare facility in compliance with reit tax requirements the criteria for operating a healthcare facility through a ridea structure require us to lease the facility to an affiliate trs and for such affiliate trs to engage an independent qualifying management company also known as an eligible independent contractor or thirdparty operator to manage and operate the daytoday business of the facility in exchange for a management fee as a result under a ridea structure we are required to rely on a thirdparty operator to hire and train all facility employees enter into thirdparty contracts for the benefit of the facility including residentpatient agreements comply with laws including healthcare laws and provide resident care we are substantially limited in our ability to control or influence daytoday operations under a ridea structure and thus rely on the thirdparty operator to manage and operate the business 

through our trs entities we bear all operational risks and liabilities associated with the operation of these properties with limited exceptions such as a thirdparty operator’s gross negligence or willful misconduct these operational risks and liabilities include those relating to any employment matters of our operator compliance with healthcare and other laws liabilities relating to personal injurytort matters residentpatient quality of care claims and any governmental reimbursement matters even though we have limited ability to control or influence our thirdparty operators’ management of these risks 

the management agreements we have in ridea structures related to ccrcs have original terms ranging from 10 to 15 years with mutual renewal options there are base management fees and incentive management fees payable to our thirdparty operators if operating results of the ridea properties exceed preestablished thresholds conversely there are also provisions in the management agreements that reduce management fees payable to our thirdparty operators if operating results do not meet certain preestablished thresholds 

ccrcs are different from other housing and care options for seniors because they typically provide written agreements or longterm contracts between residents and the communities frequently lasting the term of the resident’s lifetime which offer a continuum of housing services and healthcare on one campus or site ccrcs are appealing as they allow residents to “age in place” and typically require the individual to be independent and in relatively good health upon entry 

as thirdparty operators manage our ridea properties in exchange for the receipt of a management fee we are not directly exposed to the credit risk of these operators in the same manner or to the same extent as a triplenet tenant 

other nonreportable segment 

at december 31 2021 we had the following investments in our other nonreportable segments i our unconsolidated joint venture with a sovereign wealth fund that owns 19 senior housing assets which we refer to as our swf sh jv and ii debt investments 

the properties in our swf sh jv are owned through ridea structures and include independent living facilities and assisted living facilities which cater to different segments of the elderly population based upon their personal needs these facilities are often in apartmentlike buildings with private residences ranging from single rooms to large apartments 

competition 



investing in real estate serving the healthcare industry is highly competitive we face competition from other reits investment companies pension funds private equity investors sovereign funds healthcare operators lenders developers and other institutional investors some of whom may have greater flexibility eg nonreit competitors greater resources and lower costs of capital than we do increased competition and resulting capitalization rate compression make it more challenging for us to identify and successfully capitalize on opportunities that meet our objectives our ability to compete may also be impacted by global national and local economic trends availability of investment alternatives availability and cost of capital construction and renovation costs existing laws and regulations new legislation and population trends 

income from our investments depends on our tenants’ and operators’ ability to compete with other companies on multiple levels including i the quality of care provided ii reputation iii success of product or drug development iv price v the range of services offered vi the physical appearance of a facility vii alternatives for healthcare delivery viii the supply of competing properties ix physicians x staff xi referral sources xii location xiii the size and demographics of the population in surrounding areas and xiv the financial condition of our tenants and operators for a discussion of the risks associated with competitive conditions affecting our business see “item 1a risk factors” in this report 

government regulation licensing and enforcement 



overview 

our healthcare facility operators which include our trs entities when we use a ridea structure and tenants are subject to extensive and complex federal state and local healthcare laws and regulations relating to quality of care licensure and certificate of need government reimbursement fraud and abuse practices and similar laws governing the operation of healthcare facilities and we expect the healthcare industry in general will continue to face increased regulation and pressure in the areas of fraud waste and abuse cost control healthcare management and provision of services among others these regulations are wide ranging and can subject our tenants and operators to civil criminal and administrative sanctions affected tenants and operators may find it increasingly difficult to comply with this complex and evolving regulatory environment because of a relative lack of guidance in many areas as certain of our healthcare properties are subject to oversight from several government agencies and the laws may vary from one jurisdiction to another changes in laws regulations reimbursement enforcement activity and regulatory noncompliance by our tenants and operators can all have a significant effect on their operations and financial condition which in turn may adversely impact us as detailed below and set forth under “item 1a risk factors” in this report 

the following is a discussion of certain laws and regulations generally applicable to our operators and in certain cases to us 

fraud and abuse enforcement 

there are various extremely complex us federal and state laws and regulations governing healthcare providers’ relationships and arrangements and prohibiting fraudulent and abusive practices by such providers these laws include i us federal and state false claims acts which among other things prohibit providers from filing false claims or making false statements to receive payment from medicare medicaid or other us federal or state healthcare programs ii us federal and state antikickback and feesplitting statutes including the medicare and medicaid antikickback statute which prohibit or restrict the payment or receipt of remuneration to induce referrals or recommendations of healthcare items or services iii us federal and state physician selfreferral laws commonly referred to as the “stark law” which generally prohibit referrals by physicians to entities with which the physician or an immediate family member has a financial relationship and iv the federal civil monetary penalties law which prohibits among other things the knowing presentation of a false or fraudulent claim for certain healthcare services violations of us healthcare fraud and abuse laws carry civil criminal and administrative sanctions including punitive sanctions monetary penalties imprisonment denial of medicare and medicaid reimbursement and potential exclusion from medicare medicaid or other federal or state healthcare programs these laws are enforced by a variety of federal state and local agencies and in the us can also be enforced by private litigants through among other things federal and state false claims acts which allow private litigants to bring qui tam or “whistleblower” actions our tenants and operators that participate in government reimbursement programs are subject to these laws and may become the subject of governmental enforcement actions or whistleblower actions if they fail to comply with applicable laws additionally the licensed operators of our us longterm care facilities that participate in government reimbursement programs are required to have compliance and ethics programs that meet the requirements of federal laws and regulations relating to the social security act where we have used a ridea structure we are dependent on management companies to fulfill our compliance obligations and we have developed a program to periodically monitor compliance with such obligations 

laws and regulations governing privacy and security 

there are various us federal and state privacy laws and regulations including the privacy and security rules contained in the health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 commonly referred to as “hipaa” that provide for the privacy and security of personal health information an increasing focus of the u s federal trade commission’s “ftc’s” consumer protection regulation is the impact of technological change on protection of consumer privacy the ftc as well as state attorneys general have taken enforcement action against companies that do not abide by their representations to consumers regarding electronic security and privacy to the extent we or our affiliated operating entities are a covered entity or business associate under hipaa and the health information technology for economic and clinical health act the “hitech act” compliance with those requirements require us to among other things conduct a risk analysis implement a risk management plan implement policies and procedures and conduct employee training in most cases we are dependent on our tenants and management companies to fulfill our compliance obligations and we have developed a program to periodically monitor compliance with such obligations because of the far reaching nature of these laws there can be no assurance we would not be required to alter one or more of our systems and data security procedures to be in compliance with these laws our failure to protect health information could subject us to civil or criminal liability and adverse publicity and could harm our business and impair our ability to attract new customers and residents we may be required to notify individuals as well as government agencies and the media if we experience a data breach 

reimbursement 

sources of revenue for some of our tenants and operators include among others governmental healthcare programs such as the federal medicare programs and state medicaid programs and nongovernmental thirdparty payors such as insurance carriers and hmos as federal and state governments focus on healthcare reform initiatives and as the federal government and many states face significant current and future budget deficits efforts to reduce costs by these payors will likely continue which may result in reduced or slower growth in reimbursement for certain services provided by some of our tenants and operators additionally new and evolving payor and provider programs in the us including medicare advantage dual eligible accountable care organizations and bundled payments could adversely impact our tenants’ and operators’ liquidity financial condition or results of operations 

healthcare licensure and certificate of need 

certain healthcare facilities in our portfolio are subject to extensive national federal state and local licensure certification and inspection laws and regulations a healthcare facility’s failure to comply with these laws and regulations could result in a revocation suspension restriction or nonrenewal of the facility’s license and loss of a certificate of need which could adversely affect the facility’s operations and ability to bill for items and services provided at the facility in addition various licenses and permits are required to handle controlled substances including narcotics operate pharmacies handle radioactive materials and operate equipment many states in the us require certain healthcare providers to obtain a certificate of need which requires prior approval for the construction expansion or closure of certain healthcare facilities the approval process related to state certificate of need laws may impact the ability of some of our tenants and operators to expand or change their businesses 

product approvals 

while our life science tenants include some wellestablished companies other tenants are less established and in some cases may not yet have a product approved by the food and drug administration or other regulatory authorities for commercial sale creating a new pharmaceutical product or medical device requires substantial investments of time and capital in part because of the extensive regulation of the healthcare industry it also entails considerable risk of failure in demonstrating that the product is safe and effective and in gaining regulatory approval and market acceptance 

entrance fee communities 

our ccrcs are operated as entrance fee communities generally an entrance fee is an upfront fee or consideration paid by a resident a portion of which may be refundable in exchange for some form of longterm benefit typically consisting of a right to receive certain personal or health care services in certain states including the ones in which we operate entrance fee communities are subject to significant state regulatory oversight including for example oversight of each facility’s financial condition establishment and monitoring of reserve requirements and other financial restrictions the right of residents to cancel their contracts within a specified period of time the right of residents to receive a refund of their entrance fees lien rights in favor of the residents restrictions on change of ownership and similar matters 

americans with disabilities act “ada” 

our properties must comply with the ada and any similar state or local laws to the extent that such properties are “public accommodations” as defined in those statutes the ada may require removal of barriers to access by persons with disabilities in certain public areas of our properties where such removal is readily achievable to date we have not received any notices of noncompliance with the ada that have caused us to incur substantial capital expenditures to address ada concerns should barriers to access by persons with disabilities be discovered at any of our properties we may be directly or indirectly responsible for additional costs that may be required to make facilities adacompliant noncompliance with the ada could result in the imposition of fines or an award of damages to private litigants the obligation to make readily achievable accommodations pursuant to the ada is an ongoing one and we continue to assess our properties and make modifications as appropriate in this respect 

environmental matters 

a wide variety of federal state and local environmental and occupational health and safety laws and regulations affect healthcare facility operations these complex federal and state statutes and their enforcement involve a myriad of regulations many of which involve strict liability on the part of the potential offender some of these federal and state statutes may directly impact us under various federal state and local environmental laws ordinances and regulations an owner of real property or a secured lender such as us may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of hazardous or toxic substances at under or disposed of in connection with such property as well as other potential costs relating to hazardous or toxic substances including government fines and damages for injuries to persons and adjacent property the cost of any required remediation removal fines or personal or property damages and any related liability therefore could exceed or impair the value of the property andor the assets in addition the presence of such substances or the failure to properly dispose of or remediate such substances may adversely affect the value of such property and the owner’s ability to sell or rent such property or to borrow using such property as collateral which in turn could reduce our earnings for a description of the risks associated with environmental matters see “item 1a risk factors” in this report 

insurance 



we obtain various types of insurance to mitigate the impact of property business interruption liability flood windstorm earthquake fire environmental and terrorismrelated losses we attempt to obtain appropriate policy terms conditions limits and deductibles considering the relative risk of loss the cost of such coverage and current industry practice there are however certain types of extraordinary losses such as those due to acts of war or other events that may be either uninsurable or not economically insurable in addition we have a large number of properties that are exposed to earthquake flood and windstorm occurrences which carry higher deductibles 

we maintain property insurance for all of our properties tenants under triplenet leases are required to provide primary property business interruption and liability insurance we maintain separate general and professional liability insurance for our shop and ccrc facilities additionally our corporate general liability insurance program also extends coverage for all of our properties beyond the aforementioned we periodically review whether we or our ridea operators will bear responsibility for maintaining the required insurance coverage for the applicable shop and ccrc properties but the costs of such insurance are facility expenses paid from the revenues of those properties regardless of who maintains the insurance 

we also maintain directors and officers liability insurance which provides protection for claims against our directors and officers arising from their responsibilities as directors and officers such insurance also extends to us in certain situations 

sustainability 



we believe that environmental social and governance “esg” initiatives are a vital part of corporate responsibility which supports our primary goal of increasing stockholder value through profitable growth we continue to advance our commitment to sustainability with a focus on achieving goals in each of the esg dimensions our nominating and corporate governance committee of the board oversees esg matters other than human capital matters that our compensation and human capital committee of the board oversees as described below

 item 1a risk factors 

the section below discusses the most significant risk factors that may materially adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

as set forth below we believe that the risks we face generally fall into the following categories 

• risks related to our business and operations 

• risks related to our capital structure and market conditions 

• risks related to the regulatory environment 

• risks related to other events 

• risks related to tax including reitrelated risks and 

• general risks 

risks related to our business and operations 



the covid pandemic and health and safety measures intended to reduce its spread have adversely affected and may continue to adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

beginning in 2020 global health concerns and efforts to reduce the spread of covid resulted in travel bans quarantines “shelterinplace” and similar orders restricting the activities of individuals outside of their homes as well as business limitations and shutdowns of businesses deemed “nonessential” although many of these restrictions have been lifted or scaled back over time ongoing resurgences of covid infections including due to new and more contagious variants have resulted in the reimposition of certain restrictions and may lead to other restrictions being reimplemented to reduce the spread of covid moreover as individuals and businesses have adapted to the regulatory and market challenges arising from the pandemic some potentially permanent changes in traditional economic patterns and arrangements have occurred for a description of certain of these changes see “item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations—covid update” as a result of these regulatory requirements and adaptations to the “new normal” the ability of our tenants operators and borrowers to conduct their normal businesses operations to operate profitably and to comply with their rent and other financial obligations to us have in some cases been or may in the future be adversely affected 

senior housing facilities have been disproportionately impacted by covid and covidrelated fatalities within our ccrc properties and the properties in our swf sh jv average occupancy declined from 856 and 887 respectively for the year ended december 31 2019 to 791 and 727 respectively for the year ended december 31 2021 recent surges in covid case levels may result in a reduction in or in some cases prohibitions on new tenant moveins stricter movein criteria lower inquiry volumes and reduced inperson tours as well as incidences of covid outbreaks at our facilities or the perception that outbreaks may occur in addition a lack of available staffing resources at our ccrc properties and the properties in our swf sh jv including due to labor shortages or outbreaks among the existing staff could result in admission restrictions or reduced demand if facilities are perceived as understaffed outbreaks which directly affect our residents and the employees at our senior housing facilities have and could continue to materially and adversely disrupt operations these outbreaks could cause significant reputational harm to us and our operators and for an extended period adversely affected demand for senior housing our senior housing property operators are also facing material cost increases as a result of higher staffing hours and compensation and higher overall levels of inflation at our ccrc facilities and the facilities in our swf sh jv we bear these material cost increases the pandemic has also delayed the deployment of capital improvements and expenditures which could adversely impact operations at our senior housing facilities our senior housing borrowers are facing the same impacts of covid which could impact their ability to meet their financial and other contractual obligations to us 

the impact of the covid pandemic on our ccrc properties and the properties owned by our swf sh jv all of which are managed in ridea structures has had and may continue to have a more significant impact on our results of operations on a relative basis because we receive cash flow from the operations of the properties as compared to receiving only contractual rent from third party tenantoperators under the senior housing triplenet portfolio that we disposed of as described above under “item 1—business—general overview” and we also bear all operational risks and liabilities associated with the operation of those properties other than those arising out of certain actions by our operator such as gross negligence or willful misconduct accordingly impacts from the covid pandemic directly affecting our ccrc properties and the properties owned by our swf sh jv including lower net operating income caused by decreased revenues that may result from declines in occupancy or otherwise and increased expenses have had and are expected to continue to have a direct and immediate impact on our results of operations in addition our ridea operators who are adversely affected by the covid pandemic may request revisions to their management agreements and existing fee structures in order to reduce the amount of cash from operations that flows directly to us we may also be directly adversely impacted by potential lawsuits related to covid outbreaks that have occurred or may occur at our senior housing and ccrc properties and our insurance coverage may not be sufficient to cover any potential losses 

in 2020 the pandemic adversely impacted certain development redevelopment and tenant improvement projects as a result of the “shelterinplace” orders and local state and federal directives although these development redevelopment and tenant improvement projects resumed in 2020 and continued as planned in 2021 with infection control protocols in place the pandemic including labor and supply chain disruptions andor other economic conditions caused by the pandemic could adversely impact the scheduled completion andor cost of these projects 

within our medical office portfolio many physician practices temporarily discontinued outpatient procedures and nonessential surgeries in 2020 due to health and safety measures which negatively impacted their cash flows at that time we implemented a deferred rent program primarily for may and june 2020 that was limited to certain nonhealth system and nonhospital tenants in good standing which resulted in reduced cash flow in the periods in which such deferrals were granted but increased our cash flow in the period in which such deferrals were repaid we did not offer any rent deferrals in 2021 but if new outbreaks or other conditions result in a similar negative impact on our tenants we may consider implementation of another deferred rent program for future periods new leasing slowed down during the governmentmandated shutdown in 2020 and returned to normal levels in 2021 new outbreaks or other conditions could result in another slowdown in new leasing in addition any reinstatement of restrictions on our tenants’ procedures and continuing restrictions on patient visitation could impact our tenants’ ability to meet their obligations to us as well as our parking income in our medical office portfolio 

the covid pandemic subjects our business and the businesses of our tenants operators and borrowers to various risks and uncertainties that have adversely affected and could materially adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition for at least the pendency of the covid pandemic and possibly longer including the following 

• material cost increases at our ccrc facilities and the facilities in our swf sh jv for which we are responsible 

• any rent deferrals or delays in rent commencement that we may grant to tenants which could result in a significant decrease in our cash receipts during the period of the deferrals 

• nonpayment of contractual obligations by our tenants or operators and any limitations on our ability to enforce our lease agreements or management agreements with our tenants or operators as applicable as a result of any federal state or local restrictions on tenant evictions for failure to make contractual rent payments which may result in higher reserves for bad debt 

• our tenants operators or borrowers becoming insolvent or initiating bankruptcy or similar proceedings which would adversely affect our ability to collect rent or interest payments from such tenants or borrowers as applicable and result in increased costs to us as well as decreased revenues 

• the complete or partial closures of or other operational issues at one or more of our properties resulting from government action or directives which may intensify the risk of rent deferrals or nonpayment of contractual obligations by our tenants operators or borrowers 

• the likelihood that we will amend existing lease agreements and existing rental terms with our tenants and management agreements and existing fee structures with our ridea operators particularly in our senior housing portfolio which would have an adverse effect on our revenues and results of operations 

• the likelihood that we will amend existing loan agreements with our senior housing borrowers which would have an adverse effect on our revenues and results of operations 

• increased costs or delays that may result if we determine to reposition or transition any of our currentlyleased properties to another tenant or operator which could adversely impact our revenues and results of operations 

• the impact on our results of operations and financial condition resulting from i delays or increased costs caused by a shortage of construction materials or labor or suspensions or delays in development and redevelopment activities and tenant improvement projects including due to local state and federal orders or guidelines delays or increased costs caused by slowdowns in construction as a result of implementing social distancing and other health and safety protocols as well as potential postponement of rent commencement dates due to delays in tenant improvement projects and ii a decrease in acquisitions and dispositions of properties compared to historical levels 

• reduced valuations for properties in our portfolio that we wish to sell and potential delayed transaction and due diligence timing due to government delays or government mandated covidrelated access restrictions 

• the need to provide seller financing in order to dispose of certain properties in our portfolio at acceptable prices 

• the impact on our tenants operators or borrowers particularly in our senior housing portfolio of lawsuits related to covid outbreaks that have occurred or may occur at our properties and the potential that insurance coverage may not be sufficient to cover any potential losses 

• material increases in our insurance costs and larger deductibles or the inability to obtain insurance at economically reasonable rates 

• significant expenses likely to be incurred if we pursue of creditor rights resulting from operator tenant and borrower defaults and insolvency 

• a potential downgrade of our issuer and longterm credit rating which could increase our cost of capital and any future debt financing 

• refusal or failure by one or more of our lenders under our credit facility to fund their financing commitments to us as a result of lender liquidity andor viability challenges which financing commitments we may not be able to replace on favorable terms or at all 

• the likelihood that conditions related to the covid pandemic may require us to recognize additional impairments of longlived assets or credit losses related to loans receivable 

• the impact of negative or adverse publicity associated with covid outbreaks at our ccrc properties or the properties in our swf sh jv the cost of responding to such adverse publicity and the potential for heightened regulatory scrutiny caused by it 

• a deterioration of state and local economic conditions and job losses particularly in san francisco san diego and boston which may decrease demand for and occupancy levels at our life science properties and cause our rental rates and property values to be negatively impacted and 

• the potential for shifts in consumer and business behaviors that fundamentally and adversely affect demand for properties in our portfolio 

additionally the covid pandemic could increase the magnitude of many of the other risks described herein and elsewhere in this annual report and may have other adverse effects on our operations that we are not currently able to predict the covid pandemic has also resulted in significant volatility in the local national and global financial markets and we may be unable to obtain any required financing on favorable terms or on a timely basis or at all 

the extent of the impact of the covid pandemic on our business and financial results will depend on future developments including i ongoing resurgences of covid ii health and safety actions taken to contain its spread iii the availability effectiveness and public usage and acceptance of vaccines and treatments and iv how quickly and to what extent normal economic and operating conditions can resume within the markets in which we operate each of which are highly uncertain at this time and outside of our control even after the covid pandemic subsides we may continue to experience adverse impacts to our business and financial results because of its national and global economic impact and any permanent changes in traditional economic patterns and arrangements the covid pandemic could have a material adverse impact on our business results of operations and financial condition 

decreases in our tenants’ operators’ or borrowers’ revenues or increases in their expenses could affect their ability to meet their financial and other contractual obligations to us and could result in amendments to these obligations that have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

we have limited control over the success or failure of our tenants’ operators’ and borrowers’ businesses regardless of whether our relationship is structured as a triplenet lease a ridea lease or as a lender to our borrowers any of our tenants or our operators under a ridea structure may experience a downturn in their business that materially weakens their financial condition for example i our operators under a ridea structure and certain of our tenants in our medical office portfolio experienced a significant downturn in their businesses due to the covid pandemic including as a result of interruptions in their operations lost revenues increased costs financing difficulties and labor shortages and ii our tenants in the life science industry face various risks to their businesses as discussed below under “—our tenants in the life science industry face high levels of regulation funding requirements expense and uncertainty” as a result our tenants operators and borrowers may be unable or unwilling to make payments or perform their obligations when due although we generally have arrangements and other agreements that give us the right under specified circumstances to terminate a lease evict a tenant or terminate our operator or demand immediate repayment of outstanding loan amounts or other obligations to us we may not be able to enforce such rights or we may determine not to do so if we believe that enforcement of our rights would be more detrimental to our business than seeking alternative approaches 

our ccrc segment and our swf sh jv all of which are under a ridea structure primarily depend on private sources for their revenues and the ability of their patients and residents to pay fees costs associated with independent and assisted living services are not generally reimbursable under governmental reimbursement programs such as medicare and medicaid accordingly our operators of these properties depend on attracting seniors with appropriate levels of income and assets which may be affected by many factors including i prevailing economic and market trends including general inflationary pressures ii consumer confidence iii demographics iv property condition and safety v public perception about such properties and vi social and environmental factors consequently if our operators fail to effectively conduct operations on our behalf or to maintain and improve our properties it could adversely affect our business reputation as the owner of the properties as well as the business reputation of our operators and their ability to attract and retain patients and residents in our properties which could have a material adverse effect on our and our operators’ business results of operations and financial condition further if widespread default or nonpayment of outstanding obligations from a large number of operators occurs at a time when terminating such agreement or replacing such operators may be extremely difficult or impossible including as a result of the covid pandemic we may elect instead to amend such agreements with such operators however such amendment may be on terms that are less favorable to us than the original agreement and may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

our ccrc segment and our swf sh jv also rely on reimbursements from governmental programs for a portion of the revenues from certain properties changes in reimbursement policies and other governmental regulation such as potential changes to the patient protection and affordable care act along with the health care and education reconciliation act of 2010 collectively the “affordable care act” that may result from actions by congress or executive orders may result in reductions in our revenues from our ridea structures operations and cash flows and affect our financial performance through a ridea structure in addition failure to comply with reimbursement regulations or other laws applicable to healthcare providers could result in penalties fines litigation costs lost revenue or other consequences which could adversely impact our cash flows from operations under a ridea structure 

revenues of our ccrc segment and our swf sh jv are also dependent on a number of other factors including licensed bed capacity occupancy the healthcare needs of residents the rate of reimbursement the income and assets of seniors in the regions in which we own properties and social and environmental factors for example due to generally increased vulnerability to illness covid has resulted in and another epidemic or pandemic a severe flu season or any other widespread illness could result in early moveouts or delayed moveins during quarantine periods or during periods when actual or perceived risks of such illnesses are heightened which have reduced and could continue to reduce our operators’ revenues additionally new and evolving payor and provider programs in the united states including medicare advantage dual eligible accountable care organizations bundled payments and other valuebased reimbursement arrangements have resulted in reduced reimbursement rates average length of stay and average daily census particularly for higher acuity patients if our operators of these properties underperform our business results of operations and financial condition would be materially adversely affected 

our tenants and operators have and may continue to seek to offset losses by obtaining funds under the cares act or other similar legislative initiatives at the state and local level receipt of these funds is subject to a detailed application and approval process and in some cases entails operating restrictions it is not yet known whether the government funds received by our tenants and operators to date or to be received under any remaining distributions will materially offset the cash flow disruptions experienced by them if they do not receive sufficient funds to offset their cash flow disruptions or if the conditions precedent to receiving or retaining these funds are overly burdensome or not feasible it may substantially affect their ability to make payments or perform their obligations when due to us see “—our participation in the cares act provider relief fund and other covidrelated stimulus and relief programs could subject us to disruptive government and financial audits and investigations regulatory enforcement actions civil litigation and other claims penalties and liabilities” below for risks regarding our cares act participation 

increased competition operating costs and market changes may affect the ability of some of our tenants operators and borrowers to meet their financial and other contractual obligations to us 

occupancy levels at and rental income from our properties are dependent on our ability and the ability of our tenants operators and borrowers to compete with other tenants and operators on a number of different levels including the quality of care provided reputation price the range of services offered the physical appearance of a property family preference alternatives for healthcare delivery the supply of competing properties physicians staff referral sources location and the size and demographics of the population in the surrounding area in addition our tenants operators and borrowers face an increasingly competitive labor market which has been compounded by the covid pandemic an inability to attract and retain trained personnel could negatively impact the ability of our tenants operators and borrowers to meet their obligations to us a shortage of care givers or other trained personnel union activities minimum wage laws or general inflationary pressures on wages may force tenants operators and borrowers to enhance pay and benefits packages to compete effectively for skilled personnel or to use more expensive contract personnel but they may be unable to offset these added costs by increasing the rates charged to residents any increase in labor costs and other property operating expenses or any failure by our tenants operators or borrowers to attract and retain qualified personnel could adversely affect our cash flow and have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

our tenants operators and borrowers also compete with numerous other companies providing similar healthcare services or alternatives such as home health agencies life care at home communitybased service programs retirement communities and convalescent centers this competition overdevelopment in some markets in which we invest covid outbreaks or the negative public perception that additional outbreaks may occur has caused the occupancy rate of buildings to slow or decline and the monthly rate that some properties were able to obtain for their services to decrease our tenants operators and borrowers may be unable to achieve and maintain occupancy and rate levels and to manage their expenses in a way that will enable them to meet all of their obligations to us further many competing companies may have resources and attributes that are superior to those of our tenants operators and borrowers which may also allow them to better withstand the impact of covid or other competitive pressures our tenants operators and borrowers may encounter increased competition that could limit their ability to maintain or attract residents and employees to expand their businesses or to manage their expenses which could materially adversely affect their ability to meet their financial and other contractual obligations to us potentially decreasing our revenues impairing our assets andor increasing collection and dispute costs 

financial deterioration insolvency or bankruptcy of one or more of our major tenants operators or borrowers could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

a downturn in any of our tenants’ operators’ or borrowers’ businesses including downturns due to the covid pandemic has led and could continue to lead to voluntary or involuntary bankruptcy or similar insolvency proceedings including assignment for the benefit of creditors liquidation or windingup bankruptcy and insolvency laws afford certain rights to a defaulting tenant operator or borrower that has filed for bankruptcy or reorganization that may render certain of our remedies unenforceable or at the least delay our ability to pursue such remedies and realize any related recoveries 

a debtor has the right to assume or to assume and assign to a third party or to reject its executory contracts and unexpired leases in a bankruptcy proceeding if a debtor were to reject its leases with us obligations under such rejected leases would cease the claim against the rejecting debtor for remaining rental payments due under the lease would be an unsecured claim which would be limited by the statutory cap set forth in the us bankruptcy code this statutory cap may be substantially less than the remaining rent actually owed under the lease in addition a debtor may also assert in bankruptcy proceedings that certain leases should be recharacterized as financing agreements which could result in our being deemed a lender instead of a landlord a lender’s rights and remedies as compared to a landlord’s generally are materially less favorable and our rights as a lender may be subordinated to other creditors’ rights 

furthermore the automatic stay provisions of the us bankruptcy code would preclude us from enforcing our remedies unless we first obtain relief from the court having jurisdiction over the bankruptcy case this would effectively limit or delay our ability to collect unpaid rent or interest payments and we may ultimately not receive any payment at all in addition we would likely be required to fund certain expenses and obligations eg real estate taxes insurance debt costs and maintenance expenses to preserve the value of our properties avoid the imposition of liens on our properties or transition our properties to a new tenant or operator 

if we are unable to transition affected properties they would likely experience prolonged operational disruption leading to lower occupancy rates and further depressed revenues publicity about the operator’s financial condition and insolvency proceeds may also negatively impact their and our reputations decreasing customer demand and revenues any or all of these risks could have a material adverse effect on our revenues results of operations and cash flows these risks would be magnified where we lease multiple properties to a single operator under a master lease as an operator failure or default under a master lease would expose us to these risks across multiple properties 

we depend on real estate investments particularly in the healthcare property sector making our profitability more vulnerable to a downturn or slowdown in that specific sector than if we were investing in multiple industries and exposing us to the risks inherent in illiquid investments 

we concentrate our investments in the healthcare property sector a downturn or slowdown in the healthcare property sector such as the downturn that occurred during the covid pandemic has had and may continue to have a greater adverse impact on our business than if we had investments in multiple industries and could negatively impact the ability of our tenants operators and borrowers to meet their obligations to us as well as the ability to maintain historical rental and occupancy rates which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations in addition such downturns have had and could continue to have a material adverse effect on the value of our properties and our ability to sell properties at prices or on terms acceptable or favorable to us 

in addition we are exposed to the risks inherent in concentrating our investments in real estate our real estate investments are relatively illiquid due to i restrictions on our ability to sell properties under applicable reit tax laws ii other taxrelated considerations iii regulatory hurdles and iv market conditions as a result we may be unable to recognize full value for any property that we seek to sell for liquidity reasons our inability to timely respond to investment performance changes could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

we may have difficulty identifying and securing replacement tenants or operators and we may be required to incur substantial renovation or tenant improvement costs to make our properties suitable for them 

our tenants may not renew existing leases and our operators may not renew their management agreements beyond their current terms if we or our tenants or operators terminate or do not renew the leases or management agreements for our properties we would attempt to reposition those properties with another tenant or operator these difficulties may be exacerbated by the covid pandemic as new operators or tenants may not be willing to take on the increased exposure especially while active cases are occurring healthcare properties are typically highly customized and the improvements generally required to conform a property to healthcare use are costly and at times tenantspecific and are typically subject to regulatory requirements a new or replacement tenant or operator may require different features in a property depending on that tenant’s or operator’s particular business in addition infrastructure improvements for life science properties typically are significantly more costly than improvements to other property types due to the highly specialized nature of the properties and the greater lease square footage often required by life science tenants therefore if a current tenant or operator is unable to pay rent andor vacates a property we may incur substantial expenditures to modify a property and experience delays before we are able to secure another tenant or operator or to accommodate multiple tenants or operators which may have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

additionally we may fail to identify suitable replacements or enter into leases management agreements or other arrangements with new tenants or operators on a timely basis or on terms as favorable to us as our current leases if at all furthermore during transition periods to new tenants or operators we anticipate that the attention of existing tenants or operators will be diverted from the performance of the properties and there may also be increased errors and delays as a result of the transition which would cause the financial and operational performance at these properties to decline following a decline in performance we may not be able to rehabilitate the property to previous performance levels which would adversely impact our results of operations we also may be required to fund certain expenses and obligations such as real estate taxes debt costs and maintenance expenses to preserve the value of and avoid the imposition of liens on our properties while they are being repositioned in addition we may incur certain obligations and liabilities including obligations to indemnify the replacement tenant or operator which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

property development redevelopment and tenant improvement risks can render a project less profitable or unprofitable and under certain circumstances delay or prevent its undertaking or completion 

our healthcare property development redevelopment and tenant improvement projects could be canceled abandoned or delayed or if completed fail to perform in accordance with expectations including as a result of the following possibilities 

• we may not proceed with a development or redevelopment project if we are unable to obtain debt andor equity financing on favorable terms or at all or if we do not otherwise have the liquidity we deem necessary or appropriate for the project 

• a project may be abandoned after expending significant resources including due to i legal and regulatory hurdles including moratoriums on development and redevelopment activities such as the potential moratorium on office and laboratory buildings in the alewife submarket of boston massachusetts that the alewife city council is considering or the failure to obtain necessary zoning entitlements and permits or ii changes in market and economic conditions either of which would result in the failure to recover expenses already incurred 

• a project may not be completed on schedule as a result of a variety of factors over which we have limited or no control including i natural disasters and other catastrophic events ii health crises or other pandemics such as the covid pandemic iii restrictions or moratoriums on development and redevelopment activities iv labor conditions including a labor shortage or work stoppage v shortages of construction materials vi legal and regulatory hurdles including necessary permits and entitlements vii environmental conditions at the property or viii civil unrest and acts of war or terrorism any such delays in project completion would also delay the commencement of rental payments including increases in rental payments following tenant improvement projects 

• construction or other delays at a project may provide tenants the right to terminate preconstruction leases or cause us to incur additional costs including through rent abatement 

• project costs could exceed original estimates due to among other things i increased interest rates ii higher than budgeted costs for materials transportation environmental remediation labor or other inputs including those caused by a shortage of construction materials or labor iii negligent construction or construction defects iv damage vandalism or accidents v higher operating costs than we anticipated including insurance premiums utilities real estate taxes and costs of complying with changes in government regulations or increases in tariffs vi higher requirements for capital improvements than we anticipated for development redevelopment or tenant improvement projects particularly in older structures or vii increased costs as a result of unanticipated delay including delays resulting from the factors noted below 

• demand for a project may decrease prior to completion due to competition or other market and economic conditions and leaseup rates rental rates lease commencement dates and occupancy levels at a development or redevelopment project may fail to meet expectations 

• tenants that have preleased at a project may file for bankruptcy or become insolvent or otherwise elect to terminate their lease prior to delivery and 

• a project may have defects that we do not discover through the inspection processes including latent defects not discovered until after we put a property in service 

the realization of any of the foregoing risks could result in not achieving our expected returns on investment and have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

changes within the life science industry may adversely impact our revenues and results of operations 

our life science investments could be adversely affected if the life science industry is impacted by an economic financial or banking crisis a health crisis such as the covid pandemic or if the life science industry migrates from the us to other countries or to areas outside of primary life science markets in south san francisco california san diego california and greater boston massachusetts our ability to negotiate contractual rent escalations on future leases and to achieve increases in rental rates will depend upon market conditions and the demand for life science properties at the time the leases are negotiated and the increases are proposed if economic financial or industry conditions adversely affect our life science tenants we may not be able to lease or release our properties in a timely manner or at favorable rates which would negatively impact our revenues and results of operations because infrastructure improvements for life science properties typically are significantly more costly than improvements to other property types due to the highly specialized nature of the properties and life science tenants typically require greater lease square footage relative to medical office tenants repositioning efforts would have a disproportionate adverse effect on our life science segment performance 

future mergers or consolidations of life science entities could reduce the amount of rentable square footage requirements of our client tenants and prospective client tenants which may adversely impact our revenues from lease payments and results of operations 

our tenants in the life science industry face high levels of regulation funding requirements expense and uncertainty 

the life science industry is subject to volatility and life science tenants particularly those involved in developing and marketing pharmaceutical products are subject to certain risks including the following 

• significant funding for the research development clinical testing manufacture and commercialization of their products and technologies as well as to fund their obligations including rent payments due to us and our tenants’ ability to raise capital depends on the viability of their products and technologies their financial and operating condition and outlook and the overall financial banking and economic environment if venture capital firms private investors the public markets companies in the life science industry the government or other sources of funding are difficult to obtain or unavailable to support our tenants’ activities including as a result of general economic conditions adverse market conditions or government shutdowns that limit our tenants’ ability to raise capital such as those resulting from the covid pandemic a tenant’s business would be adversely affected or could fail 

• the research development clinical testing manufacture and marketing of some of our tenants’ products require federal state and foreign regulatory approvals that may be costly or difficult to obtain may take several years and be subject to delay including delays brought on by the covid pandemic may not be obtained at all require validation through clinical trials that may face delays or difficulties resulting from the covid pandemic or otherwise require the use of substantial resources and may often be unpredictable if a tenant’s products fail to obtain regulatory approvals a tenant’s business would be adversely affected or could fail 

• even after regulatory approval and market acceptance the product may still present significant regulatory and liability risks including the possible later discovery of safety concerns and other defects and potential loss of approvals competition from new products and the expiration of patent protection for the product 

• our tenants with marketable products may be adversely affected by healthcare reform and the reimbursement policies of government or private healthcare payors 

• our tenants with marketable products may be unable to successfully manufacture their drugs economically 

• our tenants depend on the commercial success of certain products which may be reliant on the efficacy of the product as well as acceptance among doctors and patients negative publicity or negative results or safety signals from the clinical trials of competitors may reduce demand or prompt regulatory actions and 

• our tenants may be unable to adapt to the rapid technological advances in the industry and to adequately protect their intellectual property under patent copyright or trade secret laws and defend against thirdparty claims of intellectual property violations 

if our tenants’ businesses are adversely affected they may fail to make their rent payments to us which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition if our tenants’ businesses fail or if our tenants fail to make their rent payments to us we would need to secure replacement tenants see “—we may have difficulty identifying and securing replacement tenants or operators and we may be required to incur substantial renovation or tenant improvement costs to make our properties suitable for them” above for risks regarding securing replacement tenants 

the hospitals on whose campuses our mobs are located and their affiliated healthcare systems could fail to remain competitive or financially viable which could adversely impact their ability to attract physicians and physician groups to our mobs and our other properties that serve the healthcare industry 

the viability of hospitals depends on factors such as i the quality and mix of healthcare services provided ii competition for patients and physicians iii demographic trends in the surrounding community iv market position and v growth potential as well as the ability of the affiliated healthcare systems to provide economies of scale and access to capital in addition in 2020 most hospitals experienced a significant reduction in revenue due to decreased volumes as well as increased costs as they provided care capacity for potential covid patients there could be additional reductions in revenue in the future if hospitals experience widespread cancellations of elective procedures due to health and safety measures or otherwise if a hospital whose campus is located near one of our mobs is unable to meet its financial obligations and if an affiliated healthcare system is unable to support that hospital or goes bankrupt the hospital may not be able to compete successfully or could be forced to close or relocate which could adversely impact its ability to attract physicians and other healthcarerelated users because we rely on our proximity to and affiliations with these hospitals to create tenant demand for space in our mobs their inability to remain competitive or financially viable or to attract physicians and physician groups could adversely affect our mob operations and have a material adverse effect on us 

in addition changes to or replacement of the affordable care act or other reimbursement regulations could result in significant changes to the scope of insurance coverage and reimbursement policies which could put negative pressure on the operations and revenues of our mobs 

we may be unable to maintain or expand our existing and future hospital and health system client relationships 

we invest significant time in developing relationships with both new and existing hospital and health system clients if we fail to maintain these relationships including through a lack of responsiveness failure to adapt to the current market or employment of individuals with inadequate experience our reputation and relationships will be harmed and we may lose business to competitors which could have a material adverse effect on us 

we assume operational risks with respect to our senior housing properties managed in ridea structures that could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

as the owner of properties under a ridea structure our trs is ultimately responsible for all operational risks and other liabilities of the properties other than those arising out of certain actions by our operator such as gross negligence or willful misconduct operational risks include and our resulting revenues therefore depend on among other things i occupancy rates ii the entrance fees and rental rates charged to residents iii the requirements of or changes to governmental reimbursement programs such as medicare or medicaid to the extent applicable including changes to reimbursement rates iv our operators’ reputations and ability to attract and retain residents v general economic conditions and market factors that impact seniors which may be exacerbated by the covid pandemic including general inflationary pressures vi competition from other senior housing providers vii compliance with federal state local and industryregulated licensure certification and inspection laws regulations and standards viii litigation involving our properties or residentspatients including litigation related to covid ix the availability and cost of general and professional liability insurance coverage or increases in insurance policy deductibles and x the ability to control operating expenses which have increased and may continue to increase due to the covid pandemic although the ridea structure gives us certain oversight approval rights eg budgets material contracts etc and the right to review operational and financial reporting information our operators are ultimately in control of the daytoday business of the property as a result we have limited rights to direct or influence the business or operations of our properties in the ccrc segment and in the properties owned by our swf sh jv and we depend on our operators to operate these properties in a manner that complies with applicable law minimizes legal risk and maximizes the value of our investment failure by our operators to adequately manage these risks could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

we are required under ridea to rely on our operators to oversee and direct these aspects of the properties’ operations to ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations if one or more of our healthcare properties fails to comply with applicable laws and regulations our trs would be responsible except in limited circumstances such as the gross negligence or willful misconduct of our operators where we would have a contractual claim against them which could subject our trs to penalties including loss or suspension of licenses certification or accreditation exclusion from government healthcare programs ie medicare medicaid administrative sanctions and civil monetary penalties some states also reserve the right to sanction affiliates of a licensee when they take administrative action against the licensee additionally when we receive individually identifiable health information relating to residents of our healthcare properties we are subject to federal and state data privacy and security laws and rules and could be subject to liability in the event of an audit complaint cybersecurity attack or data breach furthermore our trs has exposure to professional liability claims that could arise out of resident claims such as quality of care and the associated litigation costs 

rents received from the trs in a ridea structure are treated as qualifying rents from real property for reit tax purposes only if i they are paid pursuant to a lease of a “qualified healthcare property” and ii the operator qualifies as an “eligible independent contractor” as defined in the internal revenue code of 1986 as amended the “code” if either of these requirements is not satisfied then the rents will not be qualifying rents 

economic and other conditions that negatively affect geographic areas from which a greater percentage of our revenue is recognized could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

we are subject to increased exposure to adverse conditions affecting the geographies in which our properties are located including i downturns in local economies and increases in unemployment rates ii changes in local real estate conditions including increases in real estate taxes iii increased competition iv decreased demand v changes in statespecific legislation and vi local climate events and natural disasters and other catastrophic events such as health pandemics including the covid pandemic earthquakes hurricanes windstorms flooding wildfires and mudslides and other physical climate risks including water stress and heat stress these risks could significantly disrupt our businesses in the region harm our ability to compete effectively result in increased costs and divert management attention any or all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

in addition if significant changes in the climate occur in areas where we own property this could result in extreme weather and changes in precipitation and temperature all of which could result in physical damage to or a decrease in demand for properties located in these areas or affected by these conditions if changes in the climate have material effects such as property destruction or occur for extended periods this could have a material adverse effect on business results of operations and financial condition in addition changes in federal state and local legislation and regulation on climate change could require increased capital expenditures to improve the energy efficiency or resiliency of our existing properties and could also cause increased costs for our new developments without a corresponding increase in revenue 

uninsured or underinsured losses could result in a significant loss of capital invested in a property lower than expected future revenues and unanticipated expense 

our insurance coverage does not include damages from business interruptions loss of revenue or earnings or any related effects caused by health pandemics including the covid pandemic we may incur significant outofpocket costs associated with legal proceedings or other claims from residents and patients at our properties that relate to the covid pandemic 

generally insurance coverage for health pandemics has not previously been readily available and if and when it does become available may not be on commercially reasonable terms further even if such coverage is available on commercially reasonable terms we cannot assure you that we would receive insurance proceeds that will compensate us fully for our liabilities costs and expenses in the event of a health pandemic in addition a large number of our properties are located in areas exposed to earthquakes hurricanes windstorms flooding water stress heat stress and other common natural disasters and physical climate risks in particular i a significant portion of our life science development projects and approximately 67 of our life science portfolio based on gross asset value as of december 31 2021 was concentrated in california which is known to be subject to earthquakes wildfires and other natural disasters and ii approximately 69 of our ccrc portfolio based on gross asset value as of december 31 2021 was concentrated in florida which is known to be subject to hurricanes while we maintain insurance coverage for earthquakes fires hurricanes windstorms floods and other natural disasters and physical climate risks we may be unable to purchase the limits and terms we desire on a commercially reasonable basis in addition there are certain exposures for which we do not purchase insurance because we do not believe it is economically feasible to do so or there is no viable insurance market we maintain earthquake insurance for our properties that are located in the vicinity of active earthquake zones in amounts and with deductibles we believe are commercially reasonable because of our significant concentration in the seismically active regions of south san francisco california and san diego california a damaging earthquake in these areas could significantly impact multiple properties which may amount to a significant portion of our life science portfolio similarly a damaging hurricane in florida could significantly impact multiple properties which may amount to a significant portion of our ccrc portfolio as a result aggregate deductible amounts may be material and our insurance coverage may be materially insufficient to cover our losses either of which would adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

if one of our properties experiences a loss that is uninsured or that exceeds policy coverage limits we could lose our investment in the damaged property as well as the anticipated future cash flows from such property if the damaged property is subject to recourse indebtedness we could continue to be liable for the indebtedness even if the property is irreparably damaged in addition even if damage to our properties is covered by insurance a disruption of business caused by a casualty event may result in loss of revenues for us any business interruption insurance may not fully compensate the lender or us for such loss of revenue our ccrc and senior housing operators also face various forms of classaction lawsuits from time to time such as wage and hour and consumer rights actions which generally are not covered by insurance these class actions could result in significant defense costs as well as settlements or verdicts that materially decrease anticipated revenues from a property and can result in the loss of a portion or all of our invested capital 

our use of joint ventures may limit our returns on and our flexibility with jointly owned investments 

we have and may continue to develop acquire andor recapitalize properties in joint ventures with other persons or entities when circumstances warrant the use of these structures our participation in joint ventures is subject to risks that may not be present with other methods of ownership including 

• our joint venture partners could have investment and financing goals that are inconsistent with our objectives including the timing terms and strategies for any investments and what levels of debt to incur or carry 

• because we do not have sole decisionmaking authority we could experience an impasse on certain decisions including budget approvals acquisitions sales of assets debt financing execution of lease agreements and vendor approvals which impasses could result in delayed decisions and missed opportunities and could require us to expend additional resources on resolving such impasses or potential disputes including litigation or arbitration 

• our joint venture partners may have competing interests in our markets that could create conflicts of interest 

• our ability to transfer our interest in a joint venture to a third party may be restricted and the market for our interest may be limited andor valued lower than fair market value 

• our joint venture partners may be structured differently than us for tax purposes and this could create conflicts of interest and risks to our reit status and 

• our joint venture partners might become insolvent fail to fund their share of required capital contributions or fail to fulfill their obligations as a joint venture partner which may require us to infuse our own capital into the venture on behalf of the partner despite other competing uses for such capital 

with respect to our joint ventures we may be limited in our ability to control or influence operations and in our ability to exit or transfer our interest in the joint venture to a third party as a result we may not receive full value for our ownership interest if we tried to sell it to a third party in addition in some instances we andor our joint venture partner will have the right to cause us to sell our interest or acquire our partner’s interest at a time when we otherwise would not have initiated such a transaction our ability to acquire our partner’s interest will be limited if we do not have sufficient cash available borrowing capacity or other capital resources this would require us to sell our interest in the joint venture when we would otherwise prefer to retain it any of the foregoing risks could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

rent escalators or contingent rent provisions in our leases could hinder our profitability and growth 

we derive a significant portion of our revenues from leasing properties pursuant to leases that generally provide for fixed rental rates subject to annual escalations if strong economic conditions result in increases in the consumer price index in excess of the annual escalations our growth and profitability may be limited 

under certain leases a portion of the tenant’s rental payment to us is based on the property’s revenues ie contingent rent if as a result of weak economic conditions or other factors that may be outside of our control the property’s revenue declines our rental revenues would decrease and our results of operations could be materially adversely affected 

additionally some of our leases provide that annual rent is modified based on changes in the consumer price index or other thresholds ie contingent rent escalators if the consumer price index does not increase or other applicable thresholds are not met rental rates may not increase as anticipated or at all which could hinder our profitability and growth furthermore if strong economic conditions result in significant increases in the consumer price index but the escalations under our leases with contingent rent escalators are capped or the increase in the consumer price index exceeds our tenants’ ability to pay our growth and profitability also may be limited 

competition may make it difficult to identify and purchase or develop suitable healthcare properties to grow our investment portfolio to finance acquisitions on favorable terms or to retain or attract tenants and operators 

we face significant competition from other reits investment companies private equity and hedge fund investors sovereign funds healthcare operators lenders developers and other institutional investors some of whom may have greater resources and lower costs of capital than we do increased competition and resulting capitalization rate compression make it more challenging for us to identify and successfully capitalize on opportunities that meet our business goals and could improve the bargaining power of property owners seeking to sell thereby impeding our investment acquisition and development activities similarly our properties face competition for tenants and operators from other properties in the same market which may affect our ability to attract and retain tenants and operators or may reduce the rents we are able to charge if we cannot capitalize on our development pipeline identify and purchase a sufficient quantity of healthcare properties at favorable prices finance acquisitions on commercially favorable terms or attract and retain profitable tenants and operators our business results of operations and financial condition may be materially adversely affected 

we may be unable to successfully foreclose on the collateral securing our real estaterelated loans and even if we are successful in our foreclosure efforts we may be unable to successfully operate occupy or reposition the underlying real estate which may adversely affect our ability to recover our investments 

if a borrower defaults under one of our mortgages or mezzanine loans we may have to foreclose on the loan or take additional actions including acquiring title to the collateral via statutory or judicial foreclosure or commencing collection litigation we may determine that substantial improvements or repairs to the property are necessary in order to maximize the property’s investment potential in some cases because our collateral consists of the equity interests in an entity that directly or indirectly owns the applicable real property or interests in other operating properties we may not have full recourse with respect to assets of that entity or that entity may have incurred unexpected liabilities either of which would preclude us from fully recovering our investment borrowers may contest enforcement of foreclosure or other remedies seek bankruptcy protection against our exercise of enforcement or other remedies andor bring claims for lender liability in response to actions to enforce mortgage obligations foreclosure or collectionsrelated costs high loantovalue ratios or declines in the value of the property may prevent us from realizing an amount equal to our mortgage or mezzanine loan balance upon foreclosure or conclusion of litigation and we may be required to record a valuation allowance for such losses even if we are able to successfully foreclose on the collateral securing our real estaterelated loans we may inherit properties for which we may be unable to expeditiously secure tenants or operators if at all or we may acquire equity interests that we are unable to immediately resell or otherwise liquidate due to limitations under the securities laws either of which would adversely affect our ability to fully recover our investment 

from time to time we have made and we may seek to make one or more material acquisitions which may involve the expenditure of significant funds 

we regularly review potential transactions in order to maximize stockholder value our review process may require significant management attention and a potential transaction could be abandoned or rejected by us or the other parties involved after we expend significant resources and time in addition future acquisitions may require the issuance of securities incurrence of debt assumption of contingent liabilities or incurrence of significant expenditures each of which could materially adversely impact our business financial condition or results of operations in addition the financing required for acquisitions may not be available on commercially favorable terms or at all 

if we are unable to successfully integrate our acquisitions our business results of operations and financial condition may be materially adversely affected 

successful integration of acquired companies depends primarily on our ability to consolidate operations systems procedures properties and personnel and to eliminate redundancies and reduce costs we may encounter difficulties in these integrations potential difficulties associated with acquisitions include i our ability to effectively monitor and manage our expanded portfolio of properties ii the loss of key employees iii the disruption of our ongoing business or that of the acquired entity iv possible inconsistencies in standards controls procedures and policies and v the assumption of unexpected liabilities including 

• liabilities relating to the cleanup or remediation of undisclosed environmental conditions 

• unasserted claims of vendors residents patients or other persons dealing with the seller 

• liabilities claims and litigation whether or not incurred in the ordinary course of business relating to periods prior to our acquisition 

• claims for indemnification by general partners directors officers and others indemnified by the seller 

• claims for return of government reimbursement payments and 

• liabilities for taxes relating to periods prior to our acquisition 

in addition acquired companies and their properties may fail to perform as expected including in respect of estimated cost savings inaccurate assumptions regarding future rental or occupancy rates could result in overly optimistic estimates of future revenues similarly we may underestimate future operating expenses or the costs necessary to bring properties up to standards established for their intended use or for property improvements 

if we have difficulties with any of these areas or if we later discover additional liabilities or experience unforeseen costs relating to our acquired companies we may not achieve the anticipated economic benefits from our acquisitions and this may have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

unfavorable litigation resolution or disputes could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and that of our tenants operators and borrowers and we and our tenants operators and borrowers may experience rising liability and insurance costs 

our tenants operators and borrowers are from time to time parties to litigation including disputes regarding the quality of care at healthcare properties the effect of litigation may materially increase the costs incurred by our tenants operators and borrowers including costs to monitor and report quality of care compliance in addition the cost of professional liability medical malpractice property business interruption and insurance policies that may provide only partial coverage for covid and other environmental or infectious disease outbreaks epidemics and pandemics can be significant and may increase or not be available at a reasonable cost or at all cost increases could cause our tenants and borrowers to be unable to make their lease or mortgage payments or fail to purchase the appropriate liability and malpractice insurance or cause our borrowers to be unable to meet their obligations to us potentially decreasing our revenues and increasing our collection and litigation costs furthermore with respect to our ccrc properties and the properties in our swf sh jv all of which are operated in ridea structures we directly bear the costs of any such increases in litigation monitoring reporting and insurance due to our direct exposure to the cash flows of such properties 

from time to time we are involved in legal proceedings lawsuits and other claims we may also be named as defendants in lawsuits arising out of our alleged actions or the alleged actions of our tenants and operators for which such tenants and operators have agreed to indemnify us furthermore we could experience a material increase in legal proceedings lawsuits and other claims related to the covid pandemic unfavorable resolution of any such litigation or negative publicity as a result of such litigation may have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition regardless of the outcome litigation or other legal proceedings may result in substantial costs disruption of our normal business operations and the diversion of management attention we may be unable to prevail in or achieve a favorable settlement of any pending or future legal action against us 

in particular as a result of our ownership of healthcare properties we may be named as a defendant in lawsuits arising from the alleged actions of our tenants or operators with respect to our triplenet leases our tenants generally have agreed to indemnify us for various claims litigation and liabilities in connection with their leasing and operation of our triplenet leased properties however if any tenant fails to indemnify us pursuant to the terms of its agreement with us we would have to incur the costs that should have been covered by the tenant and to determine whether to expend additional resources to seek the contractually owed indemnity from that tenant including potentially through litigation or arbitration in some instances we may decide not to enforce our indemnification rights if we believe that enforcement of such rights would be more detrimental to our business than alternative approaches regardless such an event would divert management attention and may result in a disruption to our normal business operations any or all of which could have an adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

with respect to our ridea structured properties we are responsible for these claims litigation and liabilities with limited indemnification rights against our operator typically based on the gross negligence or willful misconduct by the operator although our leases provide us with certain information rights with respect to our tenants one or more of our tenants may be or become party to pending litigation or investigation of which we are unaware or in which we do not have a right to participate or evaluate in such cases we would be unable to determine the potential impact of such litigation or investigation on our tenants or our business or results moreover negative publicity of any of our operators’ or tenants’ litigation other legal proceedings or investigations may also negatively impact their and our reputation resulting in lower customer demand and revenues which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flow 

risks related to our capital structure and market conditions 



an increase in our borrowing costs could materially adversely impact our ability to refinance existing debt sell properties and conduct acquisition investment and development activities and could cause our stock price to decline 

an increase in our borrowing costs reduces the amount investors are willing to pay for our common stock because reit stocks are often perceived as highyield investments investors may perceive less relative benefit to owning reit stocks as borrowing costs increase 

additionally we have existing debt obligations that have variable interest rates and related payments that vary with the movement of certain indices if interest rates increase so would our interest costs for any variable rate debt and for new debt this increased cost would make the financing of any acquisition and development activity more costly in addition an increase in interest rates could decrease the amount third parties are willing to pay for our properties thereby limiting our ability to reposition our portfolio promptly in response to changes in economic or other conditions 

rising borrowing costs could limit our ability to refinance existing debt when it matures or cause us to pay higher interest rates upon refinancing and increase interest expense on refinanced indebtedness if our prevailing borrowing costs are higher than the interest rates of our senior notes at their maturity we will incur additional interest expense upon any replacement debt 

we manage a portion of our exposure to interest rate risk by accessing debt with staggered maturities and through the use of derivative instruments primarily interest rate cap and swap agreements these agreements involve risk including that counterparties may fail to honor their obligations under these arrangements that these arrangements may not be effective in reducing our exposure to interest rate changes that the amount of income we earn from hedging transactions may be limited by federal tax provisions governing reits and that these arrangements may cause us to incur higher debt service costs than would otherwise be the case failure to hedge effectively against interest rate risk could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

cash available for distribution to stockholders may be insufficient to make dividend distributions at expected levels and are made at the discretion of our board of directors 

decreases in cash available for distributions including decreases related to the covid pandemic may result in us being unable to make dividend distributions at expected levels our failure to make distributions commensurate with market expectations would likely result in a decrease in the market price of our common stock further all distributions are made at the discretion of our board of directors in accordance with maryland law and depend on i our earnings ii our financial condition iii debt and equity capital available to us iv our expectations for future capital requirements and operating performance v restrictive covenants in our financial or other contractual arrangements including those in our credit facility agreement vi maintenance of our reit qualification and vii other factors as our board of directors may deem relevant from time to time 

if access to external capital is unavailable on acceptable terms or at all it could have a material adverse effect on our ability to meet commitments as they become due or make future investments necessary to grow our business 

we may be unable to fund all future capital needs including capital expenditures debt maturities and other commitments from cash retained from operations and dispositions if we are unable to obtain enough internal capital we may need to rely on external sources of capital including debt and equity financing to fulfill our capital requirements which depends upon a number of factors some of which we have little or no control over including 

• general availability of capital including less favorable terms rising interest rates and increased borrowing costs 

• the market price of the shares of our equity securities and the credit ratings of our debt and any preferred securities we may issue 

• the market’s perception of our growth potential and our current and potential future earnings and cash distributions 

• our degree of financial leverage and operational flexibility 

• the financial integrity of our lenders which might impair their ability to meet their commitments to us or their willingness to make additional loans to us and our inability to replace the financing commitment of any such lender on favorable terms or at all 

• the stability of the market value of our properties 

• the financial performance and general market perception of our tenants and operators 

• changes in the credit ratings on us government debt securities or default or delay in payment by the united states of its obligations 

• issues facing the healthcare industry including healthcare reform changes in government reimbursement policies and the unique challenges posed by the covid pandemic and 

• the performance of the national and global economies generally including any economic downturn and volatility in the financial markets as a result of the covid pandemic 

if access to capital is unavailable on acceptable terms or at all it could have a material adverse impact on our ability to fund operations repay or refinance our debt obligations fund dividend payments acquire properties and make the investments in development and redevelopment activities as well as capital expenditures needed to grow our business 

our level of indebtedness may increase and materially adversely affect our future operations 

our outstanding indebtedness as of december 31 2021 was approximately 62 billion we may incur additional indebtedness which may be substantial any significant additional indebtedness would likely negatively affect the credit ratings of our debt and require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow to interest and principal payments greater demands on our cash resources may reduce funds available to us to pay dividends conduct development activities make capital expenditures and acquisitions or carry out other aspects of our business strategy increased indebtedness can also make us more vulnerable to general adverse economic and industry conditions and create competitive disadvantages for us compared to other companies with comparatively lower debt levels increased future debt service obligations may limit our operational flexibility including our ability to finance or refinance our properties contribute properties to joint ventures or sell properties as needed 

covenants in our debt instruments limit our operational flexibility and breaches of these covenants could materially adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

the terms of our current secured and unsecured debt instruments require us to comply with a number of customary financial and other covenants such as maintaining leverage ratios minimum tangible net worth requirements reit status and certain levels of debt service coverage our continued ability to incur additional debt and to conduct business in general is subject to compliance with these covenants which limits our operational flexibility for example mortgages on our properties contain customary covenants such as those that limit or restrict our ability without the consent of the lender to further encumber or sell the applicable properties or to replace the applicable tenant or operator breaches of certain covenants may result in defaults under the mortgages on our properties and crossdefaults under certain of our other indebtedness even if we satisfy our payment obligations to the respective obligee covenants that limit our operational flexibility as well as defaults resulting from the breach of any of these covenants could materially adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

volatility disruption or uncertainty in the financial markets may impair our ability to raise capital obtain new financing or refinance existing obligations and fund real estate and development activities 

increased or prolonged market disruption volatility or uncertainty including disruption caused by the covid pandemic could materially adversely impact our ability to raise capital obtain new financing or refinance our existing obligations as they mature and fund real estate and development activities for example as a result of the potential or perceived impact of the pandemic on our business lenders and other financial institutions could require us to agree to more restrictive covenants grant liens on our assets as collateral andor accept other terms that are not commercially beneficial to us in order to obtain financing one or more of our lenders under our credit facility could refuse or fail to fund their financing commitment to us as a result of lender liquidity andor viability challenges which financing commitments we may not be able to replace on favorable terms or at all market volatility could also lead to significant uncertainty in the valuation of our investments and those of our joint ventures which may result in a substantial decrease in the value of our properties and those of our joint ventures as a result we may be unable to recover the carrying amount of such investments and the associated goodwill if any which may require us to recognize impairment charges in earnings 

risks related to the regulatory environment 



laws or regulations prohibiting eviction of our tenants even on a temporary basis could have a material adverse effect on our revenues if our tenants fail to make their contractual rent payments to us 

various federal state and local governments have enacted and may continue to enact laws regulations and moratoriums or take other actions that could limit our ability to evict tenants until such laws regulations or moratoriums are reversed or lifted in particular many state and local governments have implemented eviction moratoriums as a result of the covid pandemic that apply to both residential and commercial tenants although many of these moratoriums have been temporary in nature to date and may have expired they may be revised reinstated andor extended for a significant period of time until the covid pandemic subsides although we generally have arrangements and other agreements that give us the right under specified circumstances to terminate a lease or evict a tenant for nonpayment of contractual rent such laws regulations and moratoriums may prohibit our ability to begin eviction proceedings even where no rent or only partial rent is being paid for so long as such law regulation or moratorium remains in effect further under current laws and regulations eviction proceedings for delinquent tenants are already costly and timeconsuming and if there are existing backlogs or backlogs develop in courts due to higher than normal eviction proceedings whether or not due to an increase in eviction proceedings after the covid pandemic we may incur significant costs and it may take a significant amount of time to ultimately evict any tenant who is not meeting their contractual rent obligations if we are restricted delayed or prohibited from evicting tenants for failing to make contractual rent payments our business results of operations and financial condition may be materially adversely impacted 

tenants operators and borrowers that fail to comply with federal state local and international laws and regulations including resident health and safety requirements as well as licensure certification and inspection requirements may cease to operate or be unable to meet their financial and other contractual obligations to us 

our tenants operators and borrowers in all of our segments are subject to or impacted by extensive frequently changing federal state and local laws and regulations see “item 1—business—government regulation licensing and enforcement—healthcare licensure and certificate of need” for a discussion of certain of these laws and regulations our tenants’ operators’ or borrowers’ failure to comply with any of the laws regulations or requirements applicable to them could result in i loss of accreditation ii denial of reimbursement iii imposition of fines iv suspension or decertification from government healthcare programs v civil liability and vi in certain instances criminal penalties loss of license or closure of the property andor the incurrence of considerable costs arising from an investigation or regulatory action which may have an adverse effect on properties that we own and lease to a third party tenant in our life science and mob segments that we own and operate through a ridea structure in our ccrc segment or our swf sh jv or on which we hold a mortgage and therefore may materially adversely impact us 

required regulatory approvals can delay or prohibit transfers of our senior housing properties 

transfers of senior housing properties including ccrcs to successor owners or operators are typically subject to regulatory approvals or ratifications including change of ownership approvals for licensure and medicare  medicaid if applicable that are not required for transfers of other types of commercial operations and other types of real estate the sale of or replacement of any operator at our ccrc and senior housing facilities could be delayed by the regulatory approval process of any federal state or local government agency necessary for the transfer of the property or the replacement of the operator licensed to manage the property during which time the property may experience performance declines the continuing effects of the covid pandemic may materially delay necessary approvals thereby lengthening the period of performance deterioration which could have a material adverse effect of our business results of operations and financial condition we may also elect to use an interim licensing structure to facilitate such transfers which structure expedites the transfer by allowing a third party to operate under our license until the required regulatory approvals are obtained but could subject us to fines or penalties if the third party fails to comply with applicable laws and regulations and then fails to indemnify us for such fines or penalties pursuant to the terms of its agreement with us 

compliance with the americans with disabilities act and fire safety and other regulations may require us to make expenditures that adversely affect our cash flows 

our properties must comply with applicable ada and any similar state and local laws these laws may require removal of barriers to access by persons with disabilities in public areas of our properties noncompliance could result in the incurrence of additional costs associated with bringing the properties into compliance the imposition of fines or an award of damages to private litigants in individual lawsuits or as part of a class action while the tenants to whom we lease our properties are obligated to comply with the ada and similar state and local provisions and typically under tenant leases are obligated to cover costs associated with compliance if required changes involve greater expenditures than anticipated or if the changes must be made on a more accelerated basis than anticipated the ability of these tenants to cover costs could be adversely affected as a result we could be required to expend funds to comply with the provisions of the ada and similar state and local laws on behalf of tenants which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition additionally with respect to the properties owned by our swf sh jv under a ridea structures the swf sh jv is ultimately responsible for such litigation and compliance costs and at our ccrcs we are responsible for such litigation and compliance costs 

in addition we are required to operate our properties in compliance with fire and safety regulations building codes and other land use regulations new and revised regulations and codes may be adopted by governmental agencies and bodies and become applicable to our properties for example new safety laws for senior housing properties were adopted following the particularly damaging 2018 hurricane season compliance could require substantial capital expenditures both for significant upgrades and for tenant relocations that may be necessary depending on the scope and duration of upgrades and may restrict our ability to renovate our properties these expenditures and restrictions could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and cash flows 

the requirements of or changes to governmental reimbursement programs such as medicare or medicaid may adversely affect our tenants’ operators’ and borrowers’ ability to meet their financial and other contractual obligations to us 

certain of our tenants operators and borrowers are affected directly or indirectly by a complex set of federal state and local laws and regulations pertaining to governmental reimbursement programs including the cares act and other similar relief legislation enacted as a result of the covid pandemic these laws and regulations are subject to frequent and substantial changes that are sometimes applied retroactively see “item 1—business—government regulation licensing and enforcement” for example to the extent that our tenants operators or borrowers receive a significant portion of their revenues from governmental payors primarily medicare and medicaid they are generally subject to among other things 

• statutory and regulatory changes 

• retroactive rate adjustments 

• recovery of program overpayments or setoffs 

• federal state and local litigation and enforcement actions 

• administrative proceedings 

• policy interpretations 

• payment or other delays by fiscal intermediaries or carriers 

• government funding restrictions at a program level or with respect to specific properties 

• reduced reimbursement rates under managed care contracts 

• interruption or delays in payments due to any ongoing governmental investigations and audits at such properties and 

• reputational harm of publicly disclosed enforcement actions audits or investigations related to billing and reimbursements 

the failure to comply with the extensive laws regulations and other requirements applicable to their business and the operation of our properties could result in among other challenges i becoming ineligible to receive reimbursement from governmental reimbursement programs including under the cares act ii becoming subject to prepayment reviews or claims for overpayments iii bans on admissions of new patients or residents iv civil or criminal penalties and v significant operational changes including requirements to increase staffing or the scope of care given to residents these laws and regulations are enforced by a variety of federal state and local agencies and can also be enforced by private litigants through among other things federal and state false claims acts which allow private litigants to bring qui tam or “whistleblower” actions 

we are unable to predict future changes to or interpretations of federal state and local statutes and regulations including the medicare and medicaid statutes and regulations or the intensity of enforcement efforts with respect to such statutes and regulations any changes in the regulatory framework or the intensity or extent of governmental or private enforcement actions could have a material adverse effect on our tenants and operators 

sometimes governmental payors freeze or reduce payments to healthcare providers or provide annual reimbursement rate increases that are smaller than expected due to budgetary and other pressures in addition the federal government periodically makes changes in the statutes and regulations relating to medicare and medicaid reimbursement that may impact state reimbursement programs particularly medicaid reimbursement and managed care payments we cannot make any assessment as to the ultimate timing or the effect that any future changes may have on our tenants’ operators’ and borrowers’ costs of doing business and on the amount of reimbursement by government and other thirdparty payors the failure of any of our tenants operators or borrowers to comply with these laws and regulations and significant limits on the scope of services reimbursed reductions in reimbursement rates and fees or increases in provider or similar types of taxes could materially adversely affect their ability to meet their financial and contractual obligations to us 

furthermore executive orders and legislation may amend the affordable care act and related regulations in whole or in part we also anticipate that congress state legislatures and thirdparty payors may continue to review and assess alternative healthcare delivery and payment systems and may propose and adopt legislation or policy changes or implementations effecting additional fundamental changes in the healthcare system for example the department of health and human services has focused on tying medicare payments to quality or value through alternative payment models which generally aim to make providers attentive to the total costs of treatments medicare no longer reimburses hospitals for care related to certain preventable adverse events and imposes payment reductions on hospitals for preventable readmissions these punitive approaches could be expanded to additional types of providers in the future additionally the patient driven payment model utilized by the centers for medicare and medicaid services to calculate reimbursement rates for patients in skilled nursing properties which is among the unit types in our ccrcs could result in decreases in payments to our operators and tenants or increase our operators’ and tenants’ costs if any such changes significantly and adversely affect our tenants’ profitability they could in turn negatively affect our tenants’ ability and willingness to comply with the terms of their leases with us andor renew their leases with us upon expiration which could impact our business prospects financial condition or results of operations 

legislation to address federal government operations and administration decisions affecting the centers for medicare and medicaid services could have a material adverse effect on our tenants’ operators’ and borrowers’ liquidity financial condition or results of operations 

congressional consideration of legislation pertaining to the federal debt ceiling the affordable care act tax reform and entitlement programs including reimbursement rates for physicians could have a material adverse effect on our tenants’ operators’ and borrowers’ liquidity financial condition or results of operations in particular reduced funding for entitlement programs such as medicare and medicaid would result in increased costs and fees for programs such as medicare advantage plans and additional reductions in reimbursements to providers amendments to the affordable care act in whole or in part and decisions by the centers for medicare and medicaid services could impact the delivery of services and benefits under medicare medicaid or medicare advantage plans and could affect our tenants and operators and the manner in which they are reimbursed by such programs any such material adverse effect on our tenants operators or borrowers could adversely affect their ability to satisfy their obligations to us and could have a material adverse effect on us 

our participation in the cares act provider relief fund and other covidrelated stimulus and relief programs could subject us to disruptive government and financial audits and investigations regulatory enforcement actions civil litigation and other claims penalties and liabilities 

under the cares act and subsequent relief legislation congress has allocated more than 178 billion to eligible hospitals physicians and other health care providers through the public health and social services emergency fund the “provider relief fund” or “prf” the us department of health and human services “hhs” has distributed prf awards through various general and targeted distributions including certain distributions that were paid automatically to providers and others that required providers to submit requested data or applications we and our senior housing operators including operators of senior housing facilities that we have subsequently disposed of have received funds through several prf distributions both via automatic payments and also as a result of applications or other filings we submitted for prf funds 

prf funds are intended to reimburse eligible providers for unreimbursed health carerelated expenses and lost revenues attributable to covid and must be used only to prevent prepare for or respond to covid prf funds received under certain targeted distributions including the nursing home infection control distribution are further limited to specific uses additionally the prf program imposes certain distributionspecific eligibility criteria and requires recipients to comply with various terms and conditions hhs has stated that compliance with prf program terms and conditions is material to hhs’s decision to disburse prf payments to recipients prf program terms and conditions include limitations and requirements governing use of prf funds implementation of controls retention of records relating to prf funds audit and reporting to governmental authorities and other prf program requirements prf regulatory guidance regarding eligibility use of funds audit reporting and other prf terms and conditions continues to evolve and there is a high degree of uncertainty surrounding interpretation and implementation particularly among more complex corporate transactional and contractual relationships including ridea structures and for organizations with multiple recipient subsidiaries in addition in light of the evolving laws and guidance related to prf there is no assurance that prf guidance will not change in ways that adversely impact the prf funding we receive our ability to retain prf funding or our eligibility to participate in the prf program 

changing prf program requirements could reduce the amount of prf funds we receive or are permitted to retain and could render us or our operators ineligible for future or previously received prf funds prf reporting obligations and monitoring and compliance efforts could impose substantial costs become overly burdensome and require significant attention from leadership disrupting our business and impeding our operations further our current and former operators may not consistently use account for or document prf and other relief funds which may adversely impact availability of data and consistency in our reporting including among current and former operators and across reporting periods ultimately as prf program requirements continue to evolve we may determine that we are unable to comply with certain terms and conditions or that we are no longer eligible for some or all of the prf payments we or our operators previously received if we are unable to fully comply with applicable prf terms and conditions we may be required to return some or all prf funds received and may be subject to further enforcement action 

due to our and our operators’ participation in the prf program we may be subject to government and other audits and investigations related to our receipt and use of prf funds these audits and investigations also may impose substantial costs and disruptions if the government determines that we failed to comply with prf terms and conditions related interpretative guidance or applicable federal award requirements or that our prf applications and submissions were defective prf funds that we or our operators have received may be subject to recoupment and further enforcement actions could result this could occur even if our interpretation of prf program requirements was reasonable under the present or thenexisting prf guidance government audits and investigations also could result in other regulatory penalties or enforcement actions including actions under the false claims act “fca” which prohibits false claims for payments to or improper retention of overpayments from the government fca litigation could be asserted directly by the federal government or on its behalf by private litigants as “whistleblowers” even if not meritorious fca litigation could impose significant costs and result in reputational damage and a disruption of our business

the maryland business combination act the “mbca” provides that unless exempted a maryland corporation may not engage in business combinations including a merger consolidation share exchange or in circumstances specified in the statute an asset transfer or issuance or reclassification of equity securities with an “interested stockholder” or an affiliate of an interested stockholder for five years after the most recent date on which the interested stockholder became an interested stockholder and thereafter unless specified criteria are met an interested stockholder is generally a person owning or controlling directly or indirectly 10 or more of the voting power of the outstanding voting stock of a maryland corporation unless our board of directors takes action to exempt us from the mbca it will be applicable to business combinations between us and other persons in addition to the restrictions on business combinations contained in the mbca our charter also requires that except in certain circumstances “business combinations” including a merger or consolidation and certain asset transfers and issuances of securities with a “related person” including a beneficial owner of 10 or more of our outstanding voting stock be approved by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 90 of our outstanding voting stock these restrictions on business combinations may delay defer or prevent a change of control or other transaction even if such transaction involves a premium price for our common stock or our stockholders believe that such transaction is otherwise in their best interests 

environmental compliance costs and liabilities associated with our real estaterelated investments may be substantial and may materially impair the value of those investments 

federal state and local laws ordinances and regulations may require us as a current or previous owner of real estate to investigate and clean up certain hazardous or toxic substances released at a property we may be held liable to a governmental entity or to third parties for injury or property damage and for investigation and cleanup costs incurred in connection with the contamination the costs of cleanup and remediation could be substantial in addition some environmental laws create a lien on the contaminated site in favor of the government for damages and the costs it incurs in connection with the contamination andor impose fines and penalties on the property owner with respect to such contamination 

although we currently carry environmental insurance on our properties in an amount that we believe is commercially reasonable and generally require our tenants and operators to indemnify us for environmental liabilities they cause such liabilities could exceed the amount of our insurance the financial ability of the tenant or operator to indemnify us or the value of the contaminated property as the owner of a site we may also be held liable to third parties for damages and injuries resulting from environmental contamination emanating from the site we may also experience environmental costs and liabilities arising from conditions not known to us or disrupted during development the cost of defending against these claims complying with environmental regulatory requirements conducting remediation of any contaminated property or paying personal injury or other claims or fines could be substantial and could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition in addition the presence of contamination or the failure to remediate contamination may materially adversely affect our ability to use develop sell or lease the property or to borrow using the property as collateral 

risks related to tax including reitrelated risks 



loss of our tax status as a reit would substantially reduce our available funds and would have materially adverse consequences for us and the value of our common stock 

qualification as a reit involves the application of numerous highly technical and complex provisions of the code for which there are limited judicial and administrative interpretations as well as the determination of various factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control we intend to continue to operate in a manner that enables us to qualify as a reit however our qualification and taxation as a reit depend upon our ability to meet through actual annual operating results asset diversification distribution levels and diversity of stock ownership the various qualification tests imposed under the code 

for example to qualify as a reit at least 95 of our gross income in any year must be derived from qualifying sources and we must make distributions to our stockholders aggregating annually to at least 90 of our reit taxable income excluding net capital gains rents we receive from a trs in a ridea structure are treated as qualifying rents from real property for reit tax purposes only if i they are paid pursuant to a lease of a “qualified healthcare property” and ii the operator qualifies as an “eligible independent contractor” as defined in the code if either of these requirements is not satisfied then the rents will not be qualifying rents furthermore new legislation regulations administrative interpretations or court decisions could change the tax laws or interpretations of the tax laws regarding qualification as a reit or the federal income tax consequences of that qualification in a manner that is materially adverse to our stockholders accordingly there is no assurance that we have operated or will continue to operate in a manner so as to qualify or remain qualified as a reit 

if we lose our reit status we will face serious tax consequences that will substantially reduce the funds available to make payments of principal and interest on the debt securities we issue and to make distributions to stockholders if we fail to qualify as a reit 

• we will not be allowed a deduction for distributions to stockholders in computing our taxable income 

• we will be subject to corporatelevel income tax on our taxable income at regular corporate rates 

• we will be subject to increased state and local income taxes and 

• unless we are entitled to relief under relevant statutory provisions we will be disqualified from taxation as a reit for the four taxable years following the year during which we fail to qualify as a reit 

as a result of all these factors our failure to qualify as a reit could also impair our ability to expand our business and raise capital and could materially adversely affect the value of our common stock 

further changes to us federal income tax laws could materially and adversely affect us and our stockholders 

the present federal income tax treatment of reits may be modified possibly with retroactive effect by legislative judicial or administrative action at any time which could affect the federal income tax treatment of an investment in us the federal income tax rules dealing with us federal income taxation and reits are constantly under review by persons involved in the legislative process the us internal revenue service the “irs” and the us treasury department which results in statutory changes as well as frequent revisions to regulations and interpretations we cannot predict how changes in the tax laws might affect our investors or us revisions in federal tax laws and interpretations thereof could significantly and negatively affect our ability to qualify as a reit as well as the tax considerations relevant to an investment in us or could cause us to change our investments and commitments 

potential deferred and contingent tax liabilities from corporate acquisitions could limit or delay future property sales 

if during the fiveyear period beginning on the date we acquire certain companies we recognize a gain on the disposition of any property acquired then to the extent of the excess of i the fair market value of such property as of the acquisition date over ii our adjusted income tax basis in such property as of that date we will be required to pay a corporatelevel federal income tax on this gain at the highest regular corporate rate there can be no assurance that these triggering dispositions will not occur and these requirements could limit or delay future property sales in addition the irs may assert liabilities against us for corporate income taxes for taxable years prior to the time that we acquire certain companies in which case we will owe these taxes plus interest and penalties if any 

there are uncertainties relating to the calculation of nonreit tax earnings and profits “ep” in certain acquisitions which may require us to distribute ep 

in order to remain qualified as a reit we are required to distribute to our stockholders all of the accumulated nonreit ep of certain companies that we acquire prior to the close of the first taxable year in which the acquisition occurs failure to make such ep distributions would result in our disqualification as a reit the determination of the amount to be distributed in such ep distributions is a complex factual and legal determination we may have less than complete information at the time we undertake our analysis or we may interpret the applicable law differently from the irs we currently believe that we have satisfied the requirements relating to such ep distributions there are however substantial uncertainties relating to the determination of ep including the possibility that the irs could successfully assert that the taxable income of the companies acquired should be increased which would increase our nonreit ep thus we might fail to satisfy the requirement that we distribute all of our nonreit ep by the close of the first taxable year in which the acquisition occurs moreover although there are procedures available to cure a failure to distribute all of our ep we cannot now determine whether we will be able to take advantage of these procedures or the economic impact on us of doing so 

our charter contains ownership limits with respect to our common stock and other classes of capital stock 

our charter contains restrictions on the ownership and transfer of our common stock and preferred stock that are intended to assist us in preserving our qualification as a reit under our charter subject to certain exceptions no person or entity may own actually or constructively more than 98 by value or by number of shares whichever is more restrictive of the outstanding shares of our common stock or any class or series of our preferred stock 

additionally our charter has a 99 ownership limitation on the direct or indirect ownership of our voting shares which may include common stock or other classes of capital stock our board of directors in its sole discretion may exempt a proposed transferee from either ownership limit the ownership limits may delay defer or prevent a transaction or a change of control that might involve a premium price for our common stock or might otherwise be in the best interests of our stockholders 

general risk factors 

the loss or limited availability of our key personnel could disrupt our operations and have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition and the value of our common stock 

we depend on the efforts of our executive officers for the success of our business although they are covered by our executive severance plan and change in control plan which provide many of the benefits typically found in executive employment agreements none of our executive officers have employment agreements with us the loss or limited availability of the services of any of our executive officers or our inability to recruit and retain qualified personnel could at least temporarily have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition and the value of our common stock 

we rely on information technology in our operations and any material failure inadequacy interruption or security failure of that technology could harm our business 

we rely on information technology networks and systems including the internet to process transmit and store electronic information and to manage or support a variety of business processes including financial transactions and records and to maintain personal identifying information and tenant and lease data we utilize software and cloudbased technology from vendors on whom our systems depend we rely on commercially available systems software tools and monitoring to provide security for the processing transmission and storage of confidential tenant and customer data including individually identifiable information relating to financial accounts although we have taken steps to protect the security of our information systems with multiple layers of controls around the data maintained in those systems it is possible that our safety and security measures will not prevent the systems’ improper functioning or damage or the improper access or disclosure of personally identifiable information such as in the event of cyberattacks the risk of security breaches has generally increased as the number intensity and sophistication of attacks and intrusions have increased and we have seen a significant increase in cyber phishing attacks since the onset of the covid pandemic the risk of security breaches has also increased with our increased dependence on the internet while our employees continue to work remotely due to our health and safety policies during the covid pandemic and will continue to work remotely under our planned hybrid model furthermore because our operators also rely on the internet information technology networks systems and software some of our data may be vulnerable to cyberattacks on our operators 

security breaches of our or our operators’ networks and systems including those caused by physical or electronic breakins computer viruses malware worms attacks by hackers or foreign governments disruptions from unauthorized access and tampering including through social engineering such as phishing attacks coordinated denialofservice attacks and similar breaches could result in among other things i system disruptions ii shutdowns iii unauthorized access to or disclosure of confidential information iv misappropriation of our or our business partners’ proprietary or confidential information v breach of our legal regulatory or contractual obligations vi inability to access or rely upon critical business records or systems or vii other delays in our operations in some cases it may be difficult to anticipate or immediately detect such incidents and the damage they cause we may be required to expend significant financial resources to protect against or to remediate such security breaches in addition our technology infrastructure and information systems are vulnerable to damage or interruption from natural disasters power loss and telecommunications failures any failure to maintain proper function security and availability of our and our operators’ information systems and the data maintained in those systems could interrupt our operations damage our reputation subject us to liability claims or regulatory penalties harm our business relationships or increase our security and insurance costs which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

adverse changes in our credit ratings could impair our ability to obtain additional debt and equity financing on favorable terms if at all and negatively impact the market price of our securities including our common stock 

our credit ratings affect the amount and type of capital as well as the terms of any financing we may obtain the credit ratings of our senior unsecured debt are based on among other things our operating performance liquidity and leverage ratios overall financial position level of indebtedness and pending or future changes in the regulatory framework applicable to our operators and our industry if we are unable to maintain our current credit ratings we would likely incur higher borrowing costs which would make it more difficult or expensive to obtain additional financing or refinance existing obligations and commitments for example as a result of the potential impact of the covid pandemic in march 2020 moody’s changed its outlook on our longterm issuer and senior unsecured debt ratings from “stable” to “negative” although moody’s subsequently upgraded our outlook to “stable” any future adverse change in our outlook may ultimately lead to a downgrade in our credit ratings which would trigger additional borrowing costs or other potentially negative consequences under our current credit facilities and debt instruments also if our credit ratings are downgraded or general market conditions were to ascribe higher risk to our ratings our industry or us our access to capital and the cost of any future debt financing will be further negatively impacted in addition the terms of future debt agreements could include more restrictive covenants or require incremental collateral which may further restrict our business operations or be unavailable due to our covenant restrictions then in effect there is no guarantee that debt or equity financings will be available in the future to fund future acquisitions or general operating expenses or that such financing will be available on terms consistent with our historical agreements or expectations

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

the information set forth in this item 7 is intended to provide readers with an understanding of our financial condition changes in financial condition and results of operations this section generally discusses the results of our operations for the year ended december 31 2021 compared to the year ended december 31 2020 for a discussion of the year ended december 31 2020 compared to the year ended december 31 2019 please refer to part ii item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in our annual report on form 10k for the fiscal year ended december 31 2020 filed with the sec on february 10 2021 

we will discuss and provide our analysis in the following order 

• covid update 

• overview of transactions 

• dividends 

• results of operations 

• liquidity and capital resources 

• nongaap financial measure reconciliations 

• critical accounting estimates 

• recent accounting pronouncements 

covid update 

our tenants operators and borrowers have experienced significant cost increases as a result of increased health and safety measures staffing shortages increased governmental regulation and compliance vaccine mandates and other operational changes necessitated either directly or indirectly by the covid pandemic we anticipate that many of these expenses will remain at these higher levels even after the pandemic passes and may reduce margins in the business 

the impact of covid on the ability of our tenants to pay rent in the future is currently unknown we have monitored and will continue to monitor the credit quality of each of our tenants and write off straightline rent and accounts receivable as necessary in the event we conclude that substantially all of a tenant’s straightline rent or accounts receivable is not probable of collection in the future such amounts will be written off which could have a material impact on our future results of operations 

senior housing facilities have been disproportionately impacted by covid and covidrelated fatalities compared to our life science and medical office segments within our ccrc properties and the properties in our swf sh jv average occupancy declined from 856 and 887 respectively for the year ended december 31 2019 to 791 and 727 respectively for the year ended december 31 2021 although the wide availability of the vaccine has reduced the negative impacts of the pandemic in our ccrc communities and the senior housing facilities owned by our swf sh jv we do not yet know the full longterm economic impact of the covid pandemic and whether or when occupancy and revenue will return to prepandemic levels the increase in covid cases caused by recent variants has evidenced the fact that the course of the pandemic is highly uncertain and that unexpected surges or other factors could materially impact recovery from the pandemic adversely disrupt operations andor cause significant reputational harm to us our tenants our operators or our borrowers labor costs in particular have increased as a result of higher staffing hours increased hourly wages and bonuses greater overtime and increased usage of contract labor in addition the pandemic has resulted in some potentially longterm changes in traditional economic patterns and arrangements including that i seniors may not seek out senior housing at the same level that they did prepandemic ii recent legislation that favors delivery of services at home rather than in an institutional setting could negatively impact the segment iii qualified employees may view employment at senior housing facilities less attractively than they did prepandemic iv the number of people who have not returned to the workforce could create longterm staffing shortages v changing expectations around the protection required for residents in senior housing facilities may increase costs vi senior housing operators are undertaking numerous adaptations in response to these changes the success of which adaptations is uncertain and vii the inflationary environment could permanently alter behavior in unpredictable ways 

all development redevelopment and tenant improvement projects that were previously delayed have been allowed to restart with infection control protocols in place although future local state or federal orders could cause work to be suspended and individual projects may be affected by outbreaks 

we believe we remain wellpositioned to navigate economic changes resulting from the pandemic with approximately 22 billion of liquidity available including 181 billion of borrowing capacity under our bank line of credit facility 313 million of net proceeds expected from the future settlement of shares issued through our atm forward contracts as defined below and approximately 117 million of cash and cash equivalents as of february 7 2022 

we have taken and will continue to take proactive measures to provide for the wellbeing of our employees we have implemented systems and processes that have allowed us to work effectively and efficiently in the remote environment the steps taken to protect our employees and afford them a safe working environment continue to evolve along with authoritative guidance on best practices 

see “item 1a risk factors” in this report for additional discussion of the risks posed by the covid pandemic and uncertainties we and our tenants operators and borrowers may face as a result

noi and adjusted noi are nonus generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” supplemental financial measures used to evaluate the operating performance of real estate noi is defined as real estate revenues inclusive of rental and related revenues resident fees and services income from direct financing leases and government grant income and exclusive of interest income less property level operating expenses noi excludes all other financial statement amounts included in net income loss as presented in note 16 to the consolidated financial statements adjusted noi is calculated as noi after eliminating the effects of straightline rents dfl noncash interest amortization of market lease intangibles termination fees actuarial reserves for insurance claims that have been incurred but not reported and the impact of deferred community fee income and expense noi and adjusted noi include our share of income loss generated by unconsolidated joint ventures and exclude noncontrolling interests’ share of income loss generated by consolidated joint ventures adjusted noi is oftentimes referred to as “cash noi” management believes noi and adjusted noi are important supplemental measures because they provide relevant and useful information by reflecting only income and operating expense items that are incurred at the property level and present them on an unlevered basis we use noi and adjusted noi to make decisions about resource allocations to assess and compare property level performance and to evaluate our samestore “ss” performance as described below we believe that net income loss is the most directly comparable gaap measure to noi and adjusted noi noi and adjusted noi should not be viewed as alternative measures of operating performance to net income loss as defined by gaap since they do not reflect various excluded items further our definitions of noi and adjusted noi may not be comparable to the definitions used by other reits or real estate companies as they may use different methodologies for calculating noi and adjusted noi for a reconciliation of noi and adjusted noi to net income loss by segment refer to note 16 to the consolidated financial statements 

operating expenses generally relate to leased medical office and life science properties as well as ccrc facilities we generally recover all or a portion of our leased medical office and life science property expenses through tenant recoveries we present expenses as operating or general and administrative based on the underlying nature of the expense 

samestore 

samestore noi and adjusted cash noi information allows us to evaluate the performance of our property portfolio under a consistent population by eliminating changes in the composition of our consolidated portfolio of properties samestore adjusted noi excludes amortization of deferred revenue from tenantfunded improvements and certain nonproperty specific operating expenses that are allocated to each operating segment on a consolidated basis 

properties are included in samestore once they are stabilized for the full period in both comparison periods newly acquired operating assets are generally considered stabilized at the earlier of leaseup typically when the tenants controls the physical use of at least 80 of the space and rental payments have commenced or 12 months from the acquisition date newly completed developments and redevelopments are considered stabilized at the earlier of leaseup or 24 months from the date the property is placed in service properties that experience a change in reporting structure are considered stabilized after 12 months in operations under a consistent reporting structure a property is removed from samestore when it is classified as held for sale sold placed into redevelopment experiences a casualty event that significantly impacts operations a change in reporting structure or operator transition has been agreed to or a significant tenant relocates from a samestore property to a non samestore property and that change results in a corresponding increase in revenue we do not report samestore metrics for our other nonreportable segments for a reconciliation of samestore to total portfolio adjusted noi and other relevant disclosures by segment refer to our segment analysis below 

funds from operations “ffo” 

ffo encompasses nareit ffo and ffo as adjusted each of which is described in detail below we believe ffo applicable to common shares diluted ffo applicable to common shares and diluted ffo per common share are important supplemental nongaap measures of operating performance for a reit because the historical cost accounting convention used for real estate assets utilizes straightline depreciation except on land such accounting presentation implies that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time since real estate values instead have historically risen and fallen with market conditions presentations of operating results for a reit that use historical cost accounting for depreciation could be less informative the term ffo was designed by the reit industry to address this issue 

nareit ffo  ffo as defined by the national association of real estate investment trusts “nareit” is net income loss applicable to common shares computed in accordance with gaap excluding gains or losses from sales of depreciable property including any current and deferred taxes directly associated with sales of depreciable property impairments of or related to depreciable real estate plus real estate and other real estaterelated depreciation and amortization and adjustments to compute our share of nareit ffo and ffo as adjusted see below from joint ventures adjustments for joint ventures are calculated to reflect our prorata share of both our consolidated and unconsolidated joint ventures we reflect our share of nareit ffo for unconsolidated joint ventures by applying our actual ownership percentage for the period to the applicable reconciling items on an entity by entity basis for consolidated joint ventures in which we do not own 100 we reflect our share of the equity by adjusting our nareit ffo to remove the third party ownership share of the applicable reconciling items based on actual ownership percentage for the applicable periods our prorata share information is prepared on a basis consistent with the comparable consolidated amounts is intended to reflect our proportionate economic interest in the operating results of properties in our portfolio and is calculated by applying our actual ownership percentage for the period we do not control the unconsolidated joint ventures and the prorata presentations of reconciling items included in nareit ffo do not represent our legal claim to such items the joint venture members or partners are entitled to profit or loss allocations and distributions of cash flows according to the joint venture agreements which provide for such allocations generally according to their invested capital 

the presentation of prorata information has limitations which include but are not limited to the following i the amounts shown on the individual line items were derived by applying our overall economic ownership interest percentage determined when applying the equity method of accounting and do not necessarily represent our legal claim to the assets and liabilities or the revenues and expenses and ii other companies in our industry may calculate their prorata interest differently limiting the usefulness as a comparative measure because of these limitations the prorata financial information should not be considered independently or as a substitute for our financial statements as reported under gaap we compensate for these limitations by relying primarily on our gaap financial statements using the prorata financial information as a supplement 

nareit ffo does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with gaap is not necessarily indicative of cash available to fund cash needs and should not be considered an alternative to net income loss we compute nareit ffo in accordance with the current nareit definition however other reits may report nareit ffo differently or have a different interpretation of the current nareit definition from ours 

ffo as adjusted  in addition we present nareit ffo on an adjusted basis before the impact of noncomparable items including but not limited to transactionrelated items other impairments recoveries and other losses gains restructuring and severance related charges prepayment costs benefits associated with early retirement or payment of debt litigation costs recoveries casualtyrelated charges recoveries foreign currency remeasurement losses gains deferred tax asset valuation allowances and changes in tax legislation “ffo as adjusted” transactionrelated items include transaction expenses and gainscharges incurred as a result of mergers and acquisitions and lease amendment or termination activities prepayment costs benefits associated with early retirement of debt include the writeoff of unamortized deferred financing fees or additional costs expenses discounts makewhole payments penalties or premiums incurred as a result of early retirement or payment of debt other impairments recoveries and other losses gains include interest income associated with early and partial repayments of loans receivable and other losses or gains associated with nondepreciable assets including goodwill dfls undeveloped land parcels and loans receivable management believes that ffo as adjusted provides a meaningful supplemental measurement of our ffo runrate and is frequently used by analysts investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of our performance as a reit at the same time that nareit created and defined its ffo measure for the reit industry it also recognized that “management of each of its member companies has the responsibility and authority to publish financial information that it regards as useful to the financial community” we believe stockholders potential investors and financial analysts who review our operating performance are best served by an ffo runrate earnings measure that includes certain other adjustments to net income loss in addition to adjustments made to arrive at the nareit defined measure of ffo ffo as adjusted is used by management in analyzing our business and the performance of our properties and we believe it is important that stockholders potential investors and financial analysts understand this measure used by management we use ffo as adjusted to i evaluate our performance in comparison with expected results and results of previous periods relative to resource allocation decisions ii evaluate the performance of our management iii budget and forecast future results to assist in the allocation of resources iv assess our performance as compared with similar real estate companies and the industry in general and v evaluate how a specific potential investment will impact our future results other reits or real estate companies may use different methodologies for calculating an adjusted ffo measure and accordingly our ffo as adjusted may not be comparable to those reported by other reits for a reconciliation of net income loss to nareit ffo and ffo as adjusted and other relevant disclosure refer to “nongaap financial measures reconciliations” below 

adjusted ffo “affo” affo is defined as ffo as adjusted after excluding the impact of the following i amortization of stockbased compensation ii amortization of deferred financing costs net iii straightline rents iv deferred income taxes and v other affo adjustments which include a amortization of acquired market lease intangibles net b noncash interest related to dfls and lease incentive amortization reduction of straightline rents c actuarial reserves for insurance claims that have been incurred but not reported and d amortization of deferred revenues excluding amounts amortized into rental income that are associated with tenant funded improvements ownedrecognized by us and upfront cash payments made by tenants to reduce their contractual rents also affo is computed after deducting recurring capital expenditures including second generation leasing costs and second generation tenant and capital improvements and includes adjustments to compute our share of affo from our unconsolidated joint ventures more specifically recurring capital expenditures including second generation leasing costs and second generation tenant and capital improvements affo capital expenditures excludes our share from unconsolidated joint ventures reported in “other affo adjustments” adjustments for joint ventures are calculated to reflect our prorata share of both our consolidated and unconsolidated joint ventures we reflect our share of affo for unconsolidated joint ventures by applying our actual ownership percentage for the period to the applicable reconciling items on an entity by entity basis we reflect our share for consolidated joint ventures in which we do not own 100 of the equity by adjusting our affo to remove the third party ownership share of the applicable reconciling items based on actual ownership percentage for the applicable periods reported in “other affo adjustments” see ffo for further disclosure regarding our use of prorata share information and its limitations other reits or real estate companies may use different methodologies for calculating affo and accordingly our affo may not be comparable to those reported by other reits although our affo computation may not be comparable to that of other reits management believes affo provides a meaningful supplemental measure of our performance and is frequently used by analysts investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of our performance as a reit we believe affo is an alternative runrate earnings measure that improves the understanding of our operating results among investors and makes comparisons with i expected results ii results of previous periods and iii results among reits more meaningful affo does not represent cash generated from operating activities determined in accordance with gaap and is not necessarily indicative of cash available to fund cash needs as it excludes the following items which generally flow through our cash flows from operating activities i adjustments for changes in working capital or the actual timing of the payment of income or expense items that are accrued in the period ii transactionrelated costs iii litigation settlement expenses and iv restructuring and severancerelated charges furthermore affo is adjusted for recurring capital expenditures which are generally not considered when determining cash flows from operations or liquidity affo is a nongaap supplemental financial measure and should not be considered as an alternative to net income loss determined in accordance with gaap for a reconciliation of net income loss to affo and other relevant disclosure refer to “nongaap financial measures reconciliations” below

liquidity and capital resources 

we anticipate that our cash flow from operations available cash balances and cash from our various financing activities will be adequate for the next 12 months and for the foreseeable future for purposes of i funding recurring operating expenses ii meeting debt service requirements and iii satisfying funding of distributions to our stockholders and noncontrolling interest members distributions are made using a combination of cash flows from operations funds available under our bank line of credit and commercial paper program proceeds from the sale of properties and other sources of cash available to us 

in addition to funding the activities above our principal liquidity needs for the next 12 months are to 

• fund capital expenditures including tenant improvements and leasing costs and 

• fund future acquisition transactional and development and redevelopment activities 

our longer term investing liquidity needs include the items listed above as well as meeting debt service requirements 

we anticipate satisfying these future needs using one or more of the following 

• cash flow from operations 

• sale of or exchange of ownership interests in properties or other investments 

• borrowings under our bank line of credit and commercial paper program 

• issuance of additional debt including unsecured notes term loans and mortgage debt andor 

• issuance of common or preferred stock or its equivalent 

our ability to access the capital markets impacts our cost of capital and ability to refinance maturing indebtedness as well as our ability to fund future acquisitions and development through the issuance of additional securities or secured debt credit ratings impact our ability to access capital and directly impact our cost of capital as well for example our bank line of credit accrues interest at a rate per annum equal to libor plus a margin that depends upon our credit ratings for our senior unsecured longterm debt our bank line of credit includes customary libor replacement language including but not limited to the use of rates based on the secured overnight financing rate administered by the federal reserve bank of new york we also pay a facility fee on the entire revolving commitment that depends upon our credit ratings as of february 7 2022 we had longterm credit ratings of baa1 from moody’s and bbb from sp global and fitch and shortterm credit ratings of p2 a2 and f2 from moody’s sp global and fitch respectively 

a downgrade in credit ratings by moody’s sp global and fitch may have a negative impact on the interest rates and facility fees for our bank line of credit and may negatively impact the pricing of notes issued under our commercial paper program and senior unsecured notes while a downgrade in our credit ratings would adversely impact our cost of borrowing we believe we would continue to have access to the unsecured debt markets and we could also seek to enter into one or more secured debt financings issue additional securities including under our atm program as defined below or dispose of certain assets to fund future operating costs capital expenditures or acquisitions although no assurances can be made in this regard refer to “covid update” above for a more comprehensive discussion of the potential impact of covid on our business 

material cash requirements 



our material cash requirements include the following contractual and other obligations 

debt as of december 31 2021 we had total debt of 62 billion including borrowings under our bank line of credit and commercial paper program senior unsecured notes and mortgage debt future interest payments associated with such debt total 14 billion 162 million of which are payable within twelve months of our total debt the total amount payable within twelve months is comprised of 5 million of mortgage debt commercial paper borrowings are backstopped by our bank line of credit as such we calculate the weighted average remaining term of our commercial paper borrowings using the maturity date of our bank line of credit see note 11 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 

development and redevelopment commitments our development and redevelopment commitments represent construction and other commitments for developments and redevelopments in progress and includes certain allowances for tenant improvements that we have provided as a lessor as of december 31 2021 we had 387 million of development and redevelopment commitments 279 million of which we expect to spend within the next twelve months 

lease and other contractual commitments our lease and other contractual commitments represent our commitments as lessor under signed leases and contracts for operating properties and include allowances for tenant improvements and leasing commissions these commitments exclude allowances for tenant improvements related to developments and redevelopments in progress for which we have executed an agreement with a general contractor to complete the tenant improvements which are recognized as development and redevelopment commitments and are discussed further above as of december 31 2021 we had total lease and other contractual commitments of 83 million 74 million of which we expect to spend within the next twelve months 

construction loan commitments we have certain loan commitments to fund senior housing redevelopment and capital expenditure projects as of december 31 2021 we had 58 million of construction loan commitments which extend through 2024 

ground and other operating lease commitments our ground and other operating lease commitments represent our commitments as lessee under signed operating leases as of december 31 2021 we had total ground and other operating lease commitments of 549 million 16 million of which are payable within twelve months see note 7 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 

redeemable noncontrolling interests certain of our noncontrolling interest holders have the ability to put their equity interests to us upon specified events or after the passage of a predetermined period of time each put option is subject to changes in redemption value in the event that the underlying property generates specified returns for us and meets certain promote thresholds pursuant to the respective agreements as of december 31 2021 we had 87 million of redeemable noncontrolling interests none of which meet the conditions for redemption as of the balance sheet date see note 13 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 

distribution and dividend requirements our dividend policy on our common stock is to distribute a percentage of our cash flow to ensure that we meet the dividend requirements of the code relative to maintaining our reit status while still allowing us to retain cash to fund capital improvements and other investment activities under the code reits may be subject to certain federal income and excise taxes on undistributed taxable income we paid quarterly cash dividends of 030 per common share in 2021 our future common dividends if and as declared may vary and will be determined by the board based upon the circumstances prevailing at the time including our financial condition 

offbalance sheet arrangements 



we own interests in certain unconsolidated joint ventures as described in note 9 to the consolidated financial statements two of these joint ventures have mortgage debt of 87 million of which our share is 40 million except in limited circumstances our risk of loss is limited to our investment in the joint venture we have no other material offbalance sheet arrangements that we expect would materially affect our liquidity and capital resources 

inflation 



a significant portion of our revenues are derived from leases that generally provide for fixed rental rates subject to annual escalations a period of high inflation could result in increases in the consumer price index in excess of our fixed annual escalations certain of our leases provide that annual rent is modified based on changes in the consumer price index or other thresholds 

most of our mob leases require the tenant to pay a share of property operating costs such as real estate taxes insurance and utilities substantially all of our life science leases require the tenant or operator to pay all of the property operating costs or reimburse us for all such costs 

labor costs interest costs of construction materials and other operating costs may increase during periods of inflation inflationary increases in expenses will generally be offset in whole or in part by the tenant expense reimbursements and contractual rent increases described above

at december 31 2021 nonmanaging members held an aggregate of five million units in seven limited liability companies “downreits” for which we are the managing member the downreit units are exchangeable for an amount of cash approximating the thencurrent market value of shares of our common stock or at our option shares of our common stock subject to certain adjustments such as stock splits and reclassifications at december 31 2021 the outstanding downreit units were convertible into approximately seven million shares of our common stock 

atthemarket program

nongaap financial measures reconciliations 

funds from operations 



the following is a reconciliation from net income loss applicable to common shares the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with gaap to nareit ffo ffo as adjusted and affo in thousands except per share data 



  

1 this amount can be reconciled by combining the balances from the corresponding line of the consolidated statements of operations and the detailed financial information for discontinued operations in note 5 to the consolidated financial statements 

2 for the year ended december 31 2020 includes a 170 million gain upon consolidation of 13 ccrcs in which we acquired brookdales interest and began consolidating during the first quarter of 2020 for the year ended december 31 2019 includes a 161 million gain upon deconsolidation of 19 previously consolidated senior housing assets that were contributed into a new unconsolidated senior housing joint venture with a sovereign wealth fund gains and losses upon change of control are included in other income expense net in the consolidated statements of operations 

3 for the year ended december 31 2020 includes the termination fee and transition fee expenses related to terminating the management agreements with brookdale for 13 ccrcs and transitioning those communities to life care services llc partially offset by the tax benefit recognized related to those expenses the expenses related to terminating management agreements are included in operating expenses in the consolidated statements of operations 

4 for the year ended december 31 2021 includes a 29 million goodwill impairment charge in connection with our senior housing triplenet and shop asset sales which are reported in income loss from discontinued operations in the consolidated statements of operations the year ended december 31 2021 also includes 6 million of accelerated recognition of a marktomarket discount less loan fees resulting from prepayments on loans receivable which is included in interest income in the consolidated statements of operations for the year ended december 31 2020 includes a 42 million gain on sale of a hospital that was in a dfl which is included in other income expense net in the consolidated statements of operations the remaining activity for the years ended december 31 2021 and 2020 includes reserves for loan losses and land impairments recognized in impairments and loan loss reserves recoveries net in the consolidated statements of operations for the year ended december 31 2019 represents the impairment of 13 senior housing triplenet facilities under dfls recognized as a result of entering into sales agreements 

5 in conjunction with establishing a plan during the year ended december 31 2020 to dispose of all of our shop assets and classifying such assets as discontinued operations we concluded it was more likely than not that we would no longer realize the future value of certain deferred tax assets generated by the net operating losses of our taxable reit subsidiary entities accordingly during the year ended december 31 2020 we recognized an associated valuation allowance and corresponding income tax expense 

6 for the year ended december 31 2020 represents the tax benefit from the cares act which extended the net operating loss carryback period to five years 

7 in connection with the acquisition of the remaining 51 interest in the ccrc jv in january 2020 we consolidated the 13 communities in the ccrc jv and recorded the assets and liabilities at their acquisition date relative fair values including the ccrc contract liabilities associated with previously collected nonrefundable entrance fees in conjunction with increasing those ccrc contract liabilities to their fair value we concluded that we will no longer adjust for the timing difference between nonrefundable entrance fees collected and amortized as we believe the amortization of these fees is a meaningful representation of how we satisfy the performance obligations of the fees as such upon consolidation of the ccrc assets we no longer exclude the difference between ccrc entrance fees collected and amortized from the calculation of affo for comparative periods presented the adjustment continues to represent our 49 share of nonrefundable entrance fees collected by the ccrc jv net of reserves and net of ccrc jv entrance fee amortization 

critical accounting estimates 

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us gaap requires our management to use judgment in the application of critical accounting estimates and assumptions we base estimates on the best information available to us at the time our experience and on various other assumptions believed to be reasonable under the circumstances these estimates affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods if our judgment or interpretation of the facts and circumstances relating to various transactions or other matters had been different it is possible that different accounting would have been applied resulting in a different presentation of our consolidated financial statements from time to time we reevaluate our estimates and assumptions in the event estimates or assumptions prove to be different from actual results adjustments are made in subsequent periods to reflect more current estimates and assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain below is a discussion of accounting estimates that we consider critical in that they may require complex judgment in their application or require estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain for a more detailed discussion of our significant accounting policies see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements 

real estate 



we make estimates as part of our process for allocating a purchase price to the various identifiable assets and liabilities of an acquisition based upon the relative fair value of each asset or liability the most significant components of our allocations are typically buildings asifvacant land and lease intangibles in the case of allocating fair value to buildings and intangibles our fair value estimates will affect the amount of depreciation and amortization we record over the estimated useful life of each asset acquired in the case of allocating fair value to inplace leases we make our best estimates based on our evaluation of the specific characteristics of each tenant’s lease factors considered include estimates of carrying costs during hypothetical expected leaseup periods market conditions and costs to execute similar leases our assumptions affect the amount of future revenue andor depreciation and amortization expense that we will recognize over the remaining useful life for the acquired inplace leases 

impairment of longlived assets 



we assess the carrying value of our real estate assets and related intangibles “real estate assets” when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable recoverability of real estate assets is measured by comparing the carrying amount of the real estate assets to the respective estimated future undiscounted cash flows the expected future undiscounted cash flows reflect external market factors and are probabilityweighted to reflect multiple possible cashflow scenarios including selling the assets at various points in the future additionally the estimated future undiscounted cash flows are calculated utilizing the lowest level of identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities in order to review our real estate assets for recoverability we make assumptions regarding external market conditions including capitalization rates and growth rates forecasted cash flows and sales prices and our intent with respect to holding or disposing of the asset if our analysis indicates that the carrying value of the real estate assets is not recoverable on an undiscounted cash flow basis we recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the real estate asset 

determining the fair value of real estate assets including assets classified as held for sale involves significant judgment and generally utilizes market capitalization rates comparable market transactions estimated per unit or per square foot prices negotiations with prospective buyers and forecasted cash flows lease revenue rates expense rates growth rates etc our ability to accurately predict future operating results and resulting cash flows and estimate fair values impacts the timing and recognition of impairments while we believe our assumptions are reasonable changes in these assumptions may have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 

recent accounting pronouncements 

see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for the impact of new accounting standards 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we are exposed to various market risks including the potential loss arising from adverse changes in interest rates we use derivative and other financial instruments in the normal course of business to mitigate interest rate risk we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes derivatives are recorded on the consolidated balance sheets at fair value see note 22 to the consolidated financial statements 

interest rate risk 



at december 31 2021 our exposure to interest rate risk was primarily on our variable rate debt at december 31 2021 142 million of our variablerate debt was subject to interest rate cap agreements the interest rate caps are nondesignated hedges and manage our exposure to variable cash flows on certain mortgage debt borrowings by limiting interest rates at december 31 2021 both the fair value and carrying value of the interest rate caps were 04 million 

our remaining variable rate debt at december 31 2021 was comprised of our bank line of credit commercial paper program and certain of our mortgage debt interest rate fluctuations will generally not affect our future earnings or cash flows on our fixed rate debt and assets until their maturity or earlier prepayment and refinancing if interest rates have risen at the time we seek to refinance our fixed rate debt whether at maturity or otherwise our future earnings and cash flows could be adversely affected by additional borrowing costs conversely lower interest rates at the time of refinancing may reduce our overall borrowing costs however interest rate changes will affect the fair value of our fixed rate instruments at december 31 2021 a one percentage point increase or decrease in interest rates would change the fair value of our fixed rate debt by approximately 309 million and 335 million respectively and would not materially impact earnings or cash flows additionally a one percentage point increase or decrease in interest rates would change the fair value of our fixed rate debt investments by approximately 2 million and would not materially impact earnings or cash flows conversely changes in interest rates on variable rate debt and investments would change our future earnings and cash flows but not materially impact the fair value of those instruments assuming a one percentage point change in the interest rate related to our variablerate debt and investments and assuming no other changes in the outstanding balance at december 31 2021 our annual interest expense would increase by approximately 13 million 

market risk 



we have investments in marketable debt securities classified as heldtomaturity because we have the positive intent and ability to hold the securities to maturity heldtomaturity securities are recorded at amortized cost and adjusted for the amortization of premiums and discounts through maturity we consider a variety of factors in evaluating an otherthantemporary decline in value such as the length of time and the extent to which the market value has been less than our current adjusted carrying value the issuer’s financial condition capital strength and nearterm prospects any recent events specific to that issuer and economic conditions of its industry and our investment horizon in relationship to an anticipated nearterm recovery in the market value if any at december 31 2021 both the fair value and carrying value of marketable debt securities was 21 million

part iv 




 item 1 business 

general overview 



healthpeak properties inc is a standard  poor’s “sp” 500 company that acquires develops owns leases and manages healthcare real estate across the united states “us” our company was originally founded in 1985 we are a maryland corporation and qualify as a selfadministered reit in november 2020 we moved our corporate headquarters from irvine ca to denver co with properties in nearly every state the new headquarters provides a favorable mix of affordability and a centralized geographic location our irvine ca and franklin tn offices will continue to operate 

during 2020 we began the process of disposing of our senior housing triplenet portfolio and senior housing operating portfolio “shop” we have successfully disposed of a significant portion of both portfolios and will continue that process during 2021 refer to a discussion of recent and upcoming dispositions in “item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations—2020 transaction overview” for the current status of transactions as of december 31 2020 we concluded the planned dispositions represented a strategic shift and therefore the assets are classified as discontinued operations in all periods presented herein and prior periods have been recast to conform to the current period presentation see note 5 to the consolidated financial statements for further information regarding discontinued operations 

in conjunction with the planned disposal of our senior housing triplenet and shop portfolios we focused our strategy on investing in a diversified portfolio of highquality healthcare properties across our three core asset classes of life science medical office and continuing care retirement community “ccrc” real estate under the life science and medical office segments we invest through the acquisition development and management of life science buildings medical office buildings “mobs” and hospitals under the ccrc segment our properties are operated through ridea structures see below for a description of ridea structures we have other nonreportable segments that are comprised primarily of interests in an unconsolidated senior housing joint venture and debt investments 

at december 31 2020 our portfolio of investments including properties in our unconsolidated joint ventures and excluding investments classified as discontinued operations consisted of interests in 457 properties the following table summarizes information for our reportable segments excluding discontinued operations for the year ended december 31 2020 dollars in thousands

business strategy 



we invest in and manage our real estate portfolio for the longterm to maximize benefit to our stockholders and support the growth of our dividends our strategy consists of four core elements 

i our real estate  our portfolio is grounded in highquality properties in desirable locations we focus on three purposely selected private pay asset classes life science medical office and continuing care retirement community to provide stability through inevitable market cycles 

ii our financials  we maintain a strong investmentgrade balance sheet with ample liquidity as well as longterm fixedrate debt financing with staggered maturities to reduce our exposure to interestrate volatility and refinancing risk 

iii our partnerships  we work with leading healthcare companies operators and service providers and are responsive to their space and capital needs we provide highquality management services to encourage tenants to renew expand and relocate into our properties which drives increased occupancy rental rates and property values 

iv our platform  we have a peoplefirst culture that we believe attracts develops and retains top talent we continually strive to create and maintain an industryleading platform with systems and tools that allow us to effectively and efficiently manage our assets and investment activity 

internal growth strategies 

we believe our real estate portfolio holds the potential for increased future cash flows as it is wellmaintained and in desirable locations our strategy for maximizing the benefits from these opportunities is to i work with new or existing tenants and operators to address their space and capital needs and ii provide highquality property management services in order to motivate tenants to renew expand or relocate into our properties 

we expect to continue our internal growth as a result of our ability to 

• build and maintain longterm leasing and management relationships with quality tenants and operators in choosing locations for our properties we focus on the physical environment adjacency to established businesses eg hospital systems and educational centers proximity to sources of business growth and other local demographic factors 

• replace tenants and operators at the best available market terms and lowest possible transaction costs we believe we are wellpositioned to attract new tenants and operators and achieve attractive rental rates and operating cash flow as a result of the location design and maintenance of our properties together with our reputation for highquality building services and responsiveness to tenants and our ability to offer space alternatives within our portfolio 

• extend and modify terms of existing leases prior to expiration we structure lease extensions early renewals or modifications which reduce the cost associated with lease downtime or the reinvestment risk resulting from the exercise of tenants’ purchase options while securing the tenancy and relationship of our high quality tenants and operators on a longterm basis 

investment strategies 

the delivery of healthcare services requires real estate and as a result tenants and operators depend on real estate in part to maintain and grow their businesses we believe the healthcare real estate market provides investment opportunities due to the i compelling longterm demographics driving the demand for healthcare services ii specialized nature of healthcare real estate investing and iii ongoing consolidation of the fragmented healthcare real estate sector 

while we emphasize healthcare real estate ownership we may also provide real estate secured financing to or invest in equity or debt securities of healthcare operators or other entities engaged in healthcare real estate ownership we may also acquire all or substantially all of the securities or assets of other reits operating companies or similar entities where such investments would be consistent with our investment strategies we may coinvest alongside institutional or development investors through partnerships or limited liability companies 

we monitor but do not limit our investments based on the percentage of our total assets that may be invested in any one property type investment vehicle or geographic location the number of properties that may be leased to a single tenant or operator or loans that may be made to a single borrower in allocating capital we target opportunities with the most attractive riskreward profile for our portfolio as a whole we may take additional measures to mitigate risk including diversifying our investments by sector geography tenant or operator structuring transactions as master leases requiring tenant or operator insurance and indemnifications andor obtaining credit enhancements in the form of guarantees letters of credit or security deposits 

we believe we are wellpositioned to achieve external growth through acquisitions financing and development other factors that contribute to our competitive position include 

• our reputation gained through over 30 years of successful operations and the strength of our existing portfolio of properties 

• our relationships with leading healthcare operators and systems investment banks and other market intermediaries corporations private equity firms notforprofit organizations and public institutions seeking to monetize existing assets or develop new facilities 

• our relationships with institutional buyers and sellers of highquality healthcare real estate 

• our track record and reputation for executing acquisitions responsively and efficiently which provides confidence to domestic and foreign institutions and private investors who seek to sell healthcare real estate in our market areas 

• our relationships with nationally recognized financial institutions that provide capital to the healthcare and real estate industries and 

• our control of sites including assets under contract with radius restrictions 

financing strategies 

our reit qualification requires us to distribute at least 90 of our reit taxable income excluding net capital gains therefore we do not retain a significant amount of earnings as a result we regularly access the public equity and debt markets to raise the funds necessary to finance acquisitions and debt investments develop and redevelop properties and refinance maturing debt 

we may finance acquisitions and other investments primarily through the following vehicles 

• cash flow from operations 

• sale or exchange of ownership interests in properties or other investments 

• borrowings under our credit facility or commercial paper program 

• issuance of additional debt including unsecured notes term loans and mortgage debt andor 

• issuance of common stock or preferred stock or its equivalent 

we maintain a disciplined balance sheet by actively managing our debt to equity levels and maintaining multiple sources of liquidity our debt obligations are primarily longterm fixed rate with staggered maturities 

we finance our investments based on our evaluation of available sources of funding for shortterm purposes we may utilize our revolving line of credit facility or commercial paper program arrange for other shortterm borrowings from banks or other sources or issue equity securities pursuant to our atthemarket equity offering program we arrange for longerterm financing by offering debt and equity securities placing mortgage debt and obtaining capital from institutional lenders and joint venture partners 

segments 



life science 

our life science properties which contain laboratory and office space are leased primarily to biotechnology medical device and pharmaceutical companies scientific research institutions government agencies and other organizations involved in the life science industry while these properties have characteristics similar to commercial office buildings they generally contain more advanced electrical mechanical heating ventilating and air conditioning systems the facilities generally have specialty equipment including emergency generators fume hoods lab bench tops and related amenities in many instances life science tenants make significant investments to improve their leased space in addition to landlord improvements to accommodate biology chemistry or medical device research initiatives 

life science properties are primarily configured in business park or campus settings and include multiple buildings the business park and campus settings allow us the opportunity to provide flexible contiguousadjacent expansion to accommodate the growth of existing tenants our properties are located in wellestablished geographical markets known for scientific research and drug discovery including san francisco 51 and san diego 24 california and boston massachusetts 21 based on available square feet at december 31 2020 91 of our life science properties were triplenet leased based on leased square feet 

the following table provides information about our life science tenant concentration for the year ended december 31 2020 



medical office 

our medical office segment includes medical office buildings “mobs” and hospitals mobs typically contain physicians’ offices and examination rooms and may also include pharmacies hospital ancillary service space and outpatient services such as diagnostic centers rehabilitation clinics and daysurgery operating rooms while these facilities are similar to commercial office buildings they require additional plumbing electrical and mechanical systems to accommodate multiple exam rooms that may require sinks in every room and special equipment such as xray machines in addition mobs are often built to accommodate higher structural loads for certain equipment and may contain vaults or other specialized construction our mobs are typically multitenant properties leased to healthcare providers hospitals and physician practices with approximately 84 of our mobs located on hospital campuses and 97 affiliated with hospital systems based on available square feet occasionally we invest in mobs located on hospital campuses subject to ground leases at december 31 2020 approximately 61 of our mobs were net leased based on leased square feet with the remaining leased under gross or modified gross leases 

the following table provides information about our medical office tenant concentration for the year ended december 31 2020 



our medical office segment also includes interests in 10 hospitals services provided by our tenants and operators in hospitals are paid for by private sources thirdparty payors eg insurance and hmos or through medicare and medicaid programs our hospital property types include acute care longterm acute care and specialty and rehabilitation hospitals all of our hospitals are triplenet leased 

continuing care retirement community or ccrc 

ccrcs are retirement communities that include independent living assisted living and skilled nursing units to provide a continuum of care in an integrated campus our ccrcs are owned through ridea structures which is permitted by the housing and economic recovery act of 2008 and includes most of the provisions previously proposed in the reit investment diversification and empowerment act of 2007 commonly referred to as “ridea” the services provided by our thirdparty manageroperators under a ridea structure at our properties are primarily paid for by the residents directly or through private insurance and are less reliant on government reimbursement programs such as medicare and medicaid 

a ridea structure allows us through a taxable reit subsidiary “trs” to receive cash flow from the operations of a healthcare facility in compliance with reit tax requirements the criteria for operating a healthcare facility through a ridea structure require us to lease the facility to an affiliate trs under a triplenet lease and for such affiliate trs to engage an independent qualifying management company also known as an eligible independent contractor or thirdparty operator to manage and operate the daytoday business of the facility in exchange for a management fee as a result under a ridea structure we are required to rely on a thirdparty operator to hire and train all facility employees enter into thirdparty contracts for the benefit of the facility including residentpatient agreements comply with laws including but not limited to healthcare laws and provide resident care we are substantially limited in our ability to control or influence daytoday operations under a ridea structure and thus rely on the thirdparty operator to manage and operate the business 

through our trs entities we bear all operational risks and liabilities associated with the operation of these properties with limited exceptions such as a thirdparty operator’s gross negligence or willful misconduct these operational risks and liabilities include those relating to any employment matters of our operator compliance with healthcare and other laws and liabilities relating to personal injurytort matters residentpatient quality of care claims and any governmental reimbursement matters even though we have limited ability to control or influence our thirdparty operators’ management of these risks 

the management agreements we have in ridea structures related to ccrcs have terms ranging from 10 to 15 years with mutual renewal options there are base management fees and incentive management fees payable to our thirdparty operators if operating results of the ridea properties exceed preestablished thresholds conversely there are also provisions in the management agreements that reduce management fees payable to our thirdparty operators if operating results do not meet certain preestablished thresholds 

ccrcs are different from other housing and care options for seniors because they typically provide written agreements or longterm contracts between residents and the communities frequently lasting the term of the resident’s lifetime which offer a continuum of housing services and healthcare on one campus or site ccrcs are appealing as they allow residents to “age in place” and typically require the individual to be independent and in relatively good health upon entry 

as thirdparty operators manage our ridea properties in exchange for the receipt of a management fee we are not directly exposed to the credit risk of these operators in the same manner or to the same extent as a triplenet tenant 

other nonreportable segment 

at december 31 2020 we had the following investments in our other nonreportable segments i an interest in an unconsolidated joint venture that owns 19 senior housing assets ii debt investments and iii two preferred equity investments 

the properties in our unconsolidated senior housing joint venture are owned through ridea structures and include independent living facilities and assisted living facilities which cater to different segments of the elderly population based upon their personal needs these facilities are often in apartmentlike buildings with private residences ranging from single rooms to large apartments 

competition 



investing in real estate serving the healthcare industry is highly competitive we face competition from other reits investment companies pension funds private equity investors sovereign funds healthcare operators lenders developers and other institutional investors some of whom may have greater flexibility eg nonreit competitors greater resources and lower costs of capital than we do increased competition makes it more challenging for us to identify and successfully capitalize on opportunities that meet our objectives our ability to compete may also be impacted by global national and local economic trends availability of investment alternatives availability and cost of capital construction and renovation costs existing laws and regulations new legislation and population trends 

income from our investments depends on our tenants’ and operators’ ability to compete with other companies on multiple levels including i the quality of care provided ii reputation iii success of product or drug development iv the physical appearance of a facility v price and range of services offered vi alternatives for healthcare delivery vii the supply of competing properties viii physicians ix staff x referral sources xi location xii the size and demographics of the population in surrounding areas and xiii the financial condition of our tenants and operators for a discussion of the risks associated with competitive conditions affecting our business see “item 1a risk factors” in this report 

government regulation licensing and enforcement 



overview 

our healthcare facility operators which include our trs entities when we use a ridea structure and tenants are typically subject to extensive and complex federal state and local healthcare laws and regulations relating to quality of care licensure and certificate of need government reimbursement fraud and abuse practices and similar laws governing the operation of healthcare facilities and we expect the healthcare industry in general will continue to face increased regulation and pressure in the areas of fraud waste and abuse cost control healthcare management and provision of services among others these regulations are wide ranging and can subject our tenants and operators to civil criminal and administrative sanctions affected tenants and operators may find it increasingly difficult to comply with this complex and evolving regulatory environment because of a relative lack of guidance in many areas as certain of our healthcare properties are subject to oversight from several government agencies and the laws may vary from one jurisdiction to another changes in laws regulations reimbursement enforcement activity and regulatory noncompliance by our tenants and operators can all have a significant effect on their operations and financial condition which in turn may adversely impact us as detailed below and set forth under “item 1a risk factors” in this report 

the following is a discussion of certain laws and regulations generally applicable to our operators and in certain cases to us 

fraud and abuse enforcement 

there are various extremely complex us federal and state laws and regulations governing healthcare providers’ relationships and arrangements and prohibiting fraudulent and abusive practices by such providers these laws include i us federal and state false claims acts which among other things prohibit providers from filing false claims or making false statements to receive payment from medicare medicaid or other us federal or state healthcare programs ii us federal and state antikickback and feesplitting statutes including the medicare and medicaid antikickback statute which prohibit or restrict the payment or receipt of remuneration to induce referrals or recommendations of healthcare items or services iii us federal and state physician selfreferral laws commonly referred to as the “stark law” which generally prohibit referrals by physicians to entities with which the physician or an immediate family member has a financial relationship and iv the federal civil monetary penalties law which prohibits among other things the knowing presentation of a false or fraudulent claim for certain healthcare services violations of us healthcare fraud and abuse laws carry civil criminal and administrative sanctions including punitive sanctions monetary penalties imprisonment denial of medicare and medicaid reimbursement and potential exclusion from medicare medicaid or other federal or state healthcare programs these laws are enforced by a variety of federal state and local agencies and in the us can also be enforced by private litigants through among other things federal and state false claims acts which allow private litigants to bring qui tam or “whistleblower” actions many of our tenants and operators are subject to these laws and may become the subject of governmental enforcement actions or whistleblower actions if they fail to comply with applicable laws additionally the licensed operators of our us longterm care facilities that participate in government reimbursement programs are required to have compliance and ethics programs that meet the requirements of federal laws and regulations relating to the social security act consistent with ridea such responsibilities are delegated to our operating partners and we have developed a program to periodically monitor compliance with such obligations 

laws and regulations governing privacy and security 

there are various us federal and state privacy laws and regulations including the privacy and security rules contained in the health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 commonly referred to as “hipaa” which provide for the privacy and security of personal health information an increasing focus of the u s federal trade commission’s “ftc’s” consumer protection regulation is the impact of technological change on protection of consumer privacy the ftc as well as state attorneys general have taken enforcement action against companies that do not abide by their representations to consumers regarding electronic security and privacy to the extent we or our affiliated operating entities are a covered entity or business associate under hipaa and the health information technology for economic and clinical health act the “hitech act” compliance with those requirements would require us to among other things conduct a risk analysis implement a risk management plan implement policies and procedures and conduct employee training in most cases we are dependent on our tenants and management companies to fulfill our compliance obligations and we have developed a program to periodically monitor compliance with such obligations because of the far reaching nature of these laws there can be no assurance we would not be required to alter one or more of our systems and data security procedures to be in compliance with these laws our failure to protect health information could subject us to civil or criminal liability and adverse publicity and could harm our business and impair our ability to attract new customers and residents we may be required to notify individuals as well as government agencies and the media if we experience a data breach 

reimbursement 

sources of revenue for some of our tenants and operators include among others governmental healthcare programs such as the federal medicare programs and state medicaid programs and nongovernmental thirdparty payors such as insurance carriers and hmos as federal and state governments focus on healthcare reform initiatives and as the federal government and many states face significant current and future budget deficits efforts to reduce costs by these payors will likely continue which may result in reduced or slower growth in reimbursement for certain services provided by some of our tenants and operators additionally new and evolving payor and provider programs in the us including but not limited to medicare advantage dual eligible accountable care organizations and bundled payments could adversely impact our tenants’ and operators’ liquidity financial condition or results of operations 

healthcare licensure and certificate of need 

certain healthcare facilities in our portfolio are subject to extensive national federal state and local licensure certification and inspection laws and regulations a healthcare facility’s failure to comply with these laws and regulations could result in a revocation suspension restriction or nonrenewal of the facility’s license and loss of a certificate of need which could adversely affect the facility’s operations and ability to bill for items and services provided at the facility in addition various licenses and permits are required to handle controlled substances including narcotics operate pharmacies handle radioactive materials and operate equipment many states in the us require certain healthcare providers to obtain a certificate of need which requires prior approval for the construction expansion or closure of certain healthcare facilities the approval process related to state certificate of need laws may impact the ability of some of our tenants and operators to expand or change their businesses 

product approvals 

while our life science tenants include some wellestablished companies other tenants are less established and in some cases may not yet have a product approved by the food and drug administration or other regulatory authorities for commercial sale creating a new pharmaceutical product or medical device requires substantial investments of time and capital in part because of the extensive regulation of the healthcare industry it also entails considerable risk of failure in demonstrating that the product is safe and effective and in gaining regulatory approval and market acceptance 

senior housing entrance fee communities 

certain of our senior housing facilities primarily our ccrcs are operated as entrance fee communities generally an entrance fee is an upfront fee or consideration paid by a resident a portion of which may be refundable in exchange for some form of longterm benefit typically consisting of a right to receive certain personal or health care services some of the entrance fee communities are subject to significant state regulatory oversight including for example oversight of each facility’s financial condition establishment and monitoring of reserve requirements and other financial restrictions the right of residents to cancel their contracts within a specified period of time the right of residents to receive a refund of their entrance fees lien rights in favor of the residents restrictions on change of ownership and similar matters 

americans with disabilities act “ada” 

our properties must comply with the ada and any similar state or local laws to the extent that such properties are “public accommodations” as defined in those statutes the ada may require removal of barriers to access by persons with disabilities in certain public areas of our properties where such removal is readily achievable to date we have not received any notices of noncompliance with the ada that have caused us to incur substantial capital expenditures to address ada concerns should barriers to access by persons with disabilities be discovered at any of our properties we may be directly or indirectly responsible for additional costs that may be required to make facilities adacompliant noncompliance with the ada could result in the imposition of fines or an award of damages to private litigants the obligation to make readily achievable accommodations pursuant to the ada is an ongoing one and we continue to assess our properties and make modifications as appropriate in this respect 

environmental matters 

a wide variety of federal state and local environmental and occupational health and safety laws and regulations affect healthcare facility operations these complex federal and state statutes and their enforcement involve a myriad of regulations many of which involve strict liability on the part of the potential offender some of these federal and state statutes may directly impact us under various federal state and local environmental laws ordinances and regulations an owner of real property or a secured lender such as us may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of hazardous or toxic substances at under or disposed of in connection with such property as well as other potential costs relating to hazardous or toxic substances including government fines and damages for injuries to persons and adjacent property the cost of any required remediation removal fines or personal or property damages and any related liability therefore could exceed or impair the value of the property andor the assets in addition the presence of such substances or the failure to properly dispose of or remediate such substances may adversely affect the value of such property and the owner’s ability to sell or rent such property or to borrow using such property as collateral which in turn could reduce our earnings for a description of the risks associated with environmental matters see “item 1a risk factors” in this report 

insurance 



we obtain various types of insurance to mitigate the impact of property business interruption liability flood windstorm earthquake fire environmental and terrorismrelated losses we attempt to obtain appropriate policy terms conditions limits and deductibles considering the relative risk of loss the cost of such coverage and current industry practice there are however certain types of extraordinary losses such as those due to acts of war or other events that may be either uninsurable or not economically insurable in addition we have a large number of properties that are exposed to earthquake flood and windstorm occurrences which carry higher deductibles 

we maintain property insurance for all of our properties tenants under triplenet leases are required to provide primary property business interruption and liability insurance we maintain separate general and professional liability insurance for our shop and ccrc facilities additionally our corporate general liability insurance program also extends coverage for all of our properties beyond the aforementioned we periodically review whether we or our ridea operators will bear responsibility for maintaining the required insurance coverage for the applicable shop and ccrc properties but the costs of such insurance are facility expenses paid from the revenues of those properties regardless of who maintains the insurance 

we also maintain directors and officers liability insurance which provides protection for claims against our directors and officers arising from their responsibilities as directors and officers such insurance also extends to us in certain situations 

sustainability 



we believe that environmental social and governance “esg” initiatives are a vital part of corporate responsibility which supports our primary goal of increasing stockholder value through profitable growth we continue to advance our commitment to sustainability with a focus on achieving goals in each of the esg dimensions 

our environmental management programs strive to capture cost efficiencies that ultimately benefit our investors tenants operators employees and other stakeholders while providing a positive impact on the communities in which we operate we regularly assess the risks and financial impacts to our business posed by climate change including potential business disruption and regulatory requirements our compensation and human capital committee of the board oversees all human capital matters including culture diversity inclusion talent acquisition and development compensation and succession planning discussed below under “—human capital matters” in addition our social responsibility committee leads our local philanthropic and volunteer activities our transparent corporate governance initiatives incorporate sustainability as a critical component in achieving our business objectives and properly managing risks

 item 1a risk factors   

the section below discusses the most significant risk factors that may materially adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

as set forth below we believe that the risks we face generally fall into the following categories 

• risks related to our business and operations 

• risks related to the regulatory environment 

• risks related to our capital structure and market conditions 

• risks related to other events 

• risks related to tax including reitrelated risks and 

• general risks 

risks related to our business and operations 



the covid19 pandemic and health and safety measures intended to reduce its spread have adversely affected and may continue to adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

global health concerns and efforts to reduce the spread of covid19 resulted in travel bans quarantines “shelterinplace” and similar orders restricting the activities of individuals outside of their homes as well as business limitations and shutdowns of businesses deemed “nonessential” although some of these restrictions have been lifted or scaled back ongoing resurgences of covid19 infections including new strains have resulted in the reimposition of certain restrictions and may lead to other restrictions being reimplemented to reduce the spread of covid19 in many cases these measures have limited and continue to limit the ability of our tenants operators and borrowers to conduct their normal businesses operations and comply with their rent and other financial obligations to us and because these restrictions may remain in place for a significant amount of time we expect they will continue to place a substantial strain on the business operations of many of our tenants operators and borrowers 

senior housing facilities have been disproportionately impacted by covid and covidrelated fatalities within our shop and ccrc properties average occupancy declined from 832 and 856 respectively for the year ended december 31 2019 to 753 and 814 respectively for the year ended december 31 2020 and we expect occupancy rates will continue to decline for at least the duration of the covid19 pandemic due to a reduction in or in some cases prohibitions on new tenant moveins due to “shelterinplace” and local health department orders stricter movein criteria lower inquiry volumes and reduced inperson tours as well as incidences of covid19 outbreaks at our facilities or the perception that outbreaks may occur outbreaks which directly affect our residents and the employees at our senior housing facilities have and could continue to materially and adversely disrupt operations these outbreaks could cause significant reputational harm to us and our operators and could adversely affect demand for senior housing for an extended period our senior housing property operators are also facing material cost increases as a result of higher staffing hours and compensation as well as increased usage and inventory of critical medical supplies and personal protective equipment at our shop and ccrc facilities we bear these material cost increases the pandemic has also delayed the deployment of capital improvements and expenditures which could adversely impact operations at our senior housing facilities 

we temporarily suspended development and redevelopment projects in the greater san francisco and boston areas as a result of the “shelterinplace” orders and local state and federal directives our operators also temporarily suspended development and redevelopment across our senior housing portfolio for the same reasons around the end of the first quarter of 2020 except for certain life safety and essential projects although these development and redevelopment projects restarted with infection control protocols in place future local state or federal orders could cause us to resuspend the work furthermore construction workers are following applicable guidelines including appropriate social distancing limitations on large group gatherings in close proximity and increased sanitation efforts which has slowed the pace of construction these protective actions do not however eliminate the risk that outbreaks caused or spread by such activities may occur and impact our tenants operators and residents in addition our planned dispositions may not occur within the expected time or at all because of buyer terminations or withdrawals related to the pandemic capital constraints or other factors relating to the pandemic 

within our medical office portfolio many physician practices temporarily discontinued outpatient procedures and nonessential surgeries in 2020 due to health and safety measures which negatively impacted their cash flows during the second quarter of 2020 we implemented a deferred rent program primarily for may and june 2020 that was limited to certain nonhealth system and nonhospital tenants in good standing which resulted in reduced cash flow in the periods in which such deferrals were granted but increased our cash flow in the period in which such deferrals were repaid we may also implement deferred rent programs for future periods in 2020 we experienced a slowdown in new leasing during the governmentmandated shutdown we expect that overall leasing activity will be negatively impacted through the duration of the covid19 pandemic 

within our life science portfolio we may experience a decline in new leasing activity due to the covid19 pandemic in addition as a result of governmental restrictions on business activities particularly in the greater san francisco and boston areas we temporarily suspended development redevelopment and tenant improvement projects at many of our life science properties around the end of the first quarter of 2020 although we were able to restart these projects future governmental restrictions may resuspend them or suspend others we are also experiencing time delays with our development redevelopment and tenant improvement projects due to the implementation of health and safety protocols related to social distancing and proper hygiene and sanitization 

the covid19 pandemic subjects our business and the businesses of our tenants and operators to various risks and uncertainties that have significantly adversely affected and could materially adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition for at least the pendency of the covid19 pandemic and possibly longer including the following 

• rent deferrals or delays in rent commencement for tenants may result in a significant decrease in our cash receipts during the period of the deferrals 

• material cost increases at our shop and ccrc facilities for which we are responsible 

• nonpayment of contractual obligations by our tenants or operators and any limitations on our ability to enforce our lease agreements or management agreements with our tenants or operators as applicable as a result of any federal state or local restrictions on tenant evictions for failure to make contractual rent payments which may result in higher reserves for bad debt 

• our tenants operators or borrowers becoming insolvent or initiating bankruptcy or similar proceedings which would adversely affect our ability to collect rent or interest payments from such tenants or borrowers as applicable and result in increased costs to us as well as decreased revenues 

• the complete or partial closures of or other operational issues at one or more of our properties resulting from government action or directives which may intensify the risk of rent deferrals or nonpayment of contractual obligations by our tenants or operators 

• any possession taken of our properties in whole or in part by governmental authorities for public purposes in eminent domain proceedings or any government mandate or action that requires the use of our properties for the care and treatment of patients suffering from covid19 

• the likelihood that we will amend existing lease agreements and existing rental terms with our tenants and management agreements and existing fee structures with our ridea operators particularly in our senior housing portfolio which would have an adverse effect on our revenues and results of operations 

• increased costs or delays that may result if we determine to reposition or transition any of our currentlyleased properties to another tenant or operator which could adversely impact our revenues and results of operations 

• the impact on our results of operations and financial condition resulting from i suspensions or delays in development and redevelopment activities and tenant improvement projects including due to local state and federal orders or guidelines delays or increased costs caused by slowdowns in construction as a result of implementing social distancing and other health and safety protocols or delays or increased costs caused by a shortage of construction materials or labor as well as potential postponement of rent commencement dates due to delays in tenant improvement projects and ii a decrease in acquisitions and dispositions of properties compared to historical levels 

• reduced valuations for properties in our portfolio that we wish to sell and potential delayed transaction timing due to government delays or government mandated covidrelated access restrictions 

• the need to provide seller financing in order to dispose of certain properties in our portfolio at acceptable prices 

• the impact on our tenants or operators particularly in our senior housing portfolio of lawsuits related to covid19 outbreaks that have occurred or may occur at our properties and the potential that insurance coverage may not be sufficient to cover any potential losses 

• material increases in our insurance costs and larger deductibles or the inability to obtain insurance at economically reasonable rates 

• significant expenses likely to be incurred in connection with our pursuit of creditor rights resulting from operator and tenant defaults and insolvency 

• a potential downgrade of our issuer and longterm credit rating following the change in our outlook from “stable” to “negative” by moody’s which could increase our cost of capital and any future debt financing 

• refusal or failure by one or more of our lenders under our credit facility to fund their financing commitments to us as a result of lender liquidity andor viability challenges which financing commitments we may not be able to replace on favorable terms or at all 

• the likelihood that conditions related to the covid19 pandemic may require us to recognize additional impairments of longlived assets or credit losses related to loans receivable 

• the impact on our business if our executive officers management team or a significant percentage of our employees are unable to continue to work because of illness caused by covid19 as well as the significant time and attention devoted by our management team to monitor the covid19 pandemic and seek to mitigate its effect on our business 

• the impact of negative or adverse publicity associated with covid outbreaks at our senior housing communities the cost of responding to such adverse publicity and the potential for heightened regulatory scrutiny caused by it 

• the deterioration of state and local economic conditions and job losses particularly in san francisco san diego and boston which may decrease demand for and occupancy levels at our life science properties and cause our rental rates and property values to be negatively impacted and 

• the potential for shifts in consumer and business behaviors that fundamentally and adversely affect demand for properties in our portfolio 

the impact of the covid19 pandemic on our shop and ccrc properties managed in ridea structures has had and may continue to have a more significant impact on our results of operations on a relative basis because we receive cash flow from the operations of the property as compared to only receiving contractual rent from a thirdparty tenantoperator under a triplenet lease structure and we also bear all operational risks and liabilities associated with the operation of those properties other than those arising out of certain actions by our operator such as gross negligence or willful misconduct accordingly impacts from the covid19 pandemic directly affecting our shop and ccrc properties including lower net operating income caused by decreased revenues that may result from declines in occupancy or otherwise and increased expenses has had and is expected to continue to have a more direct and immediate impact on our results of operations than such an impact affecting one of our triplenet leased properties in our senior housing portfolio for example increased operating expenses at our shop and ccrc properties including due to labor shortages as well as increased screening and protective measures intended to prevent an outbreak andor slow the spread of a covid19 outbreak has adversely affected and is expected to continue to adversely affect the cash flow from operations we receive from the affected properties in addition our ridea operators who are adversely affected by the covid19 pandemic may request revisions to their management agreements and existing fee structures in order to reduce the amount of cash from operations that flows directly to us because we bear all operational risks and liabilities related to our shop and ccrc properties other than those arising out of certain actions by our operator such as gross negligence or willful misconduct we may be directly adversely impacted by potential lawsuits related to covid19 outbreaks that have occurred or may occur at those properties and our insurance coverage may not be sufficient to cover any potential losses the same factors may also affect our triple net lease tenants and may limit their ability to pay the contractual rent when due 

additionally the covid19 pandemic could increase the magnitude of many of the other risks described herein and elsewhere in this annual report may have other adverse effects on our operations that we are not currently able to predict the covid19 pandemic has also resulted in significant volatility in the local national and global financial markets and we may be unable to obtain any required financing on favorable terms or on a timely basis or at all 

the extent of the impact of the covid19 pandemic on our business and financial results will depend on future developments including the duration severity and spread of the pandemic ongoing resurgences of covid19 in most states health and safety actions taken to contain its spread the availability effectiveness and public usage and acceptance of vaccines and how quickly and to what extent normal economic and operating conditions can resume within the markets in which we operate each of which are highly uncertain at this time and outside of our control even after the covid19 pandemic subsides we may continue to experience adverse impacts to our business and financial results as a result of its national and global economic impact the continued adverse impact of the covid19 pandemic on our business results of operations and financial condition could be material 

we assume operational risks with respect to our shop properties managed in ridea structures that could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

as the owner of a property under a ridea structure our trs is ultimately responsible for all operational risks and other liabilities of the property other than those arising out of certain actions by our operator such as gross negligence or willful misconduct operational risks include and our resulting revenues therefore depend on among other things i occupancy rates ii the entrance fees and rental rates charged to residents iii medicare and medicaid reimbursement rates to the extent applicable iv our operators’ reputations and ability to attract and retain residents v general economic conditions and market factors that impact seniors which may be exacerbated by the covid19 pandemic including the ongoing economic downturn and high unemployment rates vi competition from other senior housing providers vii compliance with federal state local and industryregulated licensure certification and inspection laws regulations and standards viii litigation involving our properties or residentspatients including but not limited to litigation related to covid19 ix the availability and cost of general and professional liability insurance coverage or increases in insurance policy deductibles and x the ability to control operating expenses which have increased and may continue to increase due to the covid19 pandemic although the ridea structure gives us certain oversight approval rights eg budgets material contracts etc and the right to review operational and financial reporting information our operators are ultimately in control of the daytoday business of the property as a result we have limited rights to direct or influence the business or operations of our properties in the shop segment and we depend on our operators to operate these properties in a manner that complies with applicable law minimizes legal risk and maximizes the value of our investment failure by our operators to adequately manage these risks could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

we are required under ridea to rely on our operators to oversee and direct these aspects of the properties’ operations to ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations if one or more of our healthcare properties fails to comply with applicable laws and regulations our trs would be responsible except in limited circumstances such as the gross negligence or willful misconduct of our operators where we would have a contractual claim against them which could subject our trs to penalties including loss or suspension of licenses certification or accreditation exclusion from government healthcare programs ie medicare medicaid administrative sanctions and civil monetary penalties some states also reserve the right to sanction affiliates of a licensee when they take administrative action against the licensee additionally when we receive individually identifiable health information relating to residents of our healthcare properties we are subject to federal and state data privacy and security laws and rules and could be subject to liability in the event of an audit complaint cybersecurity attack or data breach furthermore our trs has exposure to professional liability claims that could arise out of resident claims such as quality of care and the associated litigation costs 

rents received from the trs in a ridea structure are treated as qualifying rents from real property for reit tax purposes only if i they are paid pursuant to a lease of a “qualified healthcare property” and ii the operator qualifies as an “eligible independent contractor” as defined in the internal revenue code of 1986 as amended the “code” if either of these requirements is not satisfied then the rents will not be qualifying rents 

decreases in our tenants’ operators’ or borrowers’ revenues or increases in their expenses could affect their ability to meet their financial and other contractual obligations to us and could result in amendments to these obligations that have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition  

we have limited control over the success or failure of our tenants’ operators’ and borrowers’ businesses regardless of whether our relationship is structured as a triplenet lease a ridea lease or as a lender to our tenants any of our triplenet tenants or operators under a ridea structure may experience a downturn in their business that materially weakens their financial condition for example our triplenet tenants and operators under a ridea structure have experienced a significant downturn in their businesses due to the covid19 pandemic including as a result of interruptions in their operations lost revenues increased costs financing difficulties and labor shortages as a result they may be unable or unwilling to make payments or perform their obligations when due although we generally have arrangements and other agreements that give us the right under specified circumstances to terminate a lease evict a tenant or terminate our operator or demand immediate repayment of outstanding loan amounts or other obligations to us we may not be able to enforce such rights or we may determine not to do so if we believe that enforcement of our rights would be more detrimental to our business than seeking alternative approaches 

our senior housing tenants and our shop segment under a ridea structure primarily depend on private sources for their revenues and the ability of their patients and residents to pay fees costs associated with independent and assisted living services are not generally reimbursable under governmental reimbursement programs such as medicare and medicaid accordingly our tenants and operators of our shop segments depend on attracting seniors with appropriate levels of income and assets which may be affected by many factors including i prevailing economic and market trends including the ongoing economic downturn and high unemployment rates ii consumer confidence iii demographics iv property condition and safety v public perception about such properties and vi social and environmental factors consequently if our tenants or operators on our behalf fail to effectively conduct their operations or to maintain and improve our properties it could adversely affect our business reputation as the owner of the properties as well as the business reputation of our tenants or operators and their ability to attract and retain patients and residents in our properties which could have a materially adverse effect on our and our tenant’s or operator’s business results of operations and financial condition further if widespread default or nonpayment of outstanding obligations from a large number of tenants or operators occurs at a time when terminating such agreement or replacing such tenants or operators may be extremely difficult or impossible including as a result of the covid19 pandemic we may elect instead to amend such agreements with such tenants or operators however such amendment may be on terms that are less favorable to us than the original agreement and may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

our senior housing tenants and our shop segment under a ridea structure also rely on reimbursements from governmental programs for a portion of the revenues from certain properties changes in reimbursement policies and other governmental regulation such as potential changes to the patient protection and affordable care act along with the health care and education reconciliation act of 2010 the “affordable care act” that may result from actions by congress or executive orders may result in reductions in our tenants’ revenues or in our revenues from our ridea structures operations and cash flows and affect our tenants’ ability to meet their obligations to us or our financial performance through a ridea structure in addition failure to comply with reimbursement regulations or other laws applicable to healthcare providers could result in penalties fines litigation costs lost revenue or other consequences which could adversely impact our tenants’ ability to make contractual rent payments to us under a triplenet lease or our cash flows from operations under a ridea structure 

revenues of our senior housing tenants and our shop segment under a ridea structure are also dependent on a number of other factors including licensed bed capacity occupancy the healthcare needs of residents the rate of reimbursement the income and assets of seniors in the regions in which we own properties and social and environmental factors for example due to generally increased vulnerability to illness covid19 has resulted in and another epidemic or pandemic a severe flu season or any other widespread illness could result in early moveouts or delayed moveins during quarantine periods or during periods when actual or perceived risks of such illnesses are heightened which have and could continue to reduce our operators’ revenues additionally new and evolving payor and provider programs in the united states including but not limited to medicare advantage dual eligible accountable care organizations bundled payments and other valuebased reimbursement arrangements have resulted in reduced reimbursement rates average length of stay and average daily census particularly for higher acuity patients if our tenants fail to maintain revenues sufficient to meet their financial obligations to us or if our operators under a ridea structure underperform our business results of operations and financial condition would be materially adversely affected 

our tenants and operators have and may continue to seek to offset losses by obtaining funds under the recently adopted coronavirus aid relief and economic security act “cares act” or other similar legislative initiatives at the state and local level receipt of these funds is subject to a detailed application and approval process and in some cases entails operating restrictions it is indeterminable when or if these government funds will ultimately be received by our tenants and operators or whether these funds may materially offset the cash flow disruptions experienced by them if they are unable to obtain these funds within a reasonable time period or at all or the conditions precedent to receiving these funds are overly burdensome or not feasible it may substantially affect their ability to make payments or perform their obligations when due to us 

increased competition operating costs and market changes may affect the ability of some of our tenants operators and borrowers to meet their financial and other contractual obligations to us 

occupancy levels at and rental income from our properties are dependent on our ability and the ability of our tenants operators and borrowers to compete with other tenants and operators on a number of different levels including the quality of care provided reputation the physical appearance of a property price the range of services offered family preference alternatives for healthcare delivery the supply of competing properties physicians staff referral sources location and the size and demographics of the population in the surrounding area in addition our tenants operators and borrowers face an increasingly competitive labor market which has been compounded by the covid19 pandemic an inability to attract and retain trained personnel could negatively impact the ability of our tenants operators and borrowers to meet their obligations to us a shortage of care givers or other trained personnel union activities minimum wage laws or general inflationary pressures on wages may force tenants operators and borrowers to enhance pay and benefits packages to compete effectively for skilled personnel or to use more expensive contract personnel but they may be unable to offset these added costs by increasing the rates charged to residents any increase in labor costs and other property operating expenses or any failure by our tenants operators or borrowers to attract and retain qualified personnel could adversely affect our cash flow and have a materially adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

our tenants operators and borrowers also compete with numerous other companies providing similar healthcare services or alternatives such as home health agencies life care at home communitybased service programs retirement communities and convalescent centers this competition overdevelopment in some markets in which we invest covid19 outbreaks or the negative public perception that such outbreak may occur has caused the occupancy rate of unstabilized buildings to slow or decline and the monthly rate that some unstabilized properties were able to obtain for their services to decrease our tenants operators and borrowers may be unable to achieve and maintain occupancy and rate levels and to manage their expenses in a way that will enable them to meet all of their obligations to us further many competing companies may have resources and attributes that are superior to those of our tenants operators and borrowers which may also allow them to better withstand the impact of covid19 or other competitive pressures our tenants operators and borrowers may encounter increased competition that could limit their ability to maintain or attract residents and employees or expand their businesses or to manage their expenses which could materially adversely affect their ability to meet their financial and other contractual obligations to us potentially decreasing our revenues impairing our assets andor increasing collection and dispute costs 

financial deterioration insolvency or bankruptcy of one or more of our major tenants operators or borrowers could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

a downturn in any of our tenants’ operators’ or borrowers’ businesses including ongoing downturns due to the covid19 pandemic has led and could continue to lead to voluntary or involuntary bankruptcy or similar insolvency proceedings including but not limited to assignment for the benefit of creditors liquidation or windingup bankruptcy and insolvency laws afford certain rights to a defaulting tenant operator or borrower that has filed for bankruptcy or reorganization that may render certain of our remedies unenforceable or at the least delay our ability to pursue such remedies and realize any related recoveries 

a debtor has the right to assume or to assume and assign to a third party or to reject its executory contracts and unexpired leases in a bankruptcy proceeding if a debtor were to reject its leases with us obligations under such rejected leases would cease the claim against the rejecting debtor would be an unsecured claim which would be limited by the statutory cap set forth in the us bankruptcy code this statutory cap may be substantially less than the remaining rent actually owed under the lease in addition a debtor may also assert in bankruptcy proceedings that leases should be recharacterized as financing agreements which could result in our being deemed a lender instead of a landlord a lender’s rights and remedies as compared to a landlord’s generally are materially less favorable and our rights as a lender may be subordinated to other creditors’ rights 

furthermore the automatic stay provisions of the us bankruptcy code would preclude us from enforcing our remedies unless we first obtain relief from the court having jurisdiction over the bankruptcy case this would effectively limit or delay our ability to collect unpaid rent or interest payments and we may ultimately not receive any payment at all in addition we would likely be required to fund certain expenses and obligations eg real estate taxes insurance debt costs and maintenance expenses to preserve the value of our properties avoid the imposition of liens on our properties or transition our properties to a new tenant or operator additionally we lease many of our properties to healthcare providers who provide longterm custodial care to the elderly evicting operators for failure to pay rent while the property is occupied typically involves specific procedural or regulatory requirements and may not be successful even if eviction is possible we may determine not to do so due to reputational or other risks bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings typically also result in increased costs to the operator significant management distraction and performance declines 

if we are unable to transition affected properties they would likely experience prolonged operational disruption leading to lower occupancy rates and further depressed revenues publicity about the operator’s financial condition and insolvency proceeds may also negatively impact their and our reputations decreasing customer demand and revenues any or all of these risks could have a material adverse effect on our revenues results of operations and cash flows these risks would be magnified where we lease multiple properties to a single operator under a master lease as an operator failure or default under a master lease would expose us to these risks across multiple properties 

we depend on investments in the healthcare property sector making our profitability more vulnerable to a downturn or slowdown in that specific sector than if we were investing in multiple industries 

we concentrate our investments in the healthcare property sector a downturn or slowdown in the healthcare property sector such as the ongoing covid19 downturn has had and may continue to have a greater adverse impact on our business than if we had investments in multiple industries and could negatively impact the ability of our tenants operators and borrowers to meet their obligations to us as well as the ability to maintain historical rental and occupancy rates which would have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations in addition such downturns have had and could continue to have a material adverse effect on the value of our properties and our ability to sell properties at prices or on terms acceptable or favorable to us 

in addition we are exposed to the risks inherent in concentrating our investments in real estate our real estate investments are relatively illiquid due to i restrictions on our ability to sell properties under applicable reit tax laws ii other taxrelated considerations iii regulatory hurdles and iv market conditions as a result we may be unable to recognize full value for any property that we seek to sell for liquidity reasons our inability to timely respond to investment performance changes could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

we may have difficulty identifying and securing replacement tenants or operators and we may be required to incur substantial renovation or tenant improvement costs to make our properties suitable for them 

our tenants may not renew existing leases and our operators may not renew their management agreements beyond their current terms if we or our tenants or operators terminate or do not renew the leases or management agreements for our properties we would attempt to reposition those properties with another tenant or operator these difficulties may be exacerbated by the covid19 pandemic as new operators or tenants may not be willing to take on the increased exposure especially while active cases are occurring healthcare properties are typically highly customized and the improvements generally required to conform a property to healthcare use are costly and at times tenantspecific and are typically subject to regulatory requirements a new or replacement tenant or operator may require different features in a property depending on that tenant’s or operator’s particular business in addition infrastructure improvements for life science properties typically are significantly more costly than improvements to other property types due to the highly specialized nature of the properties and the greater lease square footage often required by life science tenants therefore if a current tenant or operator is unable to pay rent andor vacates a property we may incur substantial expenditures to modify a property and experience delays before we are able to secure another tenant or operator or to accommodate multiple tenants or operators which may have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

additionally we may fail to identify suitable replacements or enter into leases management agreements or other arrangements with new tenants or operators on a timely basis or on terms as favorable to us as our current leases if at all furthermore during transition periods to new tenants or operators we anticipate that the attention of existing tenants or operators will be diverted from the performance of the properties and there may also be increased errors and delays as a result of the transition which would cause the financial and operational performance at these properties to decline following a decline in performance we may not be able to rehabilitate the property to previous performance levels which would adversely impact our results of operations we also may be required to fund certain expenses and obligations such as real estate taxes debt costs and maintenance expenses to preserve the value of and avoid the imposition of liens on our properties while they are being repositioned in addition we may incur certain obligations and liabilities including obligations to indemnify the replacement tenant or operator which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

property development and redevelopment risks can render a project less profitable or unprofitable and under certain circumstances prevent completion of development or redevelopment activities once undertaken 

largescale groundup healthcare property development presents additional risks for us including risks that 

• a development opportunity may be abandoned after expending significant resources resulting in the loss of deposits or failure to recover expenses already incurred 

• the development and construction costs of a project exceed original estimates due to increased interest rates higher costs relating to materials transportation labor leasing negligent construction or construction defects damage vandalism or accidents among others and increased costs as a result of covid19 related delays andor pressure on supply chains which could make the completion of the development project less profitable 

• the project may not be completed on schedule as a result of a variety of factors that are beyond our control including natural disasters and other catastrophic events health crises or other pandemics such as the covid19 pandemic and related restrictions on development and redevelopment activities labor conditions material shortages regulatory hurdles including the ability to obtain necessary zoning or land use permits civil unrest and acts of war or terrorism which result in increases in construction costs and debt service expenses or provide tenants or operators with the right to terminate preconstruction leases and 

• demand for the new project may decrease prior to completion due to competition or otherwise and occupancy rates and rents at a newly completed property may not meet expected levels and could be insufficient to make the property profitable 

any of the foregoing risks could result in not achieving our expected return on investment and have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

changes within the life science industry may adversely impact our revenues and results of operations 

our life science investments could be adversely affected if the life science industry is impacted by an economic financial or banking crisis a health crisis such as the covid19 pandemic or if the life science industry migrates from the us to other countries or to areas outside of primary life science markets in south san francisco california san diego california and greater boston massachusetts our ability to negotiate contractual rent escalations on future leases and to achieve increases in rental rates will depend upon market conditions and the demand for life science properties at the time the leases are negotiated and the increases are proposed if economic financial or industry conditions adversely affect our life science tenants we may not be able to lease or release our properties in a timely manner or at favorable rates which would negatively impact our revenues and results of operations because infrastructure improvements for life science properties typically are significantly more costly than improvements to other property types due to the highly specialized nature of the properties and life science tenants typically require greater lease square footage relative to medical office tenants repositioning efforts would have a disproportionate adverse effect on our life science segment performance 

future mergers or consolidations of life science entities could reduce the amount of rentable square footage requirements of our client tenants and prospective client tenants which may adversely impact our revenues from lease payments and results of operations 

our tenants in the life science industry face high levels of regulation funding requirements expense and uncertainty 

life science tenants particularly those involved in developing and marketing pharmaceutical products are subject to certain risks including the following 

• significant funding for the research development clinical testing manufacture and commercialization of their products and technologies as well as to fund their obligations including rent payments due to us and our tenants’ ability to raise capital depends on the viability of their products and technologies their financial and operating condition and outlook and the overall financial banking and economic environment if venture capital firms private investors the public markets companies in the life science industry the government or other sources of funding are difficult to obtain or unavailable to support our tenants’ activities including as a result of general economic conditions adverse market conditions or government shutdowns that limit our tenants’ ability to raise capital such as those resulting from the current covid19 pandemic a tenant’s business would be adversely affected or fail 

• the research development clinical testing manufacture and marketing of some of our tenants’ products require federal state and foreign regulatory approvals which may be costly or difficult to obtain may take several years and be subject to delay including delays brought on by the covid19 pandemic may not be obtained at all require validation through clinical trials that may face delays or difficulties resulting from the covid19 pandemic or otherwise require the use of substantial resources and may often be unpredictable 

• even after regulatory approval and market acceptance the product may still present significant regulatory and liability risks including among others the possible later discovery of safety concerns and other defects and potential loss of approvals competition from new products and the expiration of patent protection for the product 

• our tenants with marketable products may be adversely affected by healthcare reform and the reimbursement policies of government or private healthcare payors 

• our tenants with marketable products may be unable to successfully manufacture their drugs economically 

• our tenants depend on the commercial success of certain products which may be reliant on the efficacy of the product as well as acceptance among doctors and patients negative publicity or negative results or safety signals from the clinical trials of competitors may reduce demand or prompt regulatory actions and 

• our tenants may be unable to adapt to the rapid technological advances in the industry and to adequately protect their intellectual property under patent copyright or trade secret laws and defend against thirdparty claims of intellectual property violations 

if our tenants’ businesses are adversely affected they may fail to make their rent payments to us which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

the hospitals on whose campuses our mobs are located and their affiliated healthcare systems could fail to remain competitive or financially viable which could adversely impact their ability to attract physicians and physician groups to our mobs and our other properties that serve the healthcare industry 

the viability of hospitals depends on factors such as i the quality and mix of healthcare services provided ii competition for patients and physicians iii demographic trends in the surrounding community iv market position and v growth potential as well as the ability of the affiliated healthcare systems to provide economies of scale and access to capital in addition most hospitals are experiencing a significant reduction in revenue due to decreased volumes as well as increased costs as they provide care capacity for potential covid19 patients if a hospital whose campus is located near one of our mobs is unable to meet its financial obligations and if an affiliated healthcare system is unable to support that hospital or goes bankrupt the hospital may not be able to compete successfully or could be forced to close or relocate which could adversely impact its ability to attract physicians and other healthcarerelated users because we rely on our proximity to and affiliations with these hospitals to create tenant demand for space in our mobs their inability to remain competitive or financially viable or to attract physicians and physician groups could adversely affect our mob operations and have a material adverse effect on us 

in addition changes to or replacement of the affordable care act and related regulations could result in significant changes to the scope of insurance coverage and reimbursement policies which could put negative pressure on the operations and revenues of our mobs 

we may be unable to maintain or expand our existing and future hospital and health system client relationships 

we invest significant time in developing relationships with both new and existing hospital and health system clients if we fail to maintain these relationships including through a lack of responsiveness failure to adapt to the current market or employment of individuals with inadequate experience our reputation and relationships will be harmed and we may lose business to competitors which could have a material adverse effect on us 

economic and other conditions that negatively affect geographic areas from which a greater percentage of our revenue is recognized could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

we are subject to increased exposure to adverse conditions affecting california including i downturns in local economies and increases in unemployment rates ii changes in local real estate conditions including increases in real estate taxes iii increased competition iv decreased demand v changes in statespecific legislation and vi local climate events and natural disasters and other catastrophic events such as health pandemics including the covid19 pandemic in california and the resulting statewide shutdown earthquakes windstorms flooding wildfires and mudslides these risks could significantly disrupt our businesses in the region harm our ability to compete effectively result in increased costs and divert management attention any or all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

in addition if significant changes in the climate occur in areas where we own property this could result in physical damage to or a decrease in demand for properties located in these areas or affected by these conditions if changes in the climate have material effects such as property destruction or occur for extended periods this could have a material adverse effect on business results of operations and financial condition in addition changes in federal state and local legislation and regulation on climate change could require increased capital expenditures to improve the energy efficiency of our existing properties and could also cause increased costs for our new developments without a corresponding increase in revenue 

uninsured or underinsured losses could result in a significant loss of capital invested in a property lower than expected future revenues and unanticipated expense 

our insurance coverage does not include damages from business interruptions loss of revenue or earnings or any related effects caused by health pandemics including the covid19 pandemic we anticipate incurring significant outofpocket costs associated with legal proceedings or other claims from residents and patients at our properties that relate to the covid19 pandemic 

generally insurance coverage for health pandemics has not previously been readily available and if and when it does become available may not be on commercially reasonable terms further even if such coverage is available on commercially reasonable terms we cannot assure you that we would receive insurance proceeds that will compensate us fully for our liabilities costs and expenses in the event of a health pandemic in addition a large number of our properties are located in areas exposed to earthquake windstorm flood and other common natural disasters in particular a significant portion of our life science development projects and approximately 70 of our life science portfolio based on gross asset value as of december 31 2020 was concentrated in california which is known to be subject to earthquakes wildfires and other natural disasters while we purchase insurance coverage for earthquake fire windstorm flood and other natural disasters and we may be unable to purchase the limits and terms we desire on a commercially reasonable basis in addition there are certain exposures for which we do not purchase insurance because we do not believe it is economically feasible to do so or there is no viable insurance market we maintain earthquake insurance for our properties that are located in the vicinity of active earthquake zones in amounts and with deductibles we believe are commercially reasonable because of our significant concentration in the seismically active regions of south san francisco california and san diego california a damaging earthquake in these areas could significantly impact multiple properties which may amount to a significant portion of our life science portfolio as a result aggregate deductible amounts may be material and our insurance coverage may be materially insufficient to cover our losses either of which would adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

if one of our properties experiences a loss that is uninsured or that exceeds policy coverage limits we could lose our investment in the damaged property as well as the anticipated future cash flows from such property if the damaged property is subject to recourse indebtedness we could continue to be liable for the indebtedness even if the property is irreparably damaged in addition even if damage to our properties is covered by insurance a disruption of business caused by a casualty event may result in loss of revenues for us any business interruption insurance may not fully compensate the lender or us for such loss of revenue our shop operators also face various forms of classaction lawsuits from time to time such as wage and hour and consumer rights actions which generally are not covered by insurance these class actions could result in significant defense costs as well as settlements or verdicts that materially decrease anticipated revenues from a property and can result in the loss of a portion or all of our invested capital 

our use of joint ventures may limit our flexibility with jointly owned investments 

we have and may continue to develop andor acquire properties in joint ventures with other persons or entities when circumstances warrant the use of these structures our participation in joint ventures is subject to risks that may not be present with other methods of ownership including 

• our joint venture partners could have investment and financing goals that are inconsistent with our objectives including the timing terms and strategies for any investments and what levels of debt to incur or carry 

• we could experience an impasse on certain decisions because we do not have sole decisionmaking authority which could require us to expend additional resources on resolving such impasses or potential disputes including litigation or arbitration 

• our joint venture partners may have competing interests in our markets that could create conflicts of interest 

• our ability to transfer our interest in a joint venture to a third party may be restricted and the market for our interest may be limited andor valued lower than fair market value 

• our joint venture partners may be structured differently than us for tax purposes and this could create conflicts of interest and risks to our reit status and 

• our joint venture partners might become insolvent fail to fund their share of required capital contributions or fail to fulfill their obligations as a joint venture partner which may require us to infuse our own capital into the venture on behalf of the partner despite other competing uses for such capital 

with respect to our joint ventures we may be limited in our ability to control or influence operations and in our ability to exit or transfer our interest in the joint venture to a third party as a result we may not receive full value for our ownership interest if we tried to sell it to a third party in addition in some instances we andor our joint venture partner will have the right to cause us to sell our interest or acquire our partner’s interest at a time when we otherwise would not have initiated such a transaction our ability to acquire our partner’s interest will be limited if we do not have sufficient cash available borrowing capacity or other capital resources this would require us to sell our interest in the joint venture when we would otherwise prefer to retain it any of the foregoing risks could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

we have now and may have in the future contingent rent provisions andor rent escalators based on the consumer price index which could hinder our profitability and growth 

we derive a significant portion of our revenues from leasing properties pursuant to leases that generally provide for fixed rental rates subject to annual escalations under certain leases a portion of the tenant’s rental payment to us is based on the property’s revenues ie contingent rent if as a result of weak economic conditions or other factors that may be outside of our control the property’s revenue declines our rental revenues would decrease and our results of operations could be materially adversely affected additionally some of our leases provide that annual rent is modified based on changes in the consumer price index or other thresholds ie contingent rent escalators if the consumer price index does not increase or other applicable thresholds are not met rental rates may not increase as anticipated or at all which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations furthermore if strong economic conditions result in significant increases in the consumer price index but the escalations under our leases with contingent rent escalators are capped our growth and profitability also may be limited 

competition may make it difficult to identify and purchase or develop suitable healthcare properties to grow our investment portfolio to finance acquisitions on favorable terms or to retain or attract tenants and operators 

we face significant competition from other reits investment companies private equity and hedge fund investors sovereign funds healthcare operators lenders developers and other institutional investors some of whom may have greater resources and lower costs of capital than we do increased competition makes it more challenging for us to identify and successfully capitalize on opportunities that meet our business goals and could improve the bargaining power of property owners seeking to sell thereby impeding our investment acquisition and development activities similarly our properties face competition for tenants and operators from other properties in the same market which may affect our ability to attract and retain tenants and operators or may reduce the rents we are able to charge if we cannot capitalize on our development pipeline identify and purchase a sufficient quantity of healthcare properties at favorable prices finance acquisitions on commercially favorable terms or attract and retain profitable tenants and operators our business results of operations and financial condition may be materially adversely affected 

from time to time we have made and we may seek to make one or more material acquisitions which may involve the expenditure of significant funds 

we regularly review potential transactions in order to maximize stockholder value our review process may require significant management attention and a potential transaction could be abandoned or rejected by us or the other parties involved after we expend significant resources and time in addition future acquisitions may require the issuance of securities the incurrence of debt assumption of contingent liabilities or incurrence of significant expenditures each of which could materially adversely impact our business financial condition or results of operations in addition the financing required for acquisitions may not be available on commercially favorable terms or at all 

if we are unable to successfully integrate our acquisitions our business results of operations and financial condition may be materially adversely affected 

successful integration of acquired companies depends primarily on our ability to consolidate operations systems procedures properties and personnel and to eliminate redundancies and reduce costs we may encounter difficulties in these integrations potential difficulties associated with acquisitions include i our ability to effectively monitor and manage our expanded portfolio of properties ii the loss of key employees iii the disruption of our ongoing business or that of the acquired entity iv possible inconsistencies in standards controls procedures and policies and v the assumption of unexpected liabilities including 

• liabilities relating to the cleanup or remediation of undisclosed environmental conditions 

• unasserted claims of vendors residents patients or other persons dealing with the seller 

• liabilities claims and litigation whether or not incurred in the ordinary course of business relating to periods prior to our acquisition 

• claims for indemnification by general partners directors officers and others indemnified by the seller 

• claims for return of government reimbursement payments and 

• liabilities for taxes relating to periods prior to our acquisition 

in addition acquired companies and their properties may fail to perform as expected including in respect of estimated cost savings inaccurate assumptions regarding future rental or occupancy rates could result in overly optimistic estimates of future revenues similarly we may underestimate future operating expenses or the costs necessary to bring properties up to standards established for their intended use or for property improvements 

if we have difficulties with any of these areas or if we later discover additional liabilities or experience unforeseen costs relating to our acquired companies we may not achieve the anticipated economic benefits from our acquisitions and this may have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

our tenants operators and borrowers face litigation and may experience rising liability and insurance costs 

our tenants operators and borrowers are from time to time parties to litigation including related to the quality of care at healthcare properties the effect of litigation may materially increase the costs incurred by our tenants operators and borrowers for monitoring and reporting quality of care compliance which under a ridea structure would be borne by us in addition their cost of professional liability medical malpractice property business interruption and insurance policies that may provide partial coverage for covid19 and other environmental or infectious disease outbreaks epidemics and pandemics can be significant and may increase or not be available at a reasonable cost or at all cost increases could cause our tenants and borrowers to be unable to make their lease or mortgage payments or fail to purchase the appropriate liability and malpractice insurance or cause our borrowers to be unable to meet their obligations to us potentially decreasing our revenues and increasing our collection and litigation costs furthermore with respect to our senior housing properties operated in ridea structures we directly bear the costs of any such increases in litigation monitoring reporting and insurance due to our direct exposure to the cash flows of such properties 

in addition as a result of our ownership of healthcare properties we may be named as a defendant in lawsuits arising from the alleged actions of our tenants or operators with respect to our triplenet leases our tenants generally have agreed to indemnify us for various claims litigation and liabilities in connection with their leasing and operation of our triplenet leased properties 

with respect to our ridea structured properties we are responsible for these claims litigation and liabilities with limited indemnification rights against our operator typically based on the gross negligence or willful misconduct by the operator although our leases provide us with certain information rights with respect to our tenants one or more of our tenants may be or become party to pending litigation or investigation to which we are unaware or do not have a right to participate or evaluate in such cases we would be unable to determine the potential impact of such litigation or investigation on our tenants or our business or results moreover negative publicity of any of our operators’ or tenants’ litigation other legal proceedings or investigations may also negatively impact their and our reputation resulting in lower customer demand and revenues which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flow 

we may be unable to successfully foreclose on the collateral securing our real estaterelated loans and even if we are successful in our foreclosure efforts we may be unable to successfully operate occupy or reposition the underlying real estate which may adversely affect our ability to recover our investments 

if a tenant or operator defaults under one of our mortgages or mezzanine loans we may have to foreclose on the loan or take additional actions including but not limited to acquiring title to the collateral via statutory or judicial foreclosure or commencing collection litigation we may determine that substantial improvements or repairs to the property are necessary in order to maximize the property’s investment potential in some cases because our collateral consists of the equity interests in an entity that directly or indirectly owns the applicable real property or interests in other operating properties we may not have full recourse with respect to assets of that entity or that entity may have incurred unexpected liabilities which would preclude us from fully recovering our investment tenants operators or borrowers may contest enforcement of foreclosure or other remedies seek bankruptcy protection against our exercise of enforcement or other remedies andor bring claims for lender liability in response to actions to enforce mortgage obligations foreclosure or collections related costs high loantovalue ratios or declines in the value of the property may prevent us from realizing an amount equal to our mortgage or mezzanine loan balance upon foreclosure or conclusion of litigation and we may be required to record a valuation allowance for such losses even if we are able to successfully foreclose on the collateral securing our real estaterelated loans we may inherit properties for which we may be unable to expeditiously secure tenants or operators if at all or we may acquire equity interests that we are unable to immediately resell or otherwise liquidate due to limitations under the securities laws either of which would adversely affect our ability to fully recover our investment 

risks related to the regulatory environment 



laws or regulations prohibiting eviction of our tenants even on a temporary basis could have a material adverse effect on our revenues if our tenants fail to make their contractual rent payments to us 

various federal state and local governments have enacted and may continue to enact laws regulations and moratoriums or take other actions which could limit our ability to evict tenants until such laws regulations or moratoriums are reversed or lifted in particular many state and local governments have implemented eviction moratoriums as a result of the covid19 pandemic which generally apply to both residential and commercial tenants although many of these moratoriums are expected to be temporary in nature they may be extended for a significant period of time until the covid19 pandemic subsides although we generally have arrangements and other agreements that give us the right under specified circumstances to terminate a lease or evict a tenant for nonpayment of contractual rent such laws regulations and moratoriums will generally prohibit our ability to begin eviction proceedings even where no rent or only partial rent is being paid for so long as such law regulation or moratorium remains in effect further under current laws and regulations eviction proceedings for delinquent tenants are already costly and timeconsuming and if there are existing backlogs or backlogs develop in courts due to higher than normal eviction proceedings whether or not due to an increase in eviction proceedings after the covid19 pandemic we may incur significant costs and it may take a significant amount of time to ultimately evict any tenant who is not meeting their contractual rent obligations if we are restricted delayed or prohibited from evicting tenants for failing to make contractual rent payments our business results of operations and financial condition may be materially adversely impacted 

tenants and operators that fail to comply with federal state local and international laws and regulations including resident health and safety requirements as well as licensure certification and inspection requirements may cease to operate or be unable to meet their financial and other contractual obligations to us 

our tenants operators and borrowers are subject to or impacted by extensive frequently changing federal state and local and laws and regulations see “item 1businessgovernment regulation licensing and enforcementhealthcare licensure and certificate of need” for a discussion of such laws and regulations our tenants’ operators’ or borrowers’ failure to comply with any of these laws regulations or requirements could result in i loss of accreditation denial of reimbursement ii imposition of fines suspension or decertification from government healthcare programs iii civil liability and iv in certain instances criminal penalties loss of license or closure of the property andor the incurrence of considerable costs arising from an investigation or regulatory action which may have an adverse effect on properties that we own and lease to a third party tenant that we own and operate through a ridea structure or on which we hold a mortgage and therefore may materially adversely impact us 

required regulatory approvals can delay or prohibit transfers of our healthcare properties 

transfers of healthcare properties to successor tenants or operators are typically subject to regulatory approvals or ratifications including but not limited to change of ownership approvals and medicare and medicaid provider agreements that are not required for transfers of other types of commercial operations and other types of real estate the replacement of any tenant or operator could be delayed by the regulatory approval process of any federal state or local government agency necessary for the transfer of the property or the replacement of the operator licensed to manage the property during which time the property may experience performance declines the covid19 pandemic may materially delay necessary approvals thereby lengthening the period of performance deterioration if we are unable to find a suitable replacement tenant or operator upon favorable terms or at all we may take possession of a property which could expose us to successor liability require us to indemnify subsequent operators to whom we transfer the operating rights and licenses or require us to spend substantial time and funds to preserve the value of the property and adapt the property to other uses all of which could have a material adverse effect of our business results of operations and financial condition 

compliance with the americans with disabilities act and fire safety and other regulations may require us to make expenditures that adversely affect our cash flows 

our properties must comply with applicable ada and any similar state and local laws this may require removal of barriers to access by persons with disabilities in public areas of our properties noncompliance could result in the incurrence of additional costs associated with bringing the properties into compliance the imposition of fines or an award of damages to private litigants in individual lawsuits or as part of a class action while the tenants to whom we lease our properties are obligated to comply with the ada and similar state and local provisions and typically under tenant leases are obligated to cover costs associated with compliance if required changes involve greater expenditures than anticipated or if the changes must be made on a more accelerated basis than anticipated the ability of these tenants to cover costs could be adversely affected as a result we could be required to expend funds to comply with the provisions of the ada and similar state and local laws on behalf of tenants which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition additionally with respect to our shop properties under ridea structures we are ultimately responsible for such litigation and compliance costs 

in addition we are required to operate our properties in compliance with fire and safety regulations building codes and other land use regulations new and revised regulations and codes may be adopted by governmental agencies and bodies and become applicable to our properties for example new safety laws for senior housing properties were adopted following the particularly damaging 2018 hurricane season compliance could require substantial capital expenditures and may restrict our ability to renovate our properties these expenditures and restrictions could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and cash flows 

the requirements of or changes to governmental reimbursement programs such as medicare or medicaid may adversely affect our tenants’ operators’ and borrowers’ ability to meet their financial and other contractual obligations to us 

certain of our tenants operators and borrowers are affected directly or indirectly by a complex set of federal state and local laws and regulations pertaining to governmental reimbursement programs including the recently enacted cares act and other similar relief legislation enacted as a result of the covid19 pandemic these laws and regulations are subject to frequent and substantial changes that are sometimes applied retroactively see “item 1businessgovernment regulation licensing and enforcement” for example to the extent that our tenants operators or borrowers receive a significant portion of their revenues from governmental payors primarily medicare and medicaid they are generally subject to among other things 

• statutory and regulatory changes 

• retroactive rate adjustments 

• recovery of program overpayments or setoffs 

• federal state and local litigation and enforcement actions 

• administrative proceedings 

• policy interpretations 

• payment or other delays by fiscal intermediaries or carriers 

• government funding restrictions at a program level or with respect to specific properties 

• reduced reimbursement rates under managed care contracts 

• interruption or delays in payments due to any ongoing governmental investigations and audits at such properties and 

• reputational harm of publicly disclosed enforcement actions audits or investigations related to billing and reimbursements 

the failure to comply with the extensive laws regulations and other requirements applicable to their business and the operation of our properties could result in among other challenges i becoming ineligible to receive reimbursement from governmental reimbursement programs including under the cares act ii becoming subject to prepayment reviews or claims for overpayments iii bans on admissions of new patients or residents iv civil or criminal penalties and v significant operational changes including requirements to increase staffing or the scope of care given to residents these laws and regulations are enforced by a variety of federal state and local agencies and can also be enforced by private litigants through among other things federal and state false claims acts which allow private litigants to bring qui tam or “whistleblower” actions 

we are unable to predict future changes to or interpretations of federal state and local statutes and regulations including the medicare and medicaid statutes and regulations or the intensity of enforcement efforts with respect to such statutes and regulations any changes in the regulatory framework or the intensity or extent of governmental or private enforcement actions could have a material adverse effect on our tenants and operators 

sometimes governmental payors freeze or reduce payments to healthcare providers or provide annual reimbursement rate increases that are smaller than expected due to budgetary and other pressures in addition the federal government periodically makes changes in the statutes and regulations relating to medicare and medicaid reimbursement that may impact state reimbursement programs particularly medicaid reimbursement and managed care payments we cannot make any assessment as to the ultimate timing or the effect that any future changes may have on our tenants’ operators’ and borrowers’ costs of doing business and on the amount of reimbursement by government and other thirdparty payors the failure of any of our tenants operators or borrowers to comply with these laws and regulations and significant limits on the scope of services reimbursed reductions in reimbursement rates and fees or increases in provider or similar types of taxes could materially adversely affect their ability to meet their financial and contractual obligations to us 

furthermore executive orders and legislation may amend the affordable care act and related regulations in whole or in part we also anticipate that congress state legislatures and thirdparty payors may continue to review and assess alternative healthcare delivery and payment systems and may propose and adopt legislation or policy changes or implementations effecting additional fundamental changes in the healthcare system for example the department of health and human services has focused on tying medicare payments to quality or value through alternative payment models which generally aim to make providers attentive to the total costs of treatments medicare no longer reimburses hospitals for care related to certain preventable adverse events and imposes payment reductions on hospitals for preventable readmissions these punitive approaches could be expanded to additional types of providers in the future additionally the patient driven payment model utilized by the centers for medicare and medicaid services to calculate reimbursement rates for patients in skilled nursing properties could result in decreases in payments to our operators and tenants or increase our operators’ and tenants’ costs if any such changes significantly and adversely affect our tenants’ profitability they could in turn negatively affect our tenants’ ability and willingness to comply with the terms of their leases with us andor renew their leases with us upon expiration which could impact our business prospects financial condition or results of operations 

legislation to address federal government operations and administration decisions affecting the centers for medicare and medicaid services could have a material adverse effect on our tenants’ operators’ and borrowers’ liquidity financial condition or results of operations 

congressional consideration of legislation pertaining to the federal debt ceiling the affordable care act tax reform and entitlement programs including reimbursement rates for physicians could have a material adverse effect on our tenants’ operators’ and borrowers’ liquidity financial condition or results of operations in particular reduced funding for entitlement programs such as medicare and medicaid would result in increased costs and fees for programs such as medicare advantage plans and additional reductions in reimbursements to providers amendments the affordable care act in whole or in part and decisions by the centers for medicare and medicaid services could impact the delivery of services and benefits under medicare medicaid or medicare advantage plans and could affect our tenants and operators and the manner in which they are reimbursed by such programs any such material adverse effect on our tenants operators or borrowers could adversely affect their ability to satisfy their obligations to us and could have a material adverse effect on us 

our participation in the cares act provider relief program and other covid19related stimulus and relief programs could subject us to disruptive government and financial audits and investigations regulatory enforcement actions civil litigation and other claims penalties and liabilities 

under the cares act and subsequent relief legislation congress has allocated more than 178 billion to eligible hospitals physicians and other health care providers through the public health and social services emergency fund the “provider relief fund” or “prf” the us department of health and human services “hhs” has distributed prf grants through various general and targeted distributions including certain distributions that were paid automatically to providers and others that required providers submit requested data or applications we and our senior housing operators have received funds from several prf distributions both via automatic payments and also as a result of applications we submitted for prf funds 

prf funds are intended to reimburse eligible providers for unreimbursed health carerelated expenses and lost revenues attributable to covid19 and must be used only to prevent prepare for or respond to covid19 prf funds received under certain targeted distributions including the nursing home infection control distribution are further limited to specific uses additionally the prf program imposes certain distributionspecific eligibility criteria and requires recipients comply with various terms and conditions hhs has stated that compliance with prf program terms and conditions is material to hhs’s decision to disburse prf payments to recipients prf program terms and conditions include limitations and requirements governing use of prf funds implementation of controls retention of records relating to prf funds audit and reporting to governmental authorities and other prf program requirements prf regulatory guidance regarding eligibility use of funds audit reporting and other prf terms and conditions continues to evolve and there is a high degree of uncertainty surrounding interpretation and implementation particularly among more complex corporate transactional and contractual relationships including ridea structures and for organizations with multiple recipient subsidiaries in addition to other various risks related to our prf program participation in light of the evolving laws and guidance related to prf there can be no assurance that prf guidance will not change in ways that adversely impacts the prf funding we receive our ability to retain prf funding or our eligibility to participate in the prf program 

changing prf program requirements could reduce the amount of prf funds we initially receive or could render us or our operators ineligible for future or previously received prf funds prf reporting obligations and monitoring and compliance efforts could impose substantial costs become overly burdensome and require significant attention from leadership disrupting our business and impeding our operations further our operators may not consistently account for prf and other relief funds which may adversely impact consistency in our reporting including among operators and across reporting periods ultimately as prf program requirements continue to evolve we may determine that we are unable to comply with certain terms and conditions or that we are no longer eligible for some or all of the prf payments we or our operators previously received if we are unable to fully comply with applicable prf terms and conditions we may be required to return some or all prf funds received and may be subject to further enforcement action 

due to our and our operators’ participation in the prf program we may be subject to government and other audits and investigations related to our receipt and use of prf funds these audits and investigations also may impose substantial costs and disruptions if the government determines that we failed to comply prf terms and conditions or related interpretative guidance applicable grant requirements or that our prf applications and submissions were defective prf funds that we or our operators have received may be subject to recoupment or further enforcement action this could occur even if our interpretation of prf program requirements was reasonable under the present or thenexisting prf guidance government audits and investigations also could result in other regulatory penalties or enforcement actions including actions under the false claims act “fca” which prohibits false claims for payments to or improper retention of overpayments from the government fca litigation could be asserted directly by the federal government or on its behalf by private litigants as “whistleblowers” even if not meritorious fca litigation could impose significant costs and result in reputational damage and a disruption of our business 

risks related to our capital structure and market conditions 



an increase in our borrowing costs could materially adversely impact our ability to refinance existing debt sell properties and conduct acquisition investment and development activities and could cause our stock price to decline 

an increase in our borrowing costs reduces the amount investors are willing to pay for our common stock because reit stocks are often perceived as highyield investments investors may perceive less relative benefit to owning reit stocks as borrowing costs increase 

additionally we have existing debt obligations that are variable rate obligations with interest and related payments that vary with the movement of certain indices if interest rates increase so would our interest costs for any variable rate debt and for new debt this increased cost would make the financing of any acquisition and development activity more costly in addition an increase in interest rates could decrease the amount third parties are willing to pay for our properties thereby limiting our ability to reposition our portfolio promptly in response to changes in economic or other conditions 

rising borrowing costs could limit our ability to refinance existing debt when it matures or cause us to pay higher interest rates upon refinancing and increase interest expense on refinanced indebtedness if our prevailing borrowing costs are higher than the interest rates of our senior notes at their maturity we will incur additional interest expense upon any replacement debt 

we manage a portion of our exposure to interest rate risk by accessing debt with staggered maturities and through the use of derivative instruments primarily interest rate swap agreements swap agreements involve risk including that counterparties may fail to honor their obligations under these arrangements that these arrangements may not be effective in reducing our exposure to interest rate changes that the amount of income we earn from hedging transactions may be limited by federal tax provisions governing reits and that these arrangements may cause us to pay higher interest rates on our debt obligations than would otherwise be the case failure to hedge effectively against interest rate risk could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

cash available for distribution to stockholders may be insufficient to make dividend distributions at expected levels and are made at the discretion of our board of directors 

decreases in cash available for distributions including decreases related to the covid19 pandemic or resulting from dispositions may result in us being unable to make dividend distributions at expected levels our failure to make distributions commensurate with market expectations would likely result in a decrease in the market price of our common stock further all distributions are made at the discretion of our board of directors in accordance with maryland law and depend on i our earnings ii our financial condition iii debt and equity capital available to us iv our expectations for future capital requirements and operating performance v restrictive covenants in our financial or other contractual arrangements including those in our credit facility agreement vi maintenance of our reit qualification vii restrictions under maryland law and viii other factors as our board of directors may deem relevant from time to time 

if access to external capital is unavailable on acceptable terms or at all it could have a material adverse effect on our ability to meet commitments as they become due or make future investments necessary to grow our business 

we be unable to fund all future capital needs including capital expenditures debt maturities and other commitments from cash retained from operations and dispositions if we are unable to obtain enough internal capital we may need to rely on external sources of capital including debt and equity financing to fulfill our capital requirements which depends upon a number of factors some of which we have little or no control over including but not limited to 

• general availability of capital including less favorable terms rising interest rates and increased borrowing costs 

• the market price of the shares of our equity securities and the credit ratings of our debt and any preferred securities we may issue 

• the market’s perception of our growth potential and our current and potential future earnings and cash distributions 

• our degree of financial leverage and operational flexibility 

• the financial integrity of our lenders which might impair their ability to meet their commitments to us or their willingness to make additional loans to us and our inability to replace the financing commitment of any such lender on favorable terms or at all 

• the stability of the market value of our properties 

• the financial performance and general market perception of our tenants and operators 

• changes in the credit ratings on us government debt securities or default or delay in payment by the united states of its obligations 

• issues facing the healthcare industry including but not limited to healthcare reform changes in government reimbursement policies and the unique challenges posed by the covid19 pandemic and 

• the performance of the national and global economies generally including the ongoing economic downturn and volatility in the financial markets as a result of the covid19 pandemic 

if access to capital is unavailable on acceptable terms or at all it could have a material adverse impact on our ability to fund operations repay or refinance our debt obligations fund dividend payments acquire properties and make the investments in development and redevelopment activities as well an capital expenditures needed to grow our business 

our level of indebtedness may increase and materially adversely affect our future operations 

our outstanding indebtedness as of december 31 2020 was approximately 630 billion we may incur additional indebtedness which may be substantial any significant additional indebtedness would likely negatively affect the credit ratings of our debt and require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow to interest and principal payments greater demands on our cash resources may reduce funds available to us to pay dividends conduct development activities make capital expenditures and acquisitions or carry out other aspects of our business strategy increased indebtedness can also make us more vulnerable to general adverse economic and industry conditions and create competitive disadvantages for us compared to other companies with comparatively lower debt levels increased future debt service obligations may limit our operational flexibility including our ability to finance or refinance our properties contribute properties to joint ventures or sell properties as needed 

covenants in our debt instruments limit our operational flexibility and breaches of these covenants could materially adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

the terms of our current secured and unsecured debt instruments require us to comply with a number of customary financial and other covenants such as maintaining leverage ratios minimum tangible net worth requirements reit status and certain levels of debt service coverage our continued ability to incur additional debt and to conduct business in general is subject to compliance with these covenants which limits our operational flexibility for example mortgages on our properties contain customary covenants such as those that limit or restrict our ability without the consent of the lender to further encumber or sell the applicable properties or to replace the applicable tenant or operator breaches of certain covenants may result in defaults under the mortgages on our properties and crossdefaults under certain of our other indebtedness even if we satisfy our payment obligations to the respective obligee covenants that limit our operational flexibility as well as defaults resulting from the breach of any of these covenants could materially adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

volatility disruption or uncertainty in the financial markets may impair our ability to raise capital obtain new financing or refinance existing obligations and fund real estate and development activities 

increased or prolonged market disruption volatility or uncertainty including disruption caused by the covid19 pandemic could materially adversely impact our ability to raise capital obtain new financing or refinance our existing obligations as they mature and fund real estate and development activities for example as a result of the potential or perceived impact of the pandemic on our business lenders and other financial institutions could require us to agree to more restrictive covenants grant liens on our assets as collateral andor accept other terms that are not commercially beneficial to us in order to obtain financing one or more of our lenders under our credit facility could refuse or fail to fund their financing commitment to us as a result of lender liquidity andor viability challenges which financing commitments we may not be able to replace on favorable terms or at all market volatility could also lead to significant uncertainty in the valuation of our investments and those of our joint ventures which may result in a substantial decrease in the value of our properties and those of our joint ventures as a result we may be unable to recover the carrying amount of such investments and the associated goodwill if any which may require us to recognize impairment charges in earnings 

risks related to other events 



we are subject to certain provisions of maryland law and our charter relating to business combinations which may prevent a transaction that may otherwise be in the interest of our stockholders 

the maryland business combination act the “mbca” provides that unless exempted a maryland corporation may not engage in business combinations including a merger consolidation share exchange or in circumstances specified in the statute an asset transfer or issuance or reclassification of equity securities with an “interested stockholder” or an affiliate of an interested stockholder for five years after the most recent date on which the interested stockholder became an interested stockholder and thereafter unless specified criteria are met an interested stockholder is generally a person owning or controlling directly or indirectly 10 or more of the voting power of the outstanding voting stock of a maryland corporation unless our board of directors takes action to exempt us from the mbca it will be applicable to business combinations between us and other persons in addition to the restrictions on business combinations contained in the mbca our charter also requires that except in certain circumstances “business combinations” including a merger or consolidation and certain asset transfers and issuances of securities with a “related person” including a beneficial owner of 10 or more of our outstanding voting stock be approved by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 90 of our outstanding voting stock these restrictions on business combinations may delay defer or prevent a change of control or other transaction even if such transaction involves a premium price for our common stock or our stockholders believe that such transaction is otherwise in their best interests 

environmental compliance costs and liabilities associated with our real estaterelated investments may be substantial and may materially impair the value of those investments 

federal state and local laws ordinances and regulations may require us as a current or previous owner of real estate to investigate and clean up certain hazardous or toxic substances or petroleum released at a property we may be held liable to a governmental entity or to third parties for property damage and for investigation and cleanup costs incurred by the third parties in connection with the contamination the costs of cleanup and remediation could be substantial in addition some environmental laws create a lien on the contaminated site in favor of the government for damages and the costs it incurs in connection with the contamination 

although we currently carry environmental insurance on our properties in an amount that we believe is commercially reasonable and generally require our tenants and operators to indemnify us for environmental liabilities they cause such liabilities could exceed the amount of our insurance the financial ability of the tenant or operator to indemnify us or the value of the contaminated property as the owner of a site we may also be held liable to third parties for damages and injuries resulting from environmental contamination emanating from the site we may also experience environmental liabilities arising from conditions not known to us the cost of defending against these claims complying with environmental regulatory requirements conducting remediation of any contaminated property or paying personal injury or other claims or fines could be substantial and could have a materially adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition in addition the presence of contamination or the failure to remediate contamination may materially adversely affect our ability to use sell or lease the property or to borrow using the property as collateral 

risks related to tax including reitrelated risks 



loss of our tax status as a reit would substantially reduce our available funds and would have materially adverse consequences for us and the value of our common stock 

qualification as a reit involves the application of numerous highly technical and complex provisions of the internal revenue code of 1986 as amended the “code” for which there are limited judicial and administrative interpretations as well as the determination of various factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control we intend to continue to operate in a manner that enables us to qualify as a reit however our qualification and taxation as a reit depend upon our ability to meet through actual annual operating results asset diversification distribution levels and diversity of stock ownership the various qualification tests imposed under the code 

for example to qualify as a reit at least 95 of our gross income in any year must be derived from qualifying sources and we must make distributions to our stockholders aggregating annually to at least 90 of our reit taxable income excluding net capital gains rents we receive from a trs in a ridea structure are treated as qualifying rents from real property for reit tax purposes only if i they are paid pursuant to a lease of a “qualified healthcare property” and ii the operator qualifies as an “eligible independent contractor” as defined in the code if either of these requirements is not satisfied then the rents will not be qualifying rents furthermore new legislation regulations administrative interpretations or court decisions could change the tax laws or interpretations of the tax laws regarding qualification as a reit or the federal income tax consequences of that qualification in a manner that is materially adverse to our stockholders accordingly there is no assurance that we have operated or will continue to operate in a manner so as to qualify or remain qualified as a reit 

if we lose our reit status we will face serious tax consequences that will substantially reduce the funds available to make payments of principal and interest on the debt securities we issue and to make distributions to stockholders if we fail to qualify as a reit 

• we will not be allowed a deduction for distributions to stockholders in computing our taxable income 

• we will be subject to corporatelevel income tax on our taxable income at regular corporate rates 

• we will be subject to increased state and local income taxes and 

• unless we are entitled to relief under relevant statutory provisions we will be disqualified from taxation as a reit for the four taxable years following the year during which we fail to qualify as a reit 

as a result of all these factors our failure to qualify as a reit could also impair our ability to expand our business and raise capital and could materially adversely affect the value of our common stock 

further changes to us federal income tax laws could materially and adversely affect us and our stockholders 

the present federal income tax treatment of reits may be modified possibly with retroactive effect by legislative judicial or administrative action at any time which could affect the federal income tax treatment of an investment in us the federal income tax rules dealing with us federal income taxation and reits are constantly under review by persons involved in the legislative process the us internal revenue service the “irs” and the us treasury department which results in statutory changes as well as frequent revisions to regulations and interpretations we cannot predict how changes in the tax laws might affect our investors or us revisions in federal tax laws and interpretations thereof could significantly and negatively affect our ability to qualify as a reit as well as the tax considerations relevant to an investment in us or could cause us to change our investments and commitments 

potential deferred and contingent tax liabilities from corporate acquisitions could limit or delay future property sales 

if during the fiveyear period beginning on the date we acquire certain companies we recognize a gain on the disposition of any property acquired then to the extent of the excess of i the fair market value of such property as of the acquisition date over ii our adjusted income tax basis in such property as of that date we will be required to pay a corporatelevel federal income tax on this gain at the highest regular corporate rate there can be no assurance that these triggering dispositions will not occur and these requirements could limit or delay future property sales in addition the irs may assert liabilities against us for corporate income taxes for taxable years prior to the time that we acquire certain companies in which case we will owe these taxes plus interest and penalties if any 

there are uncertainties relating to the calculation of nonreit tax earnings and profits “ep” in certain acquisitions which may require us to distribute ep 

in order to remain qualified as a reit we are required to distribute to our stockholders all of the accumulated nonreit ep of certain companies that we acquire prior to the close of the first taxable year in which the acquisition occurs failure to make such ep distributions would result in our disqualification as a reit the determination of the amount to be distributed in such ep distributions is a complex factual and legal determination we may have less than complete information at the time we undertake our analysis or we may interpret the applicable law differently from the irs we currently believe that we have satisfied the requirements relating to such ep distributions there are however substantial uncertainties relating to the determination of ep including the possibility that the irs could successfully assert that the taxable income of the companies acquired should be increased which would increase our nonreit ep thus we might fail to satisfy the requirement that we distribute all of our nonreit ep by the close of the first taxable year in which the acquisition occurs moreover although there are procedures available to cure a failure to distribute all of our ep we cannot now determine whether we will be able to take advantage of these procedures or the economic impact on us of doing so 

our charter contains ownership limits with respect to our common stock and other classes of capital stock 

our charter contains restrictions on the ownership and transfer of our common stock and preferred stock that are intended to assist us in preserving our qualification as a reit under our charter subject to certain exceptions no person or entity may own actually or constructively more than 98 by value or by number of shares whichever is more restrictive of the outstanding shares of our common stock or any class or series of our preferred stock 

additionally our charter has a 99 ownership limitation on the direct or indirect ownership of our voting shares which may include common stock or other classes of capital stock our board of directors in its sole discretion may exempt a proposed transferee from either ownership limit the ownership limits may delay defer or prevent a transaction or a change of control that might involve a premium price for our common stock or might otherwise be in the best interests of our stockholders 

general risk factors 



adverse changes in our credit ratings could impair our ability to obtain additional debt and equity financing on favorable terms if at all and negatively impact the market price of our securities including our common stock 

our credit ratings affect the amount and type of capital as well as the terms of any financing we may obtain the credit ratings of our senior unsecured debt are based on among other things our operating performance liquidity and leverage ratios overall financial position level of indebtedness and pending or future changes in the regulatory framework applicable to our operators and our industry if we are unable to maintain our current credit ratings we would likely incur higher borrowing costs which would make it more difficult or expensive to obtain additional financing or refinance existing obligations and commitments as a result of the potential impact of the covid19 pandemic in march 2020 moody’s changed its outlook on our longterm issuer and senior unsecured debt ratings from “stable” to “negative” such change in outlook may ultimately lead to a downgrade in our credit ratings which would trigger additional borrowing costs or other potentially negative consequences under our current credit facilities and debt instruments also if our credit ratings are downgraded or general market conditions were to ascribe higher risk to our ratings our industry or us our access to capital and the cost of any future debt financing will be further negatively impacted in addition the terms of future debt agreements could include more restrictive covenants or require incremental collateral which may further restrict our business operations or be unavailable due to our covenant restrictions then in effect there is no guarantee that debt or equity financings will be available in the future to fund future acquisitions or general operating expenses or that such financing will be available on terms consistent with our historical agreements or expectations 

we rely on information technology in our operations and any material failure inadequacy interruption or security failure of that technology could harm our business 

we rely on information technology networks and systems including the internet to process transmit and store electronic information and to manage or support a variety of business processes including financial transactions and records and to maintain personal identifying information and tenant and lease data we purchase some of our information technology from vendors on whom our systems depend we rely on commercially available systems software tools and monitoring to provide security for the processing transmission and storage of confidential tenant and customer data including individually identifiable information relating to financial accounts although we have taken steps to protect the security of our information systems and the data maintained in those systems it is possible that our safety and security measures will not prevent the systems’ improper functioning or damage or the improper access or disclosure of personally identifiable information such as in the event of cyberattacks the risk of security breaches has generally increased as the number intensity and sophistication of attacks and intrusions have increased and we have seen a significant increase in cyber phishing attacks since the onset of the covid19 pandemic the risk of security breaches has also increased with our increased dependence on the internet while our employees work remotely due to shelterinplace orders and our health and safety policies in addition the pace and unpredictability of cyber threats generally quickly renders longterm implementation plans designed to address cybersecurity risks obsolete furthermore because our operators also rely on the internet information technology networks systems and software we may be exposed to cyberattacks on our operators

covid19 update 



beginning in late 2019 a novel strain of coronavirus “covid19” began to spread throughout the world including the united states ultimately being declared a pandemic by the world health organization global health concerns and increased efforts to reduce the spread of the covid19 pandemic have prompted federal state and local governments to restrict normal daily activities and have resulted in travel bans quarantines school closings “shelterinplace” orders requiring individuals to remain in their homes other than to conduct essential services or activities as well as business limitations and shutdowns which resulted in closure of many businesses deemed to be nonessential although some of these restrictions have since been lifted or scaled back certain restrictions remain in place and any future surges of covid19 may lead to other restrictions being reimplemented in response to efforts to reduce the spread in addition our tenants operators and borrowers are facing significant cost increases as a result of increased health and safety measures including increased staffing demands for patient care and sanitation as well as increased usage and inventory of critical medical supplies and personal protective equipment these health and safety measures which may remain in place for a significant amount of time or be reimposed from time to time continue to place a substantial strain on the business operations of many of our tenants operators and borrowers 

senior housing 

within our shop and ccrc properties occupancy rates have declined since the onset of the pandemic a trend that may continue during the pandemic and for some period thereafter as a result of a reduction in or in some cases prohibitions on new tenant moveins due to stricter movein criteria lower inquiry volumes and reduced inperson tours as well as incidences of covid19 outbreaks at our facilities or the perception that outbreaks may occur outbreaks which directly affect our residents and the employees at our senior housing facilities have and could continue to materially and adversely disrupt operations as well as cause significant reputational harm to us our operators and our tenants as of february 8 2021 we had current confirmed resident covid19 cases at 85 of our 95 senior housing properties since the beginning of the pandemic our senior housing property operators are also experiencing significant cost increases as a result of higher staffing hours and compensation the implementation of increased health and safety measures and protocols and increased usage and inventory of critical medical supplies and personal protective equipment at our shop and ccrc facilities we bear these significant cost increases 

we andor our operators temporarily suspended redevelopment across our senior housing portfolio due to “shelterinplace” orders and local state and federal directives except for certain life safety and essential projects although some of these projects have been allowed to restart with infection control protocols in place future local state or federal orders could cause us to resuspend the work other projects remain suspended and we do not know when we will be able to restart construction in locations where construction continues construction workers are following applicable guidelines including appropriate social distancing limitations on large group gatherings in close proximity and increased sanitation efforts which has slowed the pace of construction these protective actions do not however eliminate the risk that outbreaks caused or spread by such activities may occur and impact our tenants operators and residents in addition our planned dispositions may not occur within the expected time or at all because of buyer terminations or withdrawals related to the pandemic capital constraints inability to tour properties or other factors relating to the pandemic 

the ultimate impact of the pandemic on senior housing generally and the public perception of senior housing as a desirable residential setting depend on a number of factors that are unknown at this time including but not limited to i the course and severity of the pandemic ii responses of public and private health authorities and iii the timing distribution and health effects of vaccines and other treatments 

medical office portfolio 

within our medical office portfolio many physician practices and affiliated hospitals initially delayed or discontinued nonessential surgeries and procedures due to “shelterinplace” orders and other health and safety measures which negatively impacted their cash flows during part of 2020 these restrictions have now been lifted in the majority of our markets and operations are at or near prepandemic levels however we expect that planned moveouts will be delayed during the covid19 pandemic which is expected to slightly increase shortterm retention in this portfolio 

we implemented a deferred rent program during the second and third quarters of 2020 that was limited to certain nonhealth system and nonhospital tenants in good standing which reduced our cash collections during those months although we required that the deferred rent be repaid ratably by the end of 2020 under this program we agreed to defer approximately 6 million of rent through december 31 2020 substantially all of which had been collected as of december 31 2020 we may also implement a deferred rent program for future periods 

life science portfolio 

within our life science portfolio we have numerous tenants that are working tirelessly to address critical research and testing needs in the fight against covid19 we are focused on providing our tenants with the necessary space to complete their critical work and are in continuous contact with our tenants regarding how we can help them meet their needs through december 31 2020 we had provided approximately 1 million of rent deferrals to our life science tenants all of which was required to be repaid by the end of 2020 as of december 31 2020 all of the deferred rent had been collected 

however within our life science portfolio we may experience a decline in leasing activity at certain points during the covid19 pandemic as a result of governmental restrictions on business activities in the greater san francisco and boston areas we temporarily suspended development redevelopment and tenant improvement projects at many of our life science properties resulting in delayed deliveries and project completions though we have been able to continue or restart these projects we remain subject to future governmental restrictions that may again suspend these projects even when these projects continue we have been experiencing losses in efficiency as a result of the implementation of health and safety protocols related to social distancing and proper hygiene and sanitization 

liquidity 

we believe that we are well positioned to manage the shortterm and longterm impacts of the covid19 pandemic and the measures to slow its spread while working closely with our tenants operators and borrowers as they navigate the pandemic we had approximately 251 billion of liquidity available including 226 billion borrowing capacity under our bank line of credit facility and 259 million of cash and cash equivalents as of february 8 2021 while a future downgrade in our credit ratings would adversely impact our cost of borrowing we believe we continue to have access to the unsecured debt markets we could also seek to enter into one or more secured debt financings issue additional securities including under our 2020 atm program as defined below or dispose of certain additional assets to fund future operating costs capital expenditures or acquisitions although no assurances can be made in this regard 

future rent collections 

the impact of covid19 on the ability of our tenants to pay rent in the future is currently unknown we have and will continue to monitor the credit quality of each of our tenants and writeoff straightline rent and accounts receivable as necessary in the event we conclude that substantially all of a tenant’s straightline rent or accounts receivable is not probable of collection in the future such amounts will be written off which could have a material impact on our future results of operations 

employee update 

we have taken and will continue to take proactive measures to provide for the wellbeing of our workforce we have maximized our systems infrastructure as well as virtual and remote working technologies for our employees including our executive team to ensure productivity and connectivity internally as well as with key thirdparty relationships 

the extent of the impact of the covid19 pandemic on our business and financial results will depend on future developments including the duration severity and spread of covid19 health and safety actions taken to contain its spread any new surges of covid19 the severity of outbreak of new strains of covid19 the timing and distribution of vaccines and other treatments and how quickly and to what extent normal economic and operating conditions can resume within the markets in which we operate each of which are highly uncertain at this time and outside of our control

results of operations 

we evaluate our business and allocate resources among our reportable business segments i life science ii medical office and iii ccrc under the life science and medical office segments we invest through the acquisition and development of life science facilities mobs and hospitals which generally require a greater level of property management our ccrcs are operated through ridea structures we have other nonreportable segments that are comprised primarily of interests in an unconsolidated senior housing joint venture and debt investments we evaluate performance based upon property adjusted net operating income “adjusted noi” or “cash noi” in each segment the accounting policies of the segments are the same as those described in the summary of significant accounting policies see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements 

in conjunction with classifying our senior housing triplenet and shop portfolios as discontinued operations as of december 31 2020 the results of operations related to those portfolios are no longer presented in reportable business segments accordingly results of operations of those portfolios are not included in the reportable business segment analysis below refer to note 5 to the consolidated financial statements for further information regarding discontinued operations 

nongaap financial measures 

net operating income 

noi and adjusted noi are nonus generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” supplemental financial measures used to evaluate the operating performance of real estate noi is defined as real estate revenues inclusive of rental and related revenues resident fees and services income from direct financing leases and government grant income and exclusive of interest income less property level operating expenses which exclude transition costs noi excludes all other financial statement amounts included in net income loss as presented in note 16 to the consolidated financial statements adjusted noi is calculated as noi after eliminating the effects of straightline rents dfl noncash interest amortization of market lease intangibles termination fees actuarial reserves for insurance claims that have been incurred but not reported and the impact of deferred community fee income and expense noi and adjusted noi include our share of income loss generated by unconsolidated joint ventures and exclude noncontrolling interests’ share of income loss generated by consolidated joint ventures adjusted noi is oftentimes referred to as “cash noi” management believes noi and adjusted noi are important supplemental measures because they provide relevant and useful information by reflecting only income and operating expense items that are incurred at the property level and present them on an unlevered basis we use noi and adjusted noi to make decisions about resource allocations to assess and compare property level performance and to evaluate our samestore “ss” performance as described below we believe that net income loss is the most directly comparable gaap measure to noi and adjusted noi noi and adjusted noi should not be viewed as alternative measures of operating performance to net income loss as defined by gaap since they do not reflect various excluded items further our definitions of noi and adjusted noi may not be comparable to the definitions used by other reits or real estate companies as they may use different methodologies for calculating noi and adjusted noi for a reconciliation of noi and adjusted noi to net income loss by segment refer to note 16 to the consolidated financial statements 

operating expenses generally relate to leased medical office and life science properties as well as shop and ccrc facilities we generally recover all or a portion of our leased medical office and life science property expenses through tenant recoveries we present expenses as operating or general and administrative based on the underlying nature of the expense 

samestore 

samestore noi and adjusted cash noi information allows us to evaluate the performance of our property portfolio under a consistent population by eliminating changes in the composition of our consolidated portfolio of properties samestore adjusted noi excludes amortization of deferred revenue from tenantfunded improvements and certain nonproperty specific operating expenses that are allocated to each operating segment on a consolidated basis 

properties are included in samestore once they are stabilized for the full period in both comparison periods newly acquired operating assets are generally considered stabilized at the earlier of leaseup typically when the tenants controls the physical use of at least 80 of the space or 12 months from the acquisition date newly completed developments and redevelopments are considered stabilized at the earlier of leaseup or 24 months from the date the property is placed in service properties that experience a change in reporting structure such as a conversion from a triplenet lease to a ridea reporting structure are considered stabilized after 12 months in operations under a consistent reporting structure a property is removed from samestore when it is classified as held for sale sold placed into redevelopment experiences a casualty event that significantly impacts operations a change in reporting structure or operator transition has been agreed to or a significant tenant relocates from a samestore property to a non samestore property and that change results in a corresponding increase in revenue we do not report samestore metrics for our other nonreportable segments 

for a reconciliation of samestore to total portfolio adjusted noi and other relevant disclosures by segment refer to our segment analysis below 

funds from operations ffo 

ffo encompasses nareit ffo and ffo as adjusted each of which is described in detail below we believe ffo applicable to common shares diluted ffo applicable to common shares and diluted ffo per common share are important supplemental nongaap measures of operating performance for a reit because the historical cost accounting convention used for real estate assets utilizes straightline depreciation except on land such accounting presentation implies that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time since real estate values instead have historically risen and fallen with market conditions presentations of operating results for a reit that use historical cost accounting for depreciation could be less informative the term ffo was designed by the reit industry to address this issue 

nareit ffo  ffo as defined by the national association of real estate investment trusts “nareit” is net income loss applicable to common shares computed in accordance with gaap excluding gains or losses from sales of depreciable property including any current and deferred taxes directly associated with sales of depreciable property impairments of or related to depreciable real estate plus real estate and other real estaterelated depreciation and amortization and adjustments to compute our share of nareit ffo and ffo as adjusted see below from joint ventures adjustments for joint ventures are calculated to reflect our prorata share of both our consolidated and unconsolidated joint ventures we reflect our share of nareit ffo for unconsolidated joint ventures by applying our actual ownership percentage for the period to the applicable reconciling items on an entity by entity basis for consolidated joint ventures in which we do not own 100 we reflect our share of the equity by adjusting our nareit ffo to remove the third party ownership share of the applicable reconciling items based on actual ownership percentage for the applicable periods our prorata share information is prepared on a basis consistent with the comparable consolidated amounts is intended to reflect our proportionate economic interest in the operating results of properties in our portfolio and is calculated by applying our actual ownership percentage for the period we do not control the unconsolidated joint ventures and the prorata presentations of reconciling items included in nareit ffo do not represent our legal claim to such items the joint venture members or partners are entitled to profit or loss allocations and distributions of cash flows according to the joint venture agreements which provide for such allocations generally according to their invested capital

liquidity and capital resources 

we anticipate that our cash flow from operations available cash balances and cash from our various financing activities will be adequate for at least the next 12 months for purposes of i funding recurring operating expenses ii meeting debt service requirements and iii satisfying our distributions to our stockholders and noncontrolling interest members during the year ended december 31 2020 distributions to common shareholders and noncontrolling interest holders exceeded cash flows from operations by approximately 66 million distributions were made using a combination of cash flows from operations funds available under our bank line of credit and commercial paper program proceeds from the sale of properties and other sources of cash available to us 

our principal investing liquidity needs for the next 12 months are to 

• fund capital expenditures including tenant improvements and leasing costs and 

• fund future acquisition transactional and development activities 

we anticipate satisfying these future investing needs using one or more of the following 

• cash flow from operations 

• sale of or exchange of ownership interests in properties or other investments 

• borrowings under our bank line of credit and commercial paper program 

• issuance of additional debt including unsecured notes term loans and mortgage debt andor 

• issuance of common or preferred stock or its equivalent 

our ability to access the capital markets impacts our cost of capital and ability to refinance maturing indebtedness as well as our ability to fund future acquisitions and development through the issuance of additional securities or secured debt credit ratings impact our ability to access capital and directly impact our cost of capital as well for example our bank line of credit and term loan accrue interest at a rate per annum equal to libor plus a margin that depends upon the credit ratings of our senior unsecured long term debt we also pay a facility fee on the entire revolving commitment that depends upon our credit ratings as of february 8 2021 we had longterm credit ratings of baa1 from moody’s and bbb from sp global and fitch and shortterm credit ratings of p2 a2 and f2 from moodys sp global and fitch respectively 

a downgrade in credit ratings by moody’s sp global and fitch may have a negative impact on the interest rates and facility fees for our bank line of credit and term loan while a downgrade in our credit ratings would adversely impact our cost of borrowing we believe we continue to have access to the unsecured debt markets and we could also seek to enter into one or more secured debt financings issue additional securities including under our 2020 atm program as defined below or dispose of certain assets to fund future operating costs capital expenditures or acquisitions although no assurances can be made in this regard refer to “covid19 update” above for a more comprehensive discussion of the potential impact of covid19 on our business

operating cash flows 

operating cash flow decreased 88 million between the years ended december 31 2020 and 2019 primarily as the result of i the termination fee paid to brookdale in connection with the ccrc acquisition ii assets sold during 2019 and 2020 and iii additional expenses and decreased occupancy in our shop and ccrc assets related to covid19 the decrease in operating cash flow is partially offset by i 2019 and 2020 acquisitions ii annual rent increases iii new leasing activity iv developments and redevelopments placed in service during 2019 and 2020 and v increased interest received from new loan investments 

operating cash flow decreased 3 million between the years ended december 31 2019 and 2018 primarily as the result of i dispositions during 2018 and 2019 and ii occupancy declines and higher labor costs within our shop assets the decrease in operating cash flow is partially offset by i 2018 and 2019 acquisitions ii annual rent increases iii developments and redevelopments placed in service during 2018 and 2019 and iv decreased interest paid as a result of debt repayments during 2018 and 2019

equity 



at december 31 2020 we had 538 million shares of common stock outstanding equity totaled 73 billion and our equity securities had a market value of 165 billion 

at december 31 2020 nonmanaging members held an aggregate of five million units in seven limited liability companies “downreits” for which we are the managing member the downreit units are exchangeable for an amount of cash approximating the thencurrent market value of shares of our common stock or at our option shares of our common stock subject to certain adjustments such as stock splits and reclassifications at december 31 2020 the outstanding downreit units were convertible into approximately seven million shares of our common stock 

atthemarket program 

in february 2020 we terminated our previous atthemarket equity offering program and concurrently established a new atthemarket equity offering program the “2020 atm program” in addition to the issuance and sale of shares of our common stock we may also enter into one or more forward sales agreements with sales agents for the sale of our shares of common stock under our 2020 atm program

at december 31 2020 approximately 125 billion of our common stock remained available for sale under the 2020 atm program actual future sales of our common stock will depend upon a variety of factors including but not limited to market conditions the trading price of our common stock and our capital needs we have no obligation to sell any of the remaining shares under our 2020 atm program 

other than in connection with settlement of atm forward contracts described above during the year ended december 31 2020 we did not issue any shares of our common stock under our 2020 atm program 

see note 13 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information about our 2020 atm program and our previous atthemarket equity offering program 

shelf registration 



in may 2018 we filed a prospectus with the sec as part of a registration statement on form s3 using an automatic shelf registration process this shelf registration statement expires in may 2021 and at or prior to such time we expect to file a new shelf registration statement under the “shelf” process we may sell any combination of the securities described in the prospectus through one or more offerings the securities described in the prospectus include common stock preferred stock depositary shares debt securities and warrants 

contractual obligations 

the following table summarizes our material contractual payment obligations and commitments excluding obligations and commitments related to assets classified as discontinued operations at december 31 2020 in thousands

5 represents construction and other commitments for developments in progress and includes allowances for tenant improvements of 28 million that we have provided as a lessor 

6 interest on variablerate debt is calculated using rates in effect at december 31 2020 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

we own interests in certain unconsolidated joint ventures as described in note 9 to the consolidated financial statements except in limited circumstances our risk of loss is limited to our investment in the joint venture and any outstanding loans receivable we have no other material offbalance sheet arrangements that we expect would materially affect our liquidity and capital resources except those described above under “contractual obligations” 

inflation 

our leases often provide for either fixed increases in base rents or indexed escalators based on the consumer price index or other measures andor additional rent based on increases in the tenants’ operating revenues most of our mob leases require the tenant to pay a share of property operating costs such as real estate taxes insurance and utilities substantially all of our senior housing triplenet life science and remaining other leases require the tenant or operator to pay all of the property operating costs or reimburse us for all such costs we believe that inflationary increases in expenses will be offset in part by the tenant or operator expense reimbursements and contractual rent increases described above

critical accounting policies 

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us gaap requires our management to use judgment in the application of accounting policies including making estimates and assumptions we base estimates on the best information available to us at the time our experience and on various other assumptions believed to be reasonable under the circumstances these estimates affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods if our judgment or interpretation of the facts and circumstances relating to various transactions or other matters had been different it is possible that different accounting would have been applied resulting in a different presentation of our consolidated financial statements from time to time we reevaluate our estimates and assumptions in the event estimates or assumptions prove to be different from actual results adjustments are made in subsequent periods to reflect more current estimates and assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain for a more detailed discussion of our significant accounting policies see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements below is a discussion of accounting policies that we consider critical in that they may require complex judgment in their application or require estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain 

principles of consolidation 



the consolidated financial statements include the accounts of healthpeak properties inc our whollyowned subsidiaries and joint ventures and variable interest entities “vies” that we control through voting rights or other means we consolidate investments in vies when we are the primary beneficiary of the vie a variable interest holder is considered to be the primary beneficiary of a vie if it has the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the entity’s economic performance and has the obligation to absorb losses of or the right to receive benefits from the entity that could potentially be significant to the vie 

we make judgments about which entities are vies based on an assessment of whether i the equity investment at risk is insufficient to finance that entity’s activities without additional subordinated financial support ii substantially all of an entity’s activities either involve or are conducted on behalf of an investor that has disproportionately few voting rights or iii the equity investors as a group lack any of the following a the power through voting or similar rights to direct the activities of an entity that most significantly impact the entity’s economic performance b the obligation to absorb the expected losses of an entity or c the right to receive the expected residual returns of an entity criterion iii above is generally applied to limited partnerships and similarly structured entities by assessing whether a simple majority of the limited partners hold substantive rights to participate in the significant decisions of the entity or have the ability to remove the decision maker or liquidate the entity without cause if neither of those criteria are met the entity is a vie 

we continually assess whether events have occurred that require us to reconsider the initial determination of whether an entity is a vie such events include but are not limited to i a change to the contractual arrangements of the entity or in the ability of a party to exercise its participation or kickout rights ii a change to the capitalization structure of the entity or iii acquisitions or sales of interests that constitute a change in control when a reconsideration event occurs we reassess whether the entity is a vie 

we also make judgments with respect to our level of influence or control over an entity and whether we are or are not the primary beneficiary of a vie consideration of various factors includes but is not limited to 

• which activities most significantly impact the entity’s economic performance and our ability to direct those activities 

• our form of ownership interest 

• our representation on the entity’s governing body 

• the size and seniority of our investment 

• our ability to manage our ownership interest relative to other interest holders and 

• our ability and the rights of other investors to participate in policy making decisions replace the manager andor liquidate the entity if applicable 

our ability to correctly assess our influence or control over an entity when determining the primary beneficiary of a vie affects the presentation of these entities in our consolidated financial statements when we perform a reassessment of the primary beneficiary at a date other than at inception of the vie our assumptions may be different and may result in the identification of a different primary beneficiary 

if we determine that we are the primary beneficiary of a vie our consolidated financial statements include the operating results of the vie rather than the results of our variable interest in the vie we require vies to provide us timely financial information and review the internal controls of vies to determine if we can rely on the financial information it provides if a vie has deficiencies in its internal controls over financial reporting or does not provide us with timely financial information it may adversely impact the quality andor timing of our financial reporting and our internal controls over financial reporting 

revenue recognition 



lease classification 

at the inception of a new lease arrangement including new leases that arise from amendments we assess the terms and conditions to determine the proper lease classification for leases entered into prior to january 1 2019 the lease arrangement was classified as an operating lease if none of the following criteria were met i transfer of ownership to the lessee prior to or shortly after the end of the lease term ii the lessee had a bargain purchase option during or at the end of the lease term iii the lease term was equal to 75 or more of the underlying property’s economic life or iv the present value of future minimum lease payments excluding executory costs was equal to 90 or more of the estimated fair value of the leased asset if one of the four criteria was met and the minimum lease payments were determined to be reasonably predictable and collectible the lease arrangement was generally accounted for as a dfl 

concurrent with our adoption of accounting standards update asu no 201602 leases “asu 201602” on january 1 2019 we began classifying a lease entered into subsequent to adoption as an operating lease if none of the following criteria are met i transfer of ownership to the lessee by the end of the lease term ii lessee has a purchase option during or at the end of the lease term that it is reasonably certain to exercise iii the lease term is for the major part of the remaining economic life of the underlying asset iv the present value of future minimum lease payments is equal to substantially all of the fair value of the underlying asset or v the underlying asset is of such a specialized nature that it is expected to have no alternative use to us at the end of the lease term 

if the assumptions utilized in the above classification assessments were different our lease classification for accounting purposes may have been different thus the timing and amount of our revenue recognized would have been impacted which may be material to our consolidated financial statements 

rental and related revenues 

we recognize rental revenue for operating leases on a straightline basis over the lease term when collectibility of all minimum lease payments is probable and the tenant has taken possession or controls the physical use of a leased asset if the lease provides for tenant improvements we determine whether the tenant improvements are owned by the tenant or us when we are the owner of the tenant improvements the tenant is not considered to have taken physical possession or have control of the leased asset until the tenant improvements are substantially complete when the tenant is the owner of the tenant improvements any tenant improvement allowance funded is treated as a lease incentive and amortized as a reduction of revenue over the lease term the determination of ownership of a tenant improvement is subject to significant judgment if our assessment of the owner of the tenant improvements was different the timing and amount of our revenue recognized would be impacted 

certain leases provide for additional rents that are contingent upon a percentage of the facility’s revenue in excess of specified base amounts or other thresholds such revenue is recognized when actual results reported by the tenant or estimates of tenant results exceed the base amount or other thresholds the recognition of additional rents requires us to make estimates of amounts owed and to a certain extent is dependent on the accuracy of the facility results reported to us our estimates may differ from actual results which could be material to our consolidated financial statements 

resident fees and services 

resident fee revenue is recorded when services are rendered and includes resident room and care charges community fees and other resident charges residency agreements are generally for a term of 30 days to one year with resident fees billed monthly in advance revenue for certain care related services is recognized as services are provided and is billed monthly in arrears 

certain of our ccrcs are operated as entrance fee communities which typically require a resident to pay an upfront entrance fee that includes both a refundable portion and nonrefundable portion when we receive a nonrefundable entrance fee it is recognized as deferred revenue and amortized into revenue over the estimated stay of the resident 

credit losses 



we continuously assess the collectibility of operating lease straightline rent receivables if it is no longer probable that substantially all future minimum lease payments will be received the straightline rent receivable balance is written off and recognized as a decrease in revenue in that period we monitor the liquidity and creditworthiness of our tenants and operators on a continuous basis this evaluation considers industry and economic conditions property performance credit enhancements and other factors we exercise judgment in this assessment and consider payment history and current credit status in developing these estimates these estimates may differ from actual results which could be material to our consolidated financial statements 

loans receivable and dfls collectively “finance receivables” are reviewed and assigned an internal rating of performing watch list or workout finance receivables that are deemed performing meet all present contractual obligations and collection and timing of all amounts owed is reasonably assured watch list finance receivables are defined as finance receivables that do not meet the definition of performing or workout workout finance receivables are defined as finance receivables in which we have determined based on current information and events that i it is probable we will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the agreement ii the tenant operator or borrower is delinquent on making payments under the contractual terms of the agreement and iii we have commenced action or anticipate pursuing action in the near term to seek recovery of our investment 

finance receivables are placed on nonaccrual status when management determines that the collectibility of contractual amounts is not reasonably assured the asset will have an internal rating of either watch list or workout further we perform a credit analysis to support the tenant’s operator’s borrower’s andor guarantor’s repayment capacity and the underlying collateral values we use the cash basis method of accounting for finance receivables placed on nonaccrual status unless one of the following conditions exist whereby we utilize the cost recovery method of accounting i if we determine that it is probable that we will only recover the recorded investment in the finance receivable net of associated allowances or chargeoffs if any or ii we cannot reasonably estimate the amount of an impaired finance receivable for cash basis method of accounting we apply payments received excluding principal paydowns to interest income so long as that amount does not exceed the amount that would have been earned under the original contractual terms for cost recovery method of accounting any payment received is applied to reduce the recorded investment generally we return a finance receivable to accrual status when all delinquent payments become current under the terms of the loan or lease agreements and collectibility of the remaining contractual loan or lease payments is reasonably assured 

prior to the adoption of asu no 201613 measurement of credit losses on financial instruments “asu 201613” on january 1 2020 allowances were established for finance receivables on an individual basis utilizing an estimate of probable losses if they were determined to be impaired finance receivables were impaired when it was deemed probable that we would be unable to collect all amounts due in accordance with the contractual terms of the loan or lease an allowance was based upon our assessment of the lessee’s or borrower’s overall financial condition economic resources payment record the prospects for support from any financially responsible guarantors and if appropriate the net realizable value of any collateral these estimates considered all available evidence including the expected future cash flows discounted at the finance receivable’s effective interest rate fair value of collateral general economic conditions and trends historical and industry loss experience and other relevant factors as appropriate if a finance receivable was deemed partially or wholly uncollectible the uncollectible balance was charged off against the allowance in the period in which the uncollectible determination has been made 

subsequent to adopting asu 201613 on january 1 2020 we began using a loss model that relies on future expected credit losses rather than incurred losses as was required under historical us gaap under the new model we are required to recognize future credit losses expected to be incurred over the life of a finance receivable at inception of that instrument the model emphasizes historical experience and future market expectations to determine a loss to be recognized at inception however the model continues to be applied on an individual basis and rely on counterparty specific information to ensure the most accurate estimate is recognized 

real estate 



we make estimates as part of our process for allocating a purchase price to the various identifiable assets and liabilities of an acquisition based upon the relative fair value of each asset or liability the most significant components of our allocations are typically buildings asifvacant land and inplace leases in the case of allocating fair value to buildings and intangibles our fair value estimates will affect the amount of depreciation and amortization we record over the estimated useful life of each asset acquired in the case of allocating fair value to inplace leases we make our best estimates based on our evaluation of the specific characteristics of each tenant’s lease factors considered include estimates of carrying costs during hypothetical expected leaseup periods market conditions and costs to execute similar leases our assumptions affect the amount of future revenue andor depreciation and amortization expense that we will recognize over the remaining useful life for the acquired inplace leases 

certain of our acquisitions involve the assumption of contract liabilities we typically estimate the fair value of contract liabilities by applying a reasonable profit margin to the total discounted estimated future costs associated with servicing the contract we consider a variety of market and contractspecific conditions when making assumptions that impact the estimated fair value of the contract liability 

a variety of costs are incurred in the development and leasing of properties after determination is made to capitalize a cost it is allocated to the specific component of a project that is benefited determination of when a development project is substantially complete and capitalization must cease involves a degree of judgment the costs of land and buildings under development include specifically identifiable costs the capitalized costs include preconstruction costs essential to the development of the property development costs construction costs interest costs real estate taxes and other costs incurred during the period of development we consider a construction project to be considered substantially complete and available for occupancy and cease capitalization of costs upon the completion of the related tenant improvements 

assets held for sale and discontinued operations 



we classify a real estate property as held for sale when i management has approved the disposal ii the property is available for sale in its present condition iii an active program to locate a buyer has been initiated iv it is probable that the property will be disposed of within one year v the property is being marketed at a reasonable price relative to its fair value and vi it is unlikely that the disposal plan will significantly change or be withdrawn if an asset is classified as held for sale it is reported at the lower of its carrying value or fair value less costs to sell and no longer depreciated 

we classify a loan receivable as held for sale when we no longer have the intent and ability to hold the loan receivable for the foreseeable future or until maturity if a loan receivable is classified as held for sale it is reported at the lower of amortized cost or fair value 

a discontinued operation represents i a component of an entity or group of components that has been disposed of or is classified as held for sale in a single transaction and represents a strategic shift that has or will have a major effect on our operations and financial results or ii an acquired business that is classified as held for sale on the date of acquisition examples of a strategic shift may include disposing of i a separate major line of business ii a separate major geographic area of operations or iii other major parts of the company 

impairment of longlived assets 



we assess the carrying value of our real estate assets and related intangibles “real estate assets” when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable recoverability of real estate assets is measured by comparing the carrying amount of the real estate assets to the respective estimated future undiscounted cash flows the expected future undiscounted cash flows reflect external market factors and are probabilityweighted to reflect multiple possible cashflow scenarios including selling the assets at various points in the future additionally the estimated future undiscounted cash flows are calculated utilizing the lowest level of identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities in order to review our real estate assets for recoverability we make assumptions regarding external market conditions including capitalization rates and growth rates forecasted cash flows and sales prices and our intent with respect to holding or disposing of the asset if our analysis indicates that the carrying value of the real estate assets is not recoverable on an undiscounted cash flow basis we recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the real estate asset 

determining the fair value of real estate assets including assets classified as heldforsale involves significant judgment and generally utilizes market capitalization rates comparable market transactions estimated perunit or per square foot prices negotiations with prospective buyers and forecasted cash flows lease revenue rates expense rates growth rates etc our ability to accurately predict future operating results and resulting cash flows and estimate fair values impacts the timing and recognition of impairments while we believe our assumptions are reasonable changes in these assumptions may have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 

investments in unconsolidated joint ventures 



the initial carrying value of investments in unconsolidated joint ventures is based on the amount paid to purchase the joint venture interest the fair value of assets contributed to the joint venture or the fair value of the assets prior to the sale of interests in the joint venture we evaluate our equity method investments for impairment by first reviewing for indicators of impairment based on the performance of the underlying real estate assets held by the joint venture if an equitymethod investment shows indicators of impairment we compare the fair value of the investment to the carrying value if we determine there is a decline in the fair value of our investment in an unconsolidated joint venture below its carrying value and it is otherthantemporary an impairment charge is recorded the determination of the fair value of investments in unconsolidated joint ventures and as to whether a deficiency in fair value is otherthantemporary involves significant judgment our estimates consider all available evidence including as appropriate the present value of the expected future cash flows discounted at market rates general economic conditions and trends severity and duration of a fair value deficiency and other relevant factors capitalization rates discount rates and credit spreads utilized in our valuation models are based on rates we believe to be within a reasonable range of current market rates for the respective investments while we believe our assumptions are reasonable changes in these assumptions may have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 

income taxes 



as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements significant management judgment is required to evaluate our compliance with reit requirements our determinations are based on interpretation of tax laws and our conclusions may have an impact on the income tax expense recognized adjustments to income tax expense may be required as a result of i audits conducted by federal state and local tax authorities ii our ability to qualify as a reit iii the potential for builtin gain recognition and iv changes in tax laws adjustments required in any given period are included within the income tax provision 

we are required to evaluate our deferred tax assets for realizability and recognize a valuation allowance which is recorded against its deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will not be realized we consider all available evidence in its determination of whether a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets is required 

recent accounting pronouncements 

see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for the impact of new accounting standards 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we are exposed to various market risks including the potential loss arising from adverse changes in interest rates we use derivative and other financial instruments in the normal course of business to mitigate interest rate risk we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes derivatives are recorded on the consolidated balance sheets at fair value see note 22 to the consolidated financial statements 

to illustrate the effect of movements in the interest rate markets we performed a market sensitivity analysis on our hedging instruments we applied various basis point spreads to the underlying interest rate curves of the derivative portfolio in order to determine the change in fair value assuming a one percentage point change in the underlying interest rate curve the estimated change in fair value of each of the underlying derivative instruments would not be material 

interest rate risk 



at december 31 2020 our exposure to interest rate risk is primarily on our variable rate debt at december 31 2020 36 million of our variablerate debt was hedged by interest rate swap transactions the interest rate swaps are designated as cash flow hedges with the objective of managing the exposure to interest rate risk by converting the interest rates on our variablerate debt to fixed interest rates 

interest rate fluctuations will generally not affect our future earnings or cash flows on our fixed rate debt and assets until their maturity or earlier prepayment and refinancing if interest rates have risen at the time we seek to refinance our fixed rate debt whether at maturity or otherwise our future earnings and cash flows could be adversely affected by additional borrowing costs conversely lower interest rates at the time of refinancing may reduce our overall borrowing costs however interest rate changes will affect the fair value of our fixed rate instruments at december 31 2020 a one percentage point increase or decrease in interest rates would change the fair value of our fixed rate debt by approximately 369 million and 401 million respectively and would not materially impact earnings or cash flows additionally a one percentage point increase or decrease in interest rates would change the fair value of our fixed rate debt investments by approximately 2 million and would not materially impact earnings or cash flows conversely changes in interest rates on variable rate debt and investments would change our future earnings and cash flows but not materially impact the fair value of those instruments assuming a one percentage point change in the interest rate related to our variablerate debt and variablerate investments and assuming no other changes in the outstanding balance at december 31 2020 our annual interest expense and interest income would increase by approximately 3 million and 1 million respectively 

market risk 



we have investments in marketable debt securities classified as heldtomaturity because we have the positive intent and ability to hold the securities to maturity heldtomaturity securities are recorded at amortized cost and adjusted for the amortization of premiums and discounts through maturity we consider a variety of factors in evaluating an otherthantemporary decline in value such as the length of time and the extent to which the market value has been less than our current adjusted carrying value the issuer’s financial condition capital strength and nearterm prospects any recent events specific to that issuer and economic conditions of its industry and our investment horizon in relationship to an anticipated nearterm recovery in the market value if any at december 31 2020 both the fair value and carrying value of marketable debt securities was 20 million

business 

tableend general overview 

healthpeak properties inc is a standard  poors sp 500 company that acquires develops owns leases and manages healthcare real estate across the united states us we are a maryland corporation and qualify as a selfadministered reit we are headquartered in irvine california with additional offices in nashville and san francisco at december 31 2019  we had 204 fulltime employees 

on october 30 2019 we changed our name from hcp inc to healthpeak properties inc our common shares began trading on the new york stock exchange under the new name and ticker symbol peak on november 5 2019 

we invest in a diversified portfolio of highquality healthcare properties across our three core asset classes of senior housing life science and medical office real estate our senior housing properties are either operated under triplenet leases in our senior housing triplenet segment or through ridea structures in our senior housing operating portfolio “shop” segment under the life science and medical office segments we invest through the acquisition development and management of life science buildings and medical office buildings we have other nonreportable segments that are comprised primarily of our unconsolidated joint ventures hospital properties and debt investments 

at december 31 2019  our consolidated portfolio of investments consisted of interests in 617 properties we also owned interests in 48 properties owned by our unconsolidated joint ventures at december 31 2019  the following table summarizes information for our reportable segments for the year ended december 31 2019 dollars in thousands

for a description of our significant activities during 2019  see “item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations— 2019 transaction overview” in this report 

business strategy 

we invest in and manage our real estate portfolio for the longterm to maximize benefit to our stockholders and support the growth of our dividends our strategy consists of four core elements 



 internal growth strategies 

we believe our real estate portfolio holds the potential for increased future cash flows as it is wellmaintained and in desirable locations our strategy for maximizing the benefits from these opportunities is to i work with new or existing tenants and operators to address their space and capital needs and ii provide highquality property management services in order to motivate tenants to renew expand or relocate into our properties 

we expect to continue our internal growth as a result of our ability to 

 investment strategies 

the delivery of healthcare services requires real estate and as a result tenants and operators depend on real estate in part to maintain and grow their businesses we believe the healthcare real estate market provides investment opportunities due to the i compelling longterm demographics driving the demand for healthcare services ii specialized nature of healthcare real estate investing and iii ongoing consolidation of the fragmented healthcare real estate sector 

while we emphasize healthcare real estate ownership we may also provide real estate secured financing to or invest in equity or debt securities of healthcare operators or other entities engaged in healthcare real estate ownership we may also acquire all or substantially all of the securities or assets of other reits operating companies or similar entities where such investments would be consistent with our investment strategies we may coinvest alongside institutional or development investors through partnerships or limited liability companies 

we monitor but do not limit our investments based on the percentage of our total assets that may be invested in any one property type investment vehicle or geographic location the number of properties that may be leased to a single tenant or operator or loans that may be made to a single borrower in allocating capital we target opportunities with the most attractive riskreward profile for our portfolio as a whole we may take additional measures to mitigate risk including diversifying our investments by sector geography tenant or operator structuring transactions as master leases requiring tenant or operator insurance and indemnifications andor obtaining credit enhancements in the form of guarantees letters of credit or security deposits 

we believe we are wellpositioned to achieve external growth through acquisitions financing and development other factors that contribute to our competitive position include 



 financing strategies 

our reit qualification requires us to distribute at least 90 of our reit taxable income excluding net capital gains therefore we do not retain a significant amount of capital as a result we regularly access the public equity and debt markets to raise the funds necessary to finance acquisitions and debt investments develop and redevelop properties and refinance maturing debt 

we may finance acquisitions and other investments through the following vehicles 

 we maintain a disciplined balance sheet by actively managing our debt to equity levels and maintaining multiple sources of liquidity our debt obligations are primarily longterm fixed rate with staggered maturities 

we finance our investments based on our evaluation of available sources of funding for shortterm purposes we may utilize our revolving line of credit facility or commercial paper program arrange for other shortterm borrowings from banks or other sources or issue equity securities pursuant to our atthemarket equity offering program we arrange for longerterm financing by offering debt and equity securities placing mortgage debt and obtaining capital from institutional lenders and joint venture partners 

segments 

senior housing triplenet and senior housing operating portfolio or shop 

our senior housing properties are owned either through triplenet leases with third party tenantoperators or through socalled ridea structures which is permitted by the housing and economic recovery act of 2008 and includes most of the provisions previously proposed in the reit investment diversification and empowerment act of 2007 commonly referred to as “ridea” our senior housing properties include independent living facilities “ilfs” assisted living facilities “alfs” memory care facilities “mcfs” and continuing care retirement communities “ccrcs” which cater to different segments of the elderly population based upon their personal needs the services provided by our third party tenantoperators under triplenet leases or by our thirdparty manageroperators under a ridea structure at our properties are primarily paid for by the residents directly or through private insurance and are less reliant on government reimbursement programs such as medicare and medicaid 

our triplenet leases are typically longterm agreements with third party tenantoperators under triplenet leases our tenantoperators are typically responsible for the ongoing expenses of the property including real estate taxes insurance and maintenance in addition to paying rent and utilities additionally operational risks and liabilities are the responsibility of our tenantoperator including with respect to any employment matters compliance with healthcare and other laws and liabilities relating to personal injurytort matters residentpatient quality of care claims and governmental reimbursement matters 

a ridea structure allows us through a taxable reit subsidiary “trs” to receive cash flow from the operations of a healthcare facility as compared to only receiving contractual rent from a thirdparty tenantoperator under a triplenet lease structure in compliance with reit tax requirements the criteria for operating a healthcare facility through a ridea structure require us to lease the facility to an affiliate trs under a triplenet lease and for such affiliate trs to engage an independent qualifying management company also known as an eligible independent contractor or thirdparty operator to manage and operate the daytoday business of the facility in exchange for a management fee as a result under a ridea structure we are required to rely on a thirdparty operator to hire and train all facility employees enter into many thirdparty contracts for the benefit of the facility including residentpatient agreements comply with laws including but not limited to healthcare laws and provide resident care we are substantially limited in our ability to control or influence daytoday operations under a ridea structure and thus rely on the thirdparty tenantoperator to manage and operate the business 

unlike our triplenet leased properties through our trs we bear all operational risks and liabilities associated with the operation of these properties with limited exceptions such as a thirdparty operator’s gross negligence or willful misconduct these operational risks and liabilities include those relating to any employment matters of our operator compliance with healthcare and other laws and liabilities relating to personal injurytort matters residentpatient quality of care claims and any governmental reimbursement matters even though we have limited ability to control or influence our thirdparty operators’ management of these risks 

we view ridea as an important structure for senior housing properties that present attractive valuation entry points andor growth profiles and this structure has become the preferred structure as opposed to triplenet leases among most highquality operators in the senior housing industry many of the management agreements we have in ridea structures have terms ranging from 5 to 15 years with mutual renewal options the base management fees are typically 45 to 50 of gross revenues as defined in the respective management agreements generated by the ridea properties in addition there are sometimes incentive management fees payable to our thirdparty operators if operating results of the ridea properties exceed preestablished thresholds conversely there are sometimes provisions in the management agreements that reduce management fees payable to our thirdparty operators if operating results do not meet certain preestablished thresholds 

our senior housing property types under both triplenet leases and ridea structures are further described below 

 the following table provides information about our senior housing triplenet tenant concentration for the year ended december 31 2019  



 

 as thirdparty operators manage our ridea properties in exchange for the receipt of a management fee we are not directly exposed to the credit risk of these operators in the same manner or to the same extent as our triplenet tenants 

life science 

these properties contain laboratory and office space primarily for biotechnology medical device and pharmaceutical companies scientific research institutions government agencies and other organizations involved in the life science industry while these properties have characteristics similar to commercial office buildings they generally contain more advanced electrical mechanical heating ventilating and air conditioning systems the facilities generally have specialty equipment including emergency generators fume hoods lab bench tops and related amenities in many instances life science tenants make significant investments to improve their leased space in addition to landlord improvements to accommodate biology chemistry or medical device research initiatives 

life science properties are primarily configured in business park or campus settings and include multiple buildings the business park and campus settings allow us the opportunity to provide flexible contiguousadjacent expansion to accommodate the growth of existing tenants our properties are located in wellestablished geographical markets known for scientific research and drug discovery including san francisco 57 and san diego 25 california and boston massachusetts 12 based on square feet at december 31 2019  87 of our life science properties were triplenet leased based on leased square feet 

the following table provides information about our life science tenant concentration for the year ended december 31 2019  



medical office 

medical office buildings “mobs” typically contain physicians’ offices and examination rooms and may also include pharmacies hospital ancillary service space and outpatient services such as diagnostic centers rehabilitation clinics and daysurgery operating rooms while these facilities are similar to commercial office buildings they require additional plumbing electrical and mechanical systems to accommodate multiple exam rooms that may require sinks in every room and special equipment such as xray machines in addition mobs are often built to accommodate higher structural loads for certain equipment and may contain vaults or other specialized construction our mobs are typically multitenant properties leased to healthcare providers hospitals and physician practices with approximately 84 of our mobs located on hospital campuses and 95 affiliated with hospital systems based on square feet occasionally we invest in mobs located on hospital campuses subject to ground leases at december 31 2019  approximately 58 of our mobs were net leased based on leased square feet with the remaining leased under gross or modified gross leases 

the following table provides information about our medical office tenant concentration for the year ended december 31 2019  



other nonreportable segments 

at december 31 2019  we had interests in 11 hospitals and 10 debt investments additionally we had interests in 43 senior housing facilities 3 mobs and 2 postacuteskilled nursing facilities “snfs” owned and operated by our unconsolidated joint ventures services provided by our tenants and operators in hospitals are paid for by private sources thirdparty payors eg insurance and hmos or through medicare and medicaid programs our hospital property types include acute care longterm acute care and specialty and rehabilitation hospitals snfs offer restorative rehabilitative and custodial nursing care for people following a hospital stay or not requiring the more extensive and complex treatment available at hospitals all of our hospitals are triplenet leased 

competition 

investing in real estate serving the healthcare industry is highly competitive we face competition from other reits investment companies pension funds private equity investors sovereign funds healthcare operators lenders developers and other institutional investors some of whom may have greater flexibility eg nonreit competitors greater resources and lower costs of capital than we do increased competition makes it more challenging for us to identify and successfully capitalize on opportunities that meet our objectives our ability to compete may also be impacted by global national and local economic trends availability of investment alternatives availability and cost of capital construction and renovation costs existing laws and regulations new legislation and population trends 

income from our investments depends on our tenants’ and operators’ ability to compete with other companies on multiple levels including i the quality of care provided ii reputation iii success of product or drug development iv the physical appearance of a facility v price and range of services offered vi alternatives for healthcare delivery vii the supply of competing properties viii physicians ix staff x referral sources xi location xii the size and demographics of the population in surrounding areas and xiii the financial condition of our tenants and operators for a discussion of the risks associated with competitive conditions affecting our business see “item 1a risk factors” in this report 

government regulation licensing and enforcement 

overview 

our healthcare facility operators which include our trs entities when we use a ridea structure and tenants are typically subject to extensive and complex federal state and local healthcare laws and regulations relating to quality of care licensure and certificate of need government reimbursement fraud and abuse practices and similar laws governing the operation of healthcare facilities and we expect the healthcare industry in general will continue to face increased regulation and pressure in the areas of fraud waste and abuse cost control healthcare management and provision of services among others these regulations are wide ranging and can subject our tenants and operators to civil criminal and administrative sanctions affected tenants and operators may find it increasingly difficult to comply with this complex and evolving regulatory environment because of a relative lack of guidance in many areas as certain of our healthcare properties are subject to oversight from several government agencies and the laws may vary from one jurisdiction to another changes in laws regulations reimbursement enforcement activity and regulatory noncompliance by our tenants and operators can all have a significant effect on their operations and financial condition which in turn may adversely impact us as detailed below and set forth under “item 1a risk factors” in this report 

the following is a discussion of certain laws and regulations generally applicable to our operators and in certain cases to us 

fraud and abuse enforcement 

there are various extremely complex us federal and state laws and regulations governing healthcare providers’ relationships and arrangements and prohibiting fraudulent and abusive practices by such providers these laws include i us federal and state false claims acts which among other things prohibit providers from filing false claims or making false statements to receive payment from medicare medicaid or other us federal or state healthcare programs ii us federal and state antikickback and feesplitting statutes including the medicare and medicaid antikickback statute which prohibit or restrict the payment or receipt of remuneration to induce referrals or recommendations of healthcare items or services iii us federal and state physician selfreferral laws commonly referred to as the “stark law” which generally prohibit referrals by physicians to entities with which the physician or an immediate family member has a financial relationship and iv the federal civil monetary penalties law which prohibits among other things the knowing presentation of a false or fraudulent claim for certain healthcare services violations of us healthcare fraud and abuse laws carry civil criminal and administrative sanctions including punitive sanctions monetary penalties imprisonment denial of medicare and medicaid reimbursement and potential exclusion from medicare medicaid or other federal or state healthcare programs these laws are enforced by a variety of federal state and local agencies and in the us can also be enforced by private litigants through among other things federal and state false claims acts which allow private litigants to bring qui tam or “whistleblower” actions many of our tenants and operators are subject to these laws and may become the subject of governmental enforcement actions or whistleblower actions if they fail to comply with applicable laws additionally as of november 2019 the licensed operators of our us longterm care facilities that participate in government reimbursement programs are required to have compliance and ethics programs that meet the requirements of federal laws and regulations relating to the social security act consistent with ridea such responsibilities are delegated to our operating partners and we have developed a program to periodically monitor compliance with such obligations 

laws and regulations governing privacy and security 

there are various us federal and state privacy laws and regulations including the privacy and security rules contained in the health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 commonly referred to as “hipaa” which provide for the privacy and security of personal health information an increasing focus of the u s federal trade commission’s “ftc’s” consumer protection regulation is the impact of technological change on protection of consumer privacy the ftc as well as state attorneys general have taken enforcement action against companies that do not abide by their representations to consumers regarding electronic security and privacy to the extent we or our affiliated operating entities are a covered entity or business associate under hipaa and the health information technology for economic and clinical health act the “hitech act” compliance with those requirements would require us to among other things conduct a risk analysis implement a risk management plan implement policies and procedures and conduct employee training in most cases we are dependent on our tenants and management companies to fulfill our compliance obligations and we have developed a program to periodically monitor compliance with such obligations because of the far reaching nature of these laws there can be no assurance we would not be required to alter one or more of our systems and data security procedures to be in compliance with these laws our failure to protect health information could subject us to civil or criminal liability and adverse publicity and could harm our business and impair our ability to attract new customers and residents we may be required to notify individuals as well as government agencies and the media if we experience a data breach 

reimbursement 

sources of revenue for some of our tenants and operators include among others governmental healthcare programs such as the federal medicare programs and state medicaid programs and nongovernmental thirdparty payors such as insurance carriers and hmos as federal and state governments focus on healthcare reform initiatives and as the federal government and many states face significant current and future budget deficits efforts to reduce costs by these payors will likely continue which may result in reduced or slower growth in reimbursement for certain services provided by some of our tenants and operators additionally new and evolving payor and provider programs in the us including but not limited to medicare advantage dual eligible accountable care organizations and bundled payments could adversely impact our tenants’ and operators’ liquidity financial condition or results of operations 

healthcare licensure and certificate of need 

certain healthcare facilities in our portfolio are subject to extensive national federal state and local licensure certification and inspection laws and regulations a healthcare facility’s failure to comply with these laws and regulations could result in a revocation suspension restriction or nonrenewal of the facility’s license and loss of a certificate of need which could adversely affect the facility’s operations and ability to bill for items and services provided at the facility in addition various licenses and permits are required to handle controlled substances including narcotics operate pharmacies handle radioactive materials and operate equipment many states in the us require certain healthcare providers to obtain a certificate of need which requires prior approval for the construction expansion or closure of certain healthcare facilities the approval process related to state certificate of need laws may impact the ability of some of our tenants and operators to expand or change their businesses 

product approvals 

while our life science tenants include some wellestablished companies other tenants are less established and in some cases may not yet have a product approved by the food and drug administration or other regulatory authorities for commercial sale creating a new pharmaceutical product or medical device requires substantial investments of time and capital in part because of the extensive regulation of the healthcare industry it also entails considerable risk of failure in demonstrating that the product is safe and effective and in gaining regulatory approval and market acceptance 

senior housing entrance fee communities 

certain of our senior housing facilities primarily the ccrcs in our unconsolidated joint ventures are operated as entrance fee communities generally an entrance fee is an upfront fee or consideration paid by a resident a portion of which may be refundable in exchange for some form of longterm benefit typically consisting of a right to receive certain personal or health care services some of the entrance fee communities are subject to significant state regulatory oversight including for example oversight of each facility’s financial condition establishment and monitoring of reserve requirements and other financial restrictions the right of residents to cancel their contracts within a specified period of time the right of residents to receive a refund of their entrance fees lien rights in favor of the residents restrictions on change of ownership and similar matters 

americans with disabilities act “ada” 

our properties must comply with the ada and any similar state or local laws to the extent that such properties are “public accommodations” as defined in those statutes the ada may require removal of barriers to access by persons with disabilities in certain public areas of our properties where such removal is readily achievable to date we have not received any notices of noncompliance with the ada that have caused us to incur substantial capital expenditures to address ada concerns should barriers to access by persons with disabilities be discovered at any of our properties we may be directly or indirectly responsible for additional costs that may be required to make facilities adacompliant noncompliance with the ada could result in the imposition of fines or an award of damages to private litigants the obligation to make readily achievable accommodations pursuant to the ada is an ongoing one and we continue to assess our properties and make modifications as appropriate in this respect 

environmental matters 

a wide variety of federal state and local environmental and occupational health and safety laws and regulations affect healthcare facility operations these complex federal and state statutes and their enforcement involve a myriad of regulations many of which involve strict liability on the part of the potential offender some of these federal and state statutes may directly impact us under various federal state and local environmental laws ordinances and regulations an owner of real property or a secured lender such as us may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of hazardous or toxic substances at under or disposed of in connection with such property as well as other potential costs relating to hazardous or toxic substances including government fines and damages for injuries to persons and adjacent property the cost of any required remediation removal fines or personal or property damages and any related liability therefore could exceed or impair the value of the property andor the assets in addition the presence of such substances or the failure to properly dispose of or remediate such substances may adversely affect the value of such property and the owner’s ability to sell or rent such property or to borrow using such property as collateral which in turn could reduce our earnings for a description of the risks associated with environmental matters see “item 1a risk factors” in this report 

insurance 

we obtain various types of insurance to mitigate the impact of property business interruption liability flood windstorm earthquake fire environmental and terrorismrelated losses we attempt to obtain appropriate policy terms conditions limits and deductibles considering the relative risk of loss the cost of such coverage and current industry practice there are however certain types of extraordinary losses such as those due to acts of war or other events that may be either uninsurable or not economically insurable in addition we have a large number of properties that are exposed to earthquake flood and windstorm occurrences which carry higher deductibles 

we maintain property insurance for all of our properties tenants under triplenet leases primarily in our senior housing triplenet segment are required to provide primary property business interruption and liability insurance we maintain separate general and professional liability insurance for our shop facilities additionally our corporate general liability insurance program also extends coverage for all of our properties beyond the aforementioned we periodically review whether we or our ridea operators will bear responsibility for maintaining the required insurance coverage for the applicable shop properties but the costs of such insurance are facility expenses paid from the revenues of those properties regardless of who maintains the insurance 

we also maintain directors and officers liability insurance which provides protection for claims against our directors and officers arising from their responsibilities as directors and officers such insurance also extends to us in certain situations 

sustainability 

we believe that sustainability initiatives are a vital part of corporate responsibility which supports our primary goal of increasing stockholder value through profitable growth we continue to advance our commitment to sustainability with a focus on achieving goals in each of the environmental social and governance “esg” dimensions of sustainability 

our environmental management programs strive to capture cost efficiencies that ultimately benefit our investors tenants operators employees and other stakeholders while providing a positive impact on the communities in which we operate our social responsibility committee leads our local philanthropic and volunteer activities and our transparent corporate governance initiatives incorporate sustainability as a critical component in achieving our business objectives and properly managing risks 

our 2019 esg and sustainability achievements include being recognized by the cdp 2019 climate change program we completed cdp’s annual investor survey received a score of a for our disclosure and were named to the leadership band for the seventh consecutive year cdp collects and publishes the environmental data on behalf of more than 525 investors we were also named a constituent in the ftse4good index and achieved the green star designation from the global real estate sustainability benchmark gresb for the eighth consecutive year we were named a constituent in the north america dow jones sustainability index “djsi” for the seventh consecutive year the list is compiled according to the results of robecosam’s annual corporate sustainability assessment which also determines constituency for the djsi series in addition we were named to the bloomberg genderequality index investors’ business daily’s top 50 esg companies list and corporate responsibility magazine’s 100 best corporate citizens list we also won ethical boardroom’s corporate governance award for north american reits and nareit’s diversity and inclusion recognition award for additional information regarding our esg initiatives and our approach to climate change please visit our website at wwwhealthpeakcomcorporateresponsibility

 item 1a 

risk factors   

tableend the section below discusses the most significant risk factors that may materially adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

as set forth below we believe that the risks we face generally fall into the following categories 

 risks related to our business and operations 

we assume operational risks with respect to our shop properties managed in ridea structures that could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

ridea permits reits such as us to own or partially own qualified healthcare properties in a structure through which we can participate directly in the cash flow of the properties’ operations as compared to receiving only contractual rent payments under a triplenet lease in compliance with reit requirements the criteria for operating a qualified healthcare property in a ridea structure requires us to lease the property to an affiliate trs and for such affiliate trs to engage an independent qualifying management company or operator also known as an eligible independent contractor to manage and operate the daytoday business of the property the operator performs its services in exchange for a management fee as a result under a ridea structure we are required to rely on our operator to manage and operate the property including hiring and training all employees entering into all thirdparty contracts for the benefit of the property including residentpatient agreements complying with laws including but not limited to healthcare laws and providing resident care 

we have limited rights to direct or influence the business or operations of these properties however as the owner of the property under a ridea structure our trs and hence we are ultimately responsible for all operational risks and other liabilities of the property other than those arising out of certain actions by our operator such as gross negligence or willful misconduct operational risks include and our resulting revenues therefore depend on among other things i occupancy rates ii the entrance fees and rental rates charged to residents iii medicare and medicaid reimbursement rates to the extent applicable iv our operators’ reputations and ability to attract and retain residents v general economic conditions and market factors that impact seniors vi competition from other senior housing providers vii compliance with federal state local and industryregulated licensure certification and inspection laws regulations and standards viii litigation involving our properties or residentspatients ix the availability and cost of general and professional liability insurance coverage and x the ability to control operating expenses although we are permitted under a ridea structure to have certain general oversight approval rights eg budgets material contracts etc and the right to review operational and financial reporting information our operators are ultimately in control of the daytoday business of the property as a result we have limited rights to direct or influence the business or operations of our properties in the shop segment and we depend on our operators to operate these properties in a manner that complies with applicable law minimizes legal risk and maximizes the value of our investment the failure by our operators to adequately manage these risks could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

when we use a ridea structure our trs is generally required to be the holder of the applicable healthcare license and is the entity that is enrolled in government healthcare programs eg medicare medicaid where applicable as the holder of a healthcare license our trs and we through our ownership interest in our trs are subject to various regulatory laws most states regulate and inspect healthcare property operations patient care construction and the safety of the physical environment however we are required under ridea to rely on our operators to oversee and direct these aspects of the properties’ operations to ensure compliance with these applicable laws and regulations if one or more of our healthcare properties fails to comply with applicable laws our trs would be responsible except in limited circumstances such as the gross negligence or willful misconduct of our operators where we would have a contractual claim against them which could subject our trs to penalties including loss or suspension of licenses and certificates of need certification or accreditation exclusion from government healthcare programs ie medicare medicaid administrative sanctions and civil monetary penalties some states also reserve the right to sanction affiliates of a licensee when they take administrative action against the licensee additionally when we receive individually identifiable health information relating to residents of our healthcare properties we are subject to federal and state data privacy and security laws and rules and could be subject to liability in the event of an audit complaint cybersecurity attack or data breach furthermore our trs has exposure to professional liability claims that could arise out of resident claims such as quality of care and the associated litigation costs 

rents received from the trs in a ridea structure are treated as qualifying rents from real property for reit tax purposes only if i they are paid pursuant to a lease of a “qualified healthcare property” and ii the operator qualifies as an “eligible independent contractor” as defined in the internal revenue code of 1986 as amended the “code” if either of these requirements are not satisfied then the rents will not be qualifying rents 

decreases in our tenants’ operators’ or borrowers’ revenues or increases in their expenses could affect their ability to meet their financial and other contractual obligations to us 

our leases consist of triplenet leases in which we lease our properties directly to tenants and operators as well as ridea leases in which we lease our properties to an affiliate trs that enters into a management agreement with an eligible independent contractor or operator to manage and oversee the daytoday business and operations of the properties we are also a direct or indirect lender to various tenants and operators and separately provide loans to certain third parties we have very limited control over the success or failure of our tenants’ operators’ and borrowers’ businesses regardless of the structure of our relationship with them any of our triplenet tenants or operators under a ridea structure may experience a downturn in their business that materially weakens their financial condition as a result they may fail to make payments or perform their obligations when due although we generally have arrangements and other agreements that give us the right under specified circumstances to terminate a lease evict a tenant or terminate our operator or demand immediate repayment of outstanding loan amounts or other obligations to us we may not be able to enforce such rights or we may determine not to do so if we believe that enforcement of our rights would be more detrimental to our business than seeking alternative approaches 

our senior housing tenants and our shop segment under a ridea structure primarily depend on private sources for their revenues and the ability of their patients and residents to pay fees costs associated with independent and assisted living services are not generally reimbursable under governmental reimbursement programs such as medicare and medicaid accordingly our tenants and operators of our shop segments depend on attracting seniors with appropriate levels of income and assets which may be affected by many factors including i prevailing economic and market trends ii consumer confidence iii demographics iv property condition and v social and environmental factors consequently if our tenants or operators on our behalf fail to effectively conduct their operations or to maintain and improve our properties it could adversely affect our business reputation as the owner of the properties as well as the business reputation of our tenants or operators and their ability to attract and retain patients and residents in our properties which could have a materially adverse effect on our and our tenant’s or operator’s business results of operations and financial condition 

our senior housing tenants and our shop segment under a ridea structure also rely on reimbursements from governmental programs for a portion of the revenues from certain properties changes in reimbursement policies and other governmental regulation such as potential changes to or repeal of the patient protection and affordable care act along with the health care and education reconciliation act of 2010 the “affordable care act” that may result from actions by congress or executive orders may result in reductions in our tenants’ revenues or in our revenues from our ridea structures operations and cash flows and affect our tenants’ ability to meet their obligations to us or our financial performance through a ridea structure in addition failure to comply with reimbursement regulations or other laws applicable to healthcare providers could result in penalties fines litigation costs lost revenue or other consequences which could adversely impact our tenants’ ability to make contractual rent payments to us under a triplenet lease or our cash flows from operations under a ridea structure for a further discussion of the legislation and regulation that are applicable to us and our tenants operators and borrowers see “the requirements of or changes to government reimbursement programs such as medicare or medicaid may adversely affect our tenants’ operators’ and borrowers’ ability to meet their financial and other contractual obligations to us” 

revenues of our senior housing tenants and our shop segment under a ridea structure are also dependent on a number of other factors including licensed bed capacity occupancy the healthcare needs of residents the rate of reimbursement the income and assets of seniors in the regions in which we own properties and social and environmental factors for example due to generally increased vulnerability to illness a severe flu season an epidemic or any other widespread illness could result in early moveouts or delayed moveins during quarantine periods which would reduce our operators’ revenues additionally new and evolving payor and provider programs in the united states including but not limited to medicare advantage dual eligible accountable care organizations bundled payments and other valuebased reimbursement arrangements have resulted in reduced reimbursement rates average length of stay and average daily census particularly for higher acuity patients if our tenants fail to maintain revenues sufficient to meet their financial obligations to us our business results of operations and financial condition would be materially adversely affected similarly if our operators under a ridea structure underperform our business results of operations and financial condition would also be materially adversely affected 

increased competition operating costs and market changes have resulted and may further result in lower net revenues for some of our tenants operators and borrowers and may affect their ability to meet their financial and other contractual obligations to us 

the healthcare industry is highly competitive the occupancy levels at and rental income from our properties are dependent on our ability and the ability of our tenants operators and borrowers to compete with other tenants and operators on a number of different levels including the quality of care provided reputation the physical appearance of a property price the range of services offered family preference alternatives for healthcare delivery the supply of competing properties physicians staff referral sources location and the size and demographics of the population in the surrounding area in addition our tenants operators and borrowers face an increasingly competitive labor market for skilled management personnel and nurses an inability to attract and retain skilled management personnel and nurses and other trained personnel could negatively impact the ability of our tenants operators and borrowers to meet their obligations to us a shortage of nurses or other trained personnel union activities or general inflationary pressures on wages may force tenants operators and borrowers to enhance pay and benefits packages to compete effectively for skilled personnel or to use more expensive contract personnel but they be unable to offset these added costs by increasing the rates charged to residents any increase in labor costs and other property operating expenses or any failure by our tenants operators or borrowers to attract and retain qualified personnel could adversely affect our cash flow and have a materially adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

our tenants operators and borrowers also compete with numerous other companies providing similar healthcare services or alternatives such as home health agencies life care at home communitybased service programs retirement communities and convalescent centers this competition which is due in part to overdevelopment in some segments in which we invest has caused the occupancy rate of newly constructed buildings to slow and the monthly rate that many newly built and previously existing properties were able to obtain for their services to decrease our tenants operators and borrowers may be unable to achieve occupancy and rate levels and to manage their expenses in a way that will enable them to meet all of their obligations to us further many competing companies may have resources and attributes that are superior to those of our tenants operators and borrowers our tenants operators and borrowers may encounter increased competition that could limit their ability to maintain or attract residents or expand their businesses or to manage their expenses which could materially adversely affect their ability to meet their financial and other contractual obligations to us potentially decreasing our revenues impairing our assets andor increasing collection and dispute costs 

the financial deterioration insolvency or bankruptcy of one or more of our major tenants operators or borrowers could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

a downturn in any of our tenants’ operators’ or borrowers’ businesses could ultimately lead to voluntary or involuntary bankruptcy or similar insolvency proceedings including but not limited to assignment for the benefit of creditors liquidation or windingup bankruptcy and insolvency laws afford certain rights to a defaulting tenant operator or borrower that has filed for bankruptcy or reorganization that may render certain of our remedies unenforceable or at the least delay our ability to pursue such remedies and realize any related recoveries for example we cannot evict a tenant or operator solely because of its bankruptcy filing 

a debtor has the right to assume or to assume and assign to a third party or to reject its executory contracts and unexpired leases in a bankruptcy proceeding if a debtor were to reject its leases with us obligations under such rejected leases would cease the claim against the rejecting debtor would be an unsecured claim which would be limited by the statutory cap set forth in the us bankruptcy code this statutory cap may be substantially less than the remaining rent actually owed under the lease in addition a debtor may also assert in bankruptcy proceedings that leases should be recharacterized as financing agreements which could result in our being deemed a lender instead of a landlord a lender’s rights and remedies as compared to a landlord’s generally are materially less favorable and our rights as a lender may be subordinated to other creditors’ rights 

furthermore the automatic stay provisions of the us bankruptcy code would preclude us from enforcing our remedies unless we first obtain relief from the court having jurisdiction over the bankruptcy case this would effectively limit or delay our ability to collect unpaid rent or interest payments and we may ultimately not receive any payment at all in addition we would likely be required to fund certain expenses and obligations eg real estate taxes insurance debt costs and maintenance expenses to preserve the value of our properties avoid the imposition of liens on our properties or transition our properties to a new tenant or operator additionally we lease many of our properties to healthcare providers who provide longterm custodial care to the elderly evicting operators for failure to pay rent while the property is occupied typically involves specific procedural or regulatory requirements and may not be successful even if eviction is possible we may determine not to do so due to reputational or other risks bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings typically also result in increased costs to the operator significant management distraction and performance declines 

if we are unable to transition affected properties they would likely experience prolonged operational disruption leading to lower occupancy rates and further depressed revenues publicity about the operator’s financial condition and insolvency proceeds may also negatively impact their and our reputations decreasing customer demand and revenues any or all of these risks could have a material adverse effect on our revenues results of operations and cash flows these risks would be magnified where we lease multiple properties to a single operator under a master lease as an operator failure or default under a master lease would expose us to these risks across multiple properties 

we depend on investments in the healthcare property sector making our profitability more vulnerable to a downturn or slowdown in that specific sector than if we were investing in multiple industries 

we concentrate our investments in the healthcare property sector as a result we are subject to risks inherent to investments in a single industry a downturn or slowdown in the healthcare property sector would have a greater adverse impact on our business than if we had investments in multiple industries specifically such a downturn or slowdown could negatively impact the ability of our tenants operators and borrowers to meet their obligations to us as well as the ability to maintain rental and occupancy rates which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations in addition a downturn or slowdown in the healthcare property sector could adversely affect the value of our properties and our ability to sell properties at prices or on terms acceptable or favorable to us 

in addition we are exposed to the risks inherent in concentrating our investments in real estate our real estate investments are relatively illiquid due to several factors including but not limited to i restrictions on our ability to sell properties under applicable reit tax laws ii other taxrelated considerations iii regulatory hurdles and iv market conditions our ability to quickly sell or transition any of our properties in response to changes in the performance of our properties or economic and other conditions is limited we may be unable to recognize full value for any property that we seek to sell for liquidity reasons our inability to timely respond to investment performance changes could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

tenants and operators that fail to comply with federal state local and international laws and regulations including licensure certification and inspection requirements may cease to operate or be unable to meet their financial and other contractual obligations to us 

our tenants operators and borrowers are subject to or impacted by extensive frequently changing federal state local and international laws and regulations these laws and regulations include among others i laws protecting consumers against deceptive practices ii laws relating to the operation of our properties and how our tenants and operators conduct their business such as fire health and safety data security and privacy laws iii federal and state laws affecting hospitals clinics and other healthcare communities that participate in both medicare and medicaid that specify reimbursement rates pricing reimbursement procedures and limitations quality of services and care background checks food service and physical plants and similar foreign laws regulating the healthcare industry resident rights laws including abuse and neglect laws and fraud laws iv antikickback and physician referral laws v the ada and similar state and local laws and vi safety and health standards set by the occupational safety and health administration or similar foreign agencies certain of our properties may also require a license registration andor certificate of need to operate 

our tenants’ operators’ or borrowers’ failure to comply with any of these laws regulations or requirements could result in i loss of accreditation denial of reimbursement ii imposition of fines suspension or decertification from government healthcare programs iii civil liability and iv in certain instances criminal penalties loss of license or closure of the property andor the incurrence of considerable costs arising from an investigation or regulatory action which may have an adverse effect on properties that we own and lease to a third party tenant that we own and operate through a ridea structure or on which we hold a mortgage and therefore may materially adversely impact us see “item 1businessgovernment regulation licensing and enforcementhealthcare licensure and certificate of need” 

we may have difficulty identifying and securing replacement tenants or operators and we may be required to incur substantial renovation or tenant improvement costs to make our properties suitable for them 

our tenants may not renew existing leases and our operators may not renew their management agreements beyond their current terms if we or our tenants or operators terminate or do not renew the leases or management agreements for our properties we would attempt to reposition those properties with another tenant or operator we may also voluntarily change operators for a variety of reasons for example we transitioned a significant number of properties managed by brookdale to other operators as part of our strategic plan to reduce our brookdale concentration healthcare properties are typically highly customized the improvements generally required to conform a property to healthcare use such as upgrading electrical gas and plumbing infrastructure are costly and at times tenantspecific and are typically subject to regulatory requirements a new or replacement tenant or operator may require different features in a property depending on that tenant’s or operator’s particular business in addition infrastructure improvements for life science properties typically are significantly more costly than improvements to other property types due to the highly specialized nature of the properties and the greater lease square footage often required by life science tenants we may be unable to recover part or all of these higher costs therefore if a current tenant or operator is unable to pay rent andor vacates a property we may incur substantial expenditures to modify a property and experience delays before we are able to secure another tenant or operator or to accommodate multiple tenants or operators these expenditures or renovations and delays may have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

additionally we may fail to identify suitable replacements or enter into leases management agreements or other arrangements with new tenants or operators on a timely basis or on terms as favorable to us as our current leases if at all furthermore during transition periods to new tenants or operators we anticipate that the attention of existing tenants or operators will be diverted from the performance of the properties which would cause the financial and operational performance at these properties to decline for example the brookdale properties we intended to sell or transition performed significantly worse during the transition period than our senior housing properties as a whole following a decline in performance we may not be able to rehabilitate the property to previous performance levels which would adversely impact our results of operations we also may be required to fund certain expenses and obligations such as real estate taxes debt costs and maintenance expenses to preserve the value of and avoid the imposition of liens on our properties while they are being repositioned in addition we may incur certain obligations and liabilities including obligations to indemnify the replacement tenant or operator which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

we face additional risks associated with property development and redevelopment that can render a project less profitable or not profitable at all and under certain circumstances prevent completion of development or redevelopment activities once undertaken 

property development and redevelopment is a significant component of our growth strategy at december 31 2019  our active development and redevelopment pipeline was approximately 14 billion with remaining costs to complete of approximately 758 million  largescale groundup healthcare property development presents additional risks for us including risks that 

 any of the foregoing risks could result in not achieving our expected return on investment and have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

changes within the life science industry may adversely impact our revenues and results of operations 

for the year ended december 31 2019  properties in our life science segment accounted for approximately 22 of our total revenues our life science investments could be adversely affected if the life science industry is impacted by an economic financial or banking crisis or if the life science industry migrates from the us to other countries or to areas outside of primary life science markets in south san francisco california san diego california and greater boston massachusetts our ability to negotiate contractual rent escalations on future leases and to achieve increases in rental rates will depend upon market conditions and the demand for life science properties at the time the leases are negotiated and the increases are proposed if economic financial or industry conditions adversely affect our life science tenants we may not be able to lease or release our properties in a timely manner or at favorable rates which would negatively impact our revenues and results of operations for example some of our properties may be better suited for a particular life science industry client tenant and could require modification before we are able to release vacant space to another life science industry client tenant which may delay the releasing process and result in unrecovered costs additionally some of our life science properties may not be suitable for lease to traditional office client tenants without significant expenditures on renovations which could delay an attempt to reposition the property for rent to nonlife science tenants because infrastructure improvements for life science properties typically are significantly more costly than improvements to other property types due to the highly specialized nature of the properties and life science tenants typically require greater lease square footage relative to medical office tenants repositioning efforts would have a disproportionate adverse effect on our life science segment performance see “we may have difficulty identifying and securing replacement tenants or operators and we may be required to incur substantial renovation or tenant improvement costs to make our properties suitable for them” 

it is common for businesses in the life science industry to undergo mergers or consolidations future mergers or consolidations of life science entities could reduce the amount of rentable square footage requirements of our client tenants and prospective client tenants which may adversely impact our revenues from lease payments and results of operations 

our tenants in the life science industry face high levels of regulation funding requirements expense and uncertainty 

life science tenants particularly those involved in developing and marketing pharmaceutical products are subject to certain unique risks including the following 

 if our tenants’ businesses are adversely affected they may fail to make their rent payments to us which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

the hospitals on whose campuses our mobs are located and their affiliated healthcare systems could fail to remain competitive or financially viable which could adversely impact their ability to attract physicians and physician groups to our mobs and our other properties that serve the healthcare industry 

our mobs and other properties that serve the healthcare industry depend on the competitiveness and financial viability of the hospitals on whose campuses our mobs are located and their affiliated healthcare systems in order to attract physicians and other healthcarerelated users the viability of these hospitals in turn depends on factors such as i the quality and mix of healthcare services provided ii competition for patients and physicians iii demographic trends in the surrounding community iv market position and v growth potential as well as the ability of the affiliated healthcare systems to provide economies of scale and access to capital if a hospital whose campus is located on or near one of our mobs is unable to meet its financial obligations and if an affiliated healthcare system is unable to support that hospital the hospital may not be able to compete successfully or could be forced to close or relocate which could adversely impact its ability to attract physicians and other healthcarerelated users because we rely on our proximity to and affiliations with these hospitals to create tenant demand for space in our mobs their inability to remain competitive or financially viable or to attract physicians and physician groups could adversely affect our mob operations and have a material adverse effect on us 

in addition changes to or replacement of the affordable care act and related regulations could result in significant changes to the scope of insurance coverage and reimbursement policies which could put negative pressure on the operations and revenues of our mobs 

we may be unable to maintain or expand our relationships with our existing and future hospital and health system clients 

the success of our medical office portfolio depends to a large extent on past current and future relationships with hospitals and their affiliated health systems we invest significant amounts of time in developing relationships with both new and existing clients if we fail to maintain these relationships including through a lack of responsiveness failure to adapt to the current market or employment of individuals with inadequate experience our reputation and relationships will be harmed and we may lose business to competitors if our relationships with hospitals and their affiliated health systems deteriorate it could have a material adverse effect on us 

economic and other conditions that negatively affect geographic areas from which a greater percentage of our revenue is recognized could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

for the year ended december 31 2019  we derived 28 of our revenue from properties located in california which is also where a large portion of our life science portfolio is located as a result we are subject to increased exposure to adverse conditions affecting california including i downturns in local economies ii changes in local real estate conditions including increases in real estate taxes iii increased competition iv decreased demand v changes in statespecific legislation and vi local climate events and natural disasters such as earthquakes windstorms flooding wildfires and mudslides these risks could significantly disrupt our businesses in the region harm our ability to compete effectively result in increased costs and divert management attention any or all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

in addition if significant changes in the climate occur in areas where we own property this could result in physical damage to or a decrease in demand for properties located in these areas or affected by these conditions if changes in the climate have material effects such as property destruction or occur for extended periods this could have a material adverse effect on business results of operations and financial condition in addition changes in federal state and local legislation and regulation on climate change could require increased capital expenditures to improve the energy efficiency of our existing properties and could also cause increased costs for our new developments without a corresponding increase in revenue 

uninsured or underinsured losses could result in a significant loss of capital invested in a property lower than expected future revenues and unanticipated expense 

we maintain and regularly review the comprehensive insurance coverage on our properties with terms conditions limits and deductibles that we believe are adequate and appropriate given the relative risk and costs of such coverage however a large number of our properties are located in areas exposed to earthquake windstorm flood and other natural disasters in particular a significant portion of our life science development projects and approximately 80 of our existing life science portfolio based on gross asset value is concentrated in california which is known to be subject to earthquakes wildfires and other natural disasters while we purchase insurance coverage for earthquake fire windstorm flood and other natural disasters that we believe is adequate in light of current industry practice and analyses prepared by outside consultants such insurance may not fully cover such losses these losses can result in decreased anticipated revenues from a property and the loss of all or a portion of the capital we have invested in a property following these events we may remain liable for any mortgage debt or other financial obligations related to the property 

furthermore the insurance market for natural disasters exposures can be volatile and we may be unable to purchase the limits and terms we desire on a commercially reasonable basis in addition there are certain exposures for which we do not purchase insurance because we do not believe it is economically feasible to do so or there is no viable insurance market we maintain earthquake insurance for our properties that are located in the vicinity of active earthquake zones in amounts and with deductibles we believe are commercially reasonable because of our significant concentration in the seismically active regions of south san francisco california and san diego california a damaging earthquake in these areas could significantly impact multiple properties which may amount to a significant portion of our life science portfolio as a result aggregate deductible amounts may be material and our insurance coverage may be materially insufficient to cover our losses either of which would adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

if one of our properties experiences a loss that is uninsured or that exceeds policy coverage limits we could lose our investment in the damaged property as well as the anticipated future cash flows from such property if the damaged property is subject to recourse indebtedness we could continue to be liable for the indebtedness even if the property is irreparably damaged 

in addition even if damage to our properties is covered by insurance a disruption of business caused by a casualty event may result in loss of revenues for us any business interruption insurance may not fully compensate the lender or us for such loss of revenue 

our use of joint ventures may limit our flexibility with jointly owned investments 

we have and may continue to develop andor acquire properties in joint ventures with other persons or entities when circumstances warrant the use of these structures our participation in joint ventures is subject to risks that may not be present with other methods of ownership including 

 with respect to our joint ventures we are limited in our ability to control or influence operations and in our ability to exit or transfer our interest in the joint venture to a third party as a result we may not receive full value for our ownership interest if we tried to sell it to a third party 

in addition in some instances we andor our joint venture partner will have the right to cause us to sell our interest or acquire our partner’s interest at a time when we otherwise would not have initiated such a transaction our ability to acquire our partner’s interest will be limited if we do not have sufficient cash available borrowing capacity or other capital resources this would require us to sell our interest in the joint venture when we would otherwise prefer to retain it any of the foregoing risks could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

we have now and may have in the future contingent rent provisions andor rent escalators based on the consumer price index which could hinder our profitability and growth 

we derive a significant portion of our revenues from leasing properties pursuant to leases that generally provide for fixed rental rates subject to annual escalations under certain leases a portion of the tenant’s rental payment to us is based on the property’s revenues ie contingent rent if as a result of weak economic conditions or other factors the property’s revenue declines our rental revenues would decrease and our results of operations could be materially adversely affected additionally some of our leases provide that annual rent escalates based on changes in the consumer price index or other thresholds ie contingent rent escalators if the consumer price index does not increase or other applicable thresholds are not met rental rates may not increase and our growth and profitability may be hindered furthermore if strong economic conditions result in significant increases in the consumer price index but the escalations under our leases with contingent rent escalators are capped our growth and profitability also may be limited 

competition may make it difficult to identify and purchase or develop suitable healthcare properties to grow our investment portfolio to finance acquisitions on favorable terms or to retain or attract tenants and operators 

we face significant competition from other reits investment companies private equity and hedge fund investors sovereign funds healthcare operators lenders developers and other institutional investors some of whom may have greater resources and lower costs of capital than we do increased competition makes it more challenging for us to identify and successfully capitalize on opportunities that meet our business goals and could improve the bargaining power of property owners seeking to sell thereby impeding our investment acquisition and development activities similarly our properties face competition for tenants and operators from other properties in the same market which may affect our ability to attract and retain tenants and operators or may reduce the rents we are able to charge if we cannot capitalize on our development pipeline identify and purchase a sufficient quantity of healthcare properties at favorable prices finance acquisitions on commercially favorable terms or attract and retain profitable tenants and operators our business results of operations and financial condition may be materially adversely affected 

from time to time we have made and we may seek to make one or more material acquisitions which may involve the expenditure of significant funds 

we regularly review potential transactions in order to maximize stockholder value our review process may require significant management attention and a potential transaction could be abandoned or rejected by us or the other parties involved after we expend significant resources and time in addition future acquisitions may require the issuance of securities the incurrence of debt assumption of contingent liabilities or incurrence of significant expenditures each of which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations in addition the financing required for acquisitions may not be available on commercially favorable terms or at all 

from time to time we may acquire other companies and if we are unable to successfully integrate these operations our business results of operations and financial condition may be materially adversely affected 

acquisitions require the integration of companies that have previously operated independently successful integration of acquired companies depends primarily on our ability to consolidate operations systems procedures properties and personnel and to eliminate redundancies and reduce costs we may encounter difficulties in these integrations potential difficulties associated with acquisitions include i our ability to effectively monitor and manage our expanded portfolio of properties ii the loss of key employees iii the disruption of our ongoing business or that of the acquired entity iv possible inconsistencies in standards controls procedures and policies and v the assumption of unexpected liabilities including 

 in addition acquired companies and their properties may fail to perform as expected including in respect of estimated cost savings inaccurate assumptions regarding future rental or occupancy rates could result in overly optimistic estimates of future revenues similarly we may underestimate future operating expenses or the costs necessary to bring properties up to standards established for their intended use or for property improvements 

if we have difficulties with any of these areas or if we later discover additional liabilities or experience unforeseen costs relating to our acquired companies we may not achieve the anticipated economic benefits from our acquisitions and this may have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

our tenants operators and borrowers face litigation and may experience rising liability and insurance costs 

in some states advocacy groups have been created to monitor the quality of care at healthcare properties and these groups have brought litigation against the tenants and operators of such properties also in several instances private litigation by patients residents or “whistleblowers” has sought and sometimes resulted in large damage awards see “the requirements of or changes to governmental reimbursement programs such as medicare or medicaid may adversely affect our tenants’ operators’ and borrowers’ ability to meet their financial and other contractual obligations to us” the effect of this litigation and other potential litigation may materially increase the costs incurred by our tenants operators and borrowers for monitoring and reporting quality of care compliance which under a ridea structure would be borne by us in addition their cost of liability and medical malpractice insurance can be significant and may increase or not be available at a reasonable cost cost increases could cause our tenants and borrowers to be unable to make their lease or mortgage payments or fail to purchase the appropriate liability and malpractice insurance or cause our borrowers to be unable to meet their obligations to us potentially decreasing our revenues and increasing our collection and litigation costs furthermore with respect to our senior housing properties operated in ridea structures we directly bear the costs of any such increases in litigation monitoring reporting and insurance due to our direct exposure to the cash flows of such properties 

in addition as a result of our ownership of healthcare properties we may be named as a defendant in lawsuits arising from the alleged actions of our tenants or operators with respect to our triplenet leases our tenants generally have agreed to indemnify us for various claims litigation and liabilities in connection with their leasing and operation of our triplenet leased properties 

with respect to our ridea structured properties we are responsible for these claims litigation and liabilities with limited indemnification rights against our operator typically based on the gross negligence or willful misconduct by the operator although our leases provide us with certain information rights with respect to our tenants one or more of our tenants may be or become party to pending litigation or investigation to which we are unaware or do not have a right to participate or evaluate in such cases we would be unable to determine the potential impact of such litigation or investigation on our tenants or our business or results moreover negative publicity of any of our operators’ or tenants’ litigation other legal proceedings or investigations may also negatively impact their and our reputation resulting in lower customer demand and revenues which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flow 

required regulatory approvals can delay or prohibit transfers of our healthcare properties 

transfers of healthcare properties to successor tenants or operators are typically subject to regulatory approvals or ratifications including but not limited to change of ownership approvals and medicare and medicaid provider arrangements that are not required for transfers of other types of commercial operations and other types of real estate the replacement of any tenant or operator could be delayed by the regulatory approval process of any federal state or local government agency necessary for the transfer of the property or the replacement of the operator licensed to manage the property during which time the property may experience performance declines if we are unable to find a suitable replacement tenant or operator upon favorable terms or at all we may take possession of a property which could expose us to successor liability require us to indemnify subsequent operators to whom we transfer the operating rights and licenses or require us to spend substantial time and funds to preserve the value of the property and adapt the property to other uses all of which could have a material adverse effect of our business results of operations and financial condition 

compliance with the americans with disabilities act and fire safety and other regulations may require us to make expenditures that adversely affect our cash flows 

our properties must comply with applicable ada and any similar state and local laws this may require removal of barriers to access by persons with disabilities in public areas of our properties noncompliance could result in the incurrence of additional costs associated with bringing the properties into compliance the imposition of fines or an award of damages to private litigants in individual lawsuits or as part of a class action while the tenants to whom we lease our properties are obligated to comply with the ada and similar state and local provisions and typically under tenant leases are obligated to cover costs associated with compliance if required changes involve greater expenditures than anticipated or if the changes must be made on a more accelerated basis than anticipated the ability of these tenants to cover costs could be adversely affected as a result we could be required to expend funds to comply with the provisions of the ada and similar state and local laws on behalf of tenants which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition additionally with respect to our shop properties under ridea structures we are ultimately responsible for such litigation and compliance costs 

in addition we are required to operate our properties in compliance with fire and safety regulations building codes and other land use regulations new and revised regulations and codes may be adopted by governmental agencies and bodies and become applicable to our properties for example new safety laws for senior housing properties were adopted following the particularly damaging 2018 hurricane season compliance could require substantial capital expenditures and may restrict our ability to renovate our properties these expenditures and restrictions could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and cash flows 

the requirements of or changes to governmental reimbursement programs such as medicare or medicaid may adversely affect our tenants’ operators’ and borrowers’ ability to meet their financial and other contractual obligations to us 

certain of our tenants operators and borrowers are affected directly or indirectly by a complex set of federal state and local laws and regulations pertaining to governmental reimbursement programs these laws and regulations are subject to frequent and substantial changes that are sometimes applied retroactively see “item 1businessgovernment regulation licensing and enforcement” for example to the extent that our tenants operators or borrowers receive a significant portion of their revenues from governmental payors primarily medicare and medicaid they are generally subject to among other things 



 the failure to comply with the extensive laws regulations and other requirements applicable to their business and the operation of our properties could result in among other challenges i becoming ineligible to receive reimbursement from governmental reimbursement programs ii becoming subject to prepayment reviews or claims for overpayments iii bans on admissions of new patients or residents iv civil or criminal penalties and v significant operational changes including requirements to increase staffing or the scope of care given to residents these laws and regulations are enforced by a variety of federal state and local agencies and can also be enforced by private litigants through among other things federal and state false claims acts which allow private litigants to bring qui tam or “whistleblower” actions 

we are unable to predict future changes to or interpretations of federal state and local statutes and regulations including the medicare and medicaid statutes and regulations or the intensity of enforcement efforts with respect to such statutes and regulations any changes in the regulatory framework or the intensity or extent of governmental or private enforcement actions could have a material adverse effect on our tenants and operators if in turn such tenants or operators fail to make contractual rent payments to us or with respect to our shop segment cash flows are adversely affected it could have a material adverse effect on us 

sometimes governmental payors freeze or reduce payments to healthcare providers or provide annual reimbursement rate increases that are smaller than expected due to budgetary and other pressures in addition the federal government periodically makes changes in the statutes and regulations relating to medicare and medicaid reimbursement that may impact state reimbursement programs particularly medicaid reimbursement we cannot make any assessment as to the ultimate timing or the effect that any future changes may have on our tenants’ operators’ and borrowers’ costs of doing business and on the amount of reimbursement by government and other thirdparty payors the failure of any of our tenants operators or borrowers to comply with these laws and regulations and significant limits on the scope of services reimbursed reductions in reimbursement rates and fees or increases in provider or similar types of taxes could materially adversely affect their ability to meet their financial and contractual obligations to us 

furthermore executive orders and legislation may amend or repeal the affordable care act and related regulations in whole or in part we also anticipate that congress state legislatures and thirdparty payors may continue to review and assess alternative healthcare delivery and payment systems and may propose and adopt legislation or policy changes or implementations effecting additional fundamental changes in the healthcare system for example the department of health and human services has focused on tying medicare payments to quality or value through alternative payment models which generally aim to make providers attentive to the total costs of treatments medicare no longer reimburses hospitals for care related to certain preventable adverse events and imposes payment reductions on hospitals for preventable readmissions these punitive approaches could be expanded to additional types of providers in the future additionally the centers for medicare and medicaid services recently finalized a new patient driven payment model used to calculate reimbursement rates for patients in skilled nursing properties while we cannot quantify or predict the likely impact of these changes on the revenues and profitability of our tenants operators and borrowers these provisions could result in decreases in payments to our operators and tenants or increase our operators’ and tenants’ costs if any such changes significantly and adversely affect our tenants’ profitability they could in turn negatively affect our tenants’ ability and willingness to comply with the terms of their leases with us andor renew their leases with us upon expiration which could impact our business prospects financial condition or results of operations 

legislation to address federal government operations and administration decisions affecting the centers for medicare and medicaid services could have a material adverse effect on our tenants’ operators’ and borrowers’ liquidity financial condition or results of operations 

congressional consideration of legislation pertaining to the federal debt ceiling the affordable care act tax reform and entitlement programs including reimbursement rates for physicians could have a material adverse effect on our tenants’ operators’ and borrowers’ liquidity financial condition or results of operations in particular reduced funding for entitlement programs such as medicare and medicaid would result in increased costs and fees for programs such as medicare advantage plans and additional reductions in reimbursements to providers amendments to or repeal of the affordable care act in whole or in part and decisions by the centers for medicare and medicaid services could impact the delivery of services and benefits under medicare medicaid or medicare advantage plans and could affect our tenants and operators and the manner in which they are reimbursed by such programs such changes could have a material adverse effect on our tenants’ operators’ and borrowers’ liquidity financial condition or results of operations which could adversely affect their ability to satisfy their obligations to us and could have a material adverse effect on us 

we may be unable to successfully foreclose on the collateral securing our real estaterelated loans and even if we are successful in our foreclosure efforts we may be unable to successfully operate occupy or reposition the underlying real estate which may adversely affect our ability to recover our investments 

if a tenant or operator defaults under one of our mortgages or mezzanine loans we may have to foreclose on the loan or protect our interest by acquiring title to the collateral and thereafter making substantial improvements or repairs in order to maximize the property’s investment potential in some cases the collateral consists of the equity interests in an entity that directly or indirectly owns the applicable real property or interests in operating properties and accordingly we may not have full recourse to assets of that entity or that entity may have incurred unexpected liabilities tenants operators or borrowers may contest enforcement of foreclosure or other remedies seek bankruptcy protection against our exercise of enforcement or other remedies andor bring claims for lender liability in response to actions to enforce mortgage obligations foreclosurerelated costs high loantovalue ratios or declines in the value of the property may prevent us from realizing an amount equal to our mortgage or mezzanine loan upon foreclosure and we may be required to record a valuation allowance for such losses even if we are able to successfully foreclose on the collateral securing our real estaterelated loans we may inherit properties for which we may be unable to expeditiously secure tenants or operators if at all or we may acquire equity interests that we are unable to immediately resell due to limitations under the securities laws either of which would adversely affect our ability to fully recover our investment 

risks related to our capital structure and market conditions 

changes or increases in interest rates could result in a decrease in our stock price and increased interest costs on new debt and existing variable rate debt which could materially adversely impact our ability to refinance existing debt sell properties and conduct acquisition investment and development activities 

an increase in interest rates could reduce the amount investors are willing to pay for our common stock because reit stocks are often perceived as highyield investments investors may perceive less relative benefit to owning reit stocks as interest rates and the yield on government treasuries and other bonds increase 

additionally we have existing debt obligations that are variable rate obligations with interest and related payments that vary with the movement of certain indices if interest rates increase so would our interest costs for any variable rate debt and for new debt this increased cost would make the financing of any acquisition and development activity more costly in addition an increase in interest rates could decrease the amount third parties are willing to pay for our properties thereby limiting our ability to reposition our portfolio promptly in response to changes in economic or other conditions 

rising interest rates could limit our ability to refinance existing debt when it matures or cause us to pay higher interest rates upon refinancing and increase interest expense on refinanced indebtedness if prevailing interest rates are higher than the interest rates of our senior notes at their maturity we will incur additional interest expense upon any replacement debt 

we manage a portion of our exposure to interest rate risk by accessing debt with staggered maturities and through the use of derivative instruments primarily interest rate swap agreements however no amount of hedging activity can fully insulate us from the risks associated with changes in interest rates swap agreements involve risk including that counterparties may fail to honor their obligations under these arrangements that these arrangements may not be effective in reducing our exposure to interest rate changes that the amount of income we earn from hedging transactions may be limited by federal tax provisions governing reits and that these arrangements may cause us to pay higher interest rates on our debt obligations than would otherwise be the case failure to hedge effectively against interest rate risk could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

cash available for distribution to stockholders may be insufficient to make dividend distributions at expected levels and are made at the discretion of our board of directors 

if cash available for distribution generated by our properties decreases as a result of our announced dispositions or otherwise we may be unable to make dividend distributions at expected levels our inability to make expected distributions would likely result in a decrease in the market price of our common stock all distributions are made at the discretion of our board of directors in accordance with maryland law and depend on i our earnings ii our financial condition iii debt and equity capital available to us iv our expectations for future capital requirements and operating performance v restrictive covenants in our financial or other contractual arrangements including those in our credit facility agreement vi maintenance of our reit qualification vii restrictions under maryland law and viii other factors as our board of directors may deem relevant from time to time additionally our ability to make distributions will be adversely affected if any of the risks described herein or other significant adverse events occur 

we rely on external sources of capital to fund future capital needs and if access to such capital is unavailable on acceptable terms or at all it could have a material adverse effect on our ability to meet commitments as they become due or make future investments necessary to grow our business 

we may not be able to fund all future capital needs including capital expenditures debt maturities and other commitments from cash retained from operations and dispositions if we are unable to obtain enough internal capital we may need to rely on external sources of capital including debt and equity financing to fulfill our capital requirements our access to capital depends upon a number of factors some of which we have little or no control over including but not limited to 

 if access to capital is unavailable on acceptable terms or at all it could have material adverse impact on our ability to fund operations repay or refinance our debt obligations fund dividend payments acquire properties and make the investments needed to grow our business 

adverse changes in our credit ratings could impair our ability to obtain additional debt and equity financing on favorable terms if at all and negatively impact the market price of our securities including our common stock 

our credit ratings can affect the amount and type of capital we can access as well as the terms of any financing we may obtain the credit ratings of our senior unsecured debt are based on among other things our operating performance liquidity and leverage ratios overall financial position level of indebtedness and pending or future changes in the regulatory framework applicable to our operators and our industry we may be unable to maintain our current credit ratings and in the event that our current credit ratings deteriorate we would likely incur higher borrowing costs which would make it more difficult or expensive to obtain additional financing or refinance existing obligations and commitments also a downgrade in our credit ratings would trigger additional costs or other potentially negative consequences under our current and future credit facilities and debt instruments 

our level of indebtedness may increase and materially adversely affect our future operations 

our outstanding indebtedness as of december 31 2019 was approximately 64 billion  we may incur additional indebtedness including in connection with the development or acquisition of properties which may be substantial any significant additional indebtedness would likely negatively affect the credit ratings of our debt and require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow to interest and principal payments due on our indebtedness greater demands on our cash resources may reduce funds available to us to pay dividends conduct development activities make capital expenditures and acquisitions or carry out other aspects of our business strategy increased indebtedness can also make us more vulnerable to general adverse economic and industry conditions and create competitive disadvantages for us compared to other companies with relatively lower debt levels increased future debt service obligations may limit our operational flexibility including our ability to finance or refinance our properties contribute properties to joint ventures or sell properties as needed 

covenants in our debt instruments limit our operational flexibility and breaches of these covenants could materially adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

the terms of our current secured and unsecured debt instruments and other indebtedness that we may incur require or will require us to comply with a number of customary financial and other covenants such as maintaining leverage ratios minimum tangible net worth requirements reit status and certain levels of debt service coverage our continued ability to incur additional debt and to conduct business in general is subject to compliance with these financial and other covenants which limit our operational flexibility for example mortgages on our properties contain customary covenants such as those that limit or restrict our ability without the consent of the lender to further encumber or sell the applicable properties or to replace the applicable tenant or operator breaches of certain covenants may result in defaults under the mortgages on our properties and crossdefaults under certain of our other indebtedness even if we satisfy our payment obligations to the respective obligee covenants that limit our operational flexibility as well as defaults resulting from the breach of any of these covenants could materially adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

volatility disruption or uncertainty in the financial markets may impair our ability to raise capital obtain new financing or refinance existing obligations and fund real estate and development activities 

we may be affected by general market and economic conditions increased or prolonged market disruption volatility or uncertainty could materially adversely impact our ability to raise capital obtain new financing or refinance our existing obligations as they mature and fund real estate and development activities market volatility could also lead to significant uncertainty in the valuation of our investments and those of our joint ventures which may result in a substantial decrease in the value of our properties and those of our joint ventures as a result we may be unable to recover the carrying amount of such investments and the associated goodwill if any which may require us to recognize impairment charges in earnings 

risks related to other events 

we rely on information technology in our operations and any material failure inadequacy interruption or security failure of that technology could harm our business 

we rely on information technology networks and systems including the internet to process transmit and store electronic information and to manage or support a variety of business processes including financial transactions and records and maintaining personal identifying information and tenant and lease data we purchase some of our information technology from vendors on whom our systems depend we rely on commercially available systems software tools and monitoring to provide security for the processing transmission and storage of confidential tenant and customer data including individually identifiable information relating to financial accounts although we have taken steps to protect the security of our information systems and the data maintained in those systems it is possible that our safety and security measures will not prevent the systems’ improper functioning or damage or the improper access or disclosure of personally identifiable information such as in the event of cyberattacks the risk of security breaches has generally increased as the number intensity and sophistication of attacks and intrusions have increased in addition the pace and unpredictability of cyber threats generally quickly renders longterm implementation plans designed to address cybersecurity risks obsolete because our operators also rely on information technology networks systems and software we may be exposed to cyberattacks on our operators 

security breaches of our or our operators’ networks and systems including those caused by physical or electronic breakins computer viruses malware worms attacks by hackers or foreign governments disruptions from unauthorized access and tampering including through social engineering such as phishing attacks coordinated denialofservice attacks and similar breaches could result in among other things system disruptions shutdowns unauthorized access to or disclosure of confidential information misappropriation of our or our business partners’ proprietary or confidential information breach of our legal regulatory or contractual obligations inability to access or rely upon critical business records or systems or other delays in our operations in some cases it may be difficult to anticipate or immediately detect such incidents and the damage they cause we may be required to expend significant financial resources to protect against or to remediate such security breaches in addition our technology infrastructure and information systems are vulnerable to damage or interruption from natural disasters power loss and telecommunications failures any failure to maintain proper function security and availability of our and our operators’ information systems and the data maintained in those systems could interrupt our operations damage our reputation subject us to liability claims or regulatory penalties harm our business relationships or increase our security and insurance costs which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we are subject to certain provisions of maryland law and our charter relating to business combinations which may prevent a transaction that may otherwise be in the interest of our stockholders 

the maryland business combination act the “mbca” provides that unless exempted a maryland corporation may not engage in business combinations including a merger consolidation share exchange or in circumstances specified in the statute an asset transfer or issuance or reclassification of equity securities with an “interested stockholder” or an affiliate of an interested stockholder for five years after the most recent date on which the interested stockholder became an interested stockholder and thereafter unless specified criteria are met an interested stockholder is generally a person owning or controlling directly or indirectly 10 or more of the voting power of the outstanding voting stock of a maryland corporation unless our board of directors takes action to exempt us generally or with respect to certain transactions from the mbca it will be applicable to business combinations between us and other persons 

in addition to the restrictions on business combinations contained in the mbca our charter also contains restrictions on business combinations our charter requires that except in certain circumstances “business combinations” including a merger or consolidation and certain asset transfers and issuances of securities with a “related person” including a beneficial owner of 10 or more of our outstanding voting stock be approved by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 90 of our outstanding voting stock 

the restrictions on business combinations provided under maryland law and contained in our charter may delay defer or prevent a change of control or other transaction even if such transaction involves a premium price for our common stock or our stockholders believe that such transaction is otherwise in their best interests 

unfavorable resolution of litigation matters and disputes could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition 

from time to time we are involved in legal proceedings lawsuits and other claims we may also be named as defendants in lawsuits arising out of our alleged actions or the alleged actions of our tenants and operators for which such tenants and operators have agreed to indemnify defend and hold us harmless an unfavorable resolution of any such litigation may have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition regardless of the outcome litigation or other legal proceedings may result in substantial costs disruption of our normal business operations and the diversion of management attention we may be unable to prevail in or achieve a favorable settlement of any pending or future legal action against us see item 3legal proceedings of this annual report on form 10k 

the loss or limited availability of our key personnel could disrupt our operations and have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition and the value of our common stock 

we depend on the efforts of our executive officers for the success of our business and competition for these individuals is intense although they are covered by our executive severance plan and change in control plan which provide many of the benefits typically found in executive employment agreements none of our executive officers have employment agreements with us the loss or limited availability of the services of any of our executive officers or our inability to recruit and retain qualified personnel could at least temporarily have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition and the value of our common stock 

environmental compliance costs and liabilities associated with our real estaterelated investments may be substantial and may materially impair the value of those investments 

federal state and local laws ordinances and regulations may require us as a current or previous owner of real estate to investigate and clean up certain hazardous or toxic substances or petroleum released at a property we may be held liable to a governmental entity or to third parties for property damage and for investigation and cleanup costs incurred by the third parties in connection with the contamination the costs of cleanup and remediation could be substantial in addition some environmental laws create a lien on the contaminated site in favor of the government for damages and the costs it incurs in connection with the contamination 

although we currently carry environmental insurance on our properties in an amount that we believe is commercially reasonable and generally require our tenants and operators to indemnify us for environmental liabilities they cause such liabilities could exceed the amount of our insurance the financial ability of the tenant or operator to indemnify us or the value of the contaminated property as the owner of a site we may also be held liable to third parties for damages and injuries resulting from environmental contamination emanating from the site we may also experience environmental liabilities arising from conditions not known to us the cost of defending against these claims complying with environmental regulatory requirements conducting remediation of any contaminated property or paying personal injury or other claims or fines could be substantial and could have a materially adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

in addition the presence of contamination or the failure to remediate contamination may materially adversely affect our ability to use sell or lease the property or to borrow using the property as collateral 

risks related to tax including reitrelated risks 

loss of our tax status as a reit would substantially reduce our available funds and would have materially adverse consequences for us and the value of our common stock 

qualification as a reit involves the application of numerous highly technical and complex provisions of the internal revenue code of 1986 as amended the “code” for which there are limited judicial and administrative interpretations as well as the determination of various factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control we intend to continue to operate in a manner that enables us to qualify as a reit however our qualification and taxation as a reit depend upon our ability to meet through actual annual operating results asset diversification distribution levels and diversity of stock ownership the various qualification tests imposed under the code 

for example to qualify as a reit at least 95 of our gross income in any year must be derived from qualifying sources and we must make distributions to our stockholders aggregating annually to at least 90 of our reit taxable income excluding net capital gains rents we receive from a trs in a ridea structure are treated as qualifying rents from real property for reit tax purposes only if i they are paid pursuant to a lease of a “qualified healthcare property” and ii the operator qualifies as an “eligible independent contractor” as defined in the code if either of these requirements are not satisfied then the rents will not be qualifying rents furthermore new legislation regulations administrative interpretations or court decisions could change the tax laws or interpretations of the tax laws regarding qualification as a reit or the federal income tax consequences of that qualification in a manner that is materially adverse to our stockholders accordingly there is no assurance that we have operated or will continue to operate in a manner so as to qualify or remain qualified as a reit 

if we lose our reit status we will face serious tax consequences that will substantially reduce the funds available to make payments of principal and interest on the debt securities we issue and to make distributions to stockholders if we fail to qualify as a reit 

 as a result of all these factors our failure to qualify as a reit could also impair our ability to expand our business and raise capital and could materially adversely affect the value of our common stock 

further changes to us federal income tax laws could materially and adversely affect us and our stockholders 

the present federal income tax treatment of reits may be modified possibly with retroactive effect by legislative judicial or administrative action at any time which could affect the federal income tax treatment of an investment in us the federal income tax rules dealing with us federal income taxation and reits are constantly under review by persons involved in the legislative process the us internal revenue service the “irs” and the us treasury department which results in statutory changes as well as frequent revisions to regulations and interpretations we cannot predict how changes in the tax laws might affect our investors or us revisions in federal tax laws and interpretations thereof could significantly and negatively affect our ability to qualify as a reit as well as the tax considerations relevant to an investment in us or could cause us to change our investments and commitments 

we could have potential deferred and contingent tax liabilities from corporate acquisitions that could limit delay or impede future sales of our properties 

if during the fiveyear period beginning on the date we acquire certain companies we recognize a gain on the disposition of any property acquired then to the extent of the excess of i the fair market value of such property as of the acquisition date over ii our adjusted income tax basis in such property as of that date we will be required to pay a corporatelevel federal income tax on this gain at the highest regular corporate rate there can be no assurance that these triggering dispositions will not occur and these requirements could limit delay or impede future sales of our properties 

in addition the irs may assert liabilities against us for corporate income taxes for taxable years prior to the time that we acquire certain companies in which case we will owe these taxes plus interest and penalties if any 

there are uncertainties relating to the calculation of nonreit tax earnings and profits “ep” in certain acquisitions which may require us to distribute ep 

in order to remain qualified as a reit we are required to distribute to our stockholders all of the accumulated nonreit ep of certain companies that we acquire prior to the close of the first taxable year in which the acquisition occurs failure to make such ep distributions would result in our disqualification as a reit the determination of the amount to be distributed in such ep distributions is a complex factual and legal determination we may have less than complete information at the time we undertake our analysis or we may interpret the applicable law differently from the irs we currently believe that we have satisfied the requirements relating to such ep distributions there are however substantial uncertainties relating to the determination of ep including the possibility that the irs could successfully assert that the taxable income of the companies acquired should be increased which would increase our nonreit ep moreover an audit of the acquired company following our acquisition could result in an increase in accumulated nonreit ep which could require us to pay an additional taxable distribution to our thenexisting stockholders if we qualify under rules for curing this type of default or could result in our disqualification as a reit 

thus we might fail to satisfy the requirement that we distribute all of our nonreit ep by the close of the first taxable year in which the acquisition occurs moreover although there are procedures available to cure a failure to distribute all of our ep we cannot now determine whether we will be able to take advantage of these procedures or the economic impact on us of doing so 

our charter contains ownership limits with respect to our common stock and other classes of capital stock 

our charter contains restrictions on the ownership and transfer of our common stock and preferred stock that are intended to assist us in preserving our qualification as a reit under our charter subject to certain exceptions no person or entity may own actually or constructively more than 98 by value or by number of shares whichever is more restrictive of the outstanding shares of our common stock or any class or series of our preferred stock 

additionally our charter has a 99 ownership limitation on the direct or indirect ownership of our voting shares which may include common stock or other classes of capital stock our board of directors in its sole discretion may exempt a proposed transferee from either ownership limit the ownership limits may delay defer or prevent a transaction or a change of control that might involve a premium price for our common stock or might otherwise be in the best interests of our stockholders

results of operations 

we evaluate our business and allocate resources among our reportable business segments i senior housing triplenet ii shop iii life science and iv medical office our senior housing facilities are managed utilizing triplenet leases and ridea structures under the life science and medical office segments we invest through the acquisition and development of life science facilities and mobs which generally require a greater level of property management we have other nonreportable segments that are comprised primarily of our debt investments hospital properties and unconsolidated joint ventures we evaluate performance based upon i property net operating income from continuing operations “noi” and ii adjusted noi cash noi in each segment the accounting policies of the segments are the same as those described in the summary of significant accounting policies see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements 

nongaap financial measures 

net operating income 

noi and adjusted noi are nonus generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” supplemental financial measures used to evaluate the operating performance of real estate noi is defined as real estate revenues inclusive of rental and related revenues resident fees and services and income from direct financing leases less property level operating expenses which exclude transition costs noi excludes all other financial statement amounts included in net income loss as presented in note 15 to the consolidated financial statements management believes noi provides relevant and useful information because it reflects only income and operating expense items that are incurred at the property level and presents them on an unlevered basis adjusted noi is calculated as noi after eliminating the effects of straightline rents dfl noncash interest amortization of market lease intangibles termination fees actuarial reserves for insurance claims that have been incurred but not reported and the impact of deferred community fee income and expense adjusted noi is oftentimes referred to as “cash noi” noi and adjusted noi exclude our share of income loss generated by unconsolidated joint ventures which is recognized in equity income loss from unconsolidated joint ventures in the consolidated statements of operations we use noi and adjusted noi to make decisions about resource allocations to assess and compare property level performance and to evaluate our same property portfolio “spp” as described below we believe that net income loss is the most directly comparable gaap measure to noi and adjusted noi noi and adjusted noi should not be viewed as alternative measures of operating performance to net income loss as defined by gaap since they do not reflect various excluded items further our definitions of noi and adjusted noi may not be comparable to the definitions used by other reits or real estate companies as they may use different methodologies for calculating noi and adjusted noi for a reconciliation of noi and adjusted noi to net income loss by segment refer to note 15 to the consolidated financial statements 

operating expenses generally relate to leased medical office and life science properties and shop facilities we generally recover all or a portion of our leased medical office and life science property expenses through tenant recoveries we present expenses as operating or general and administrative based on the underlying nature of the expense 

same property portfolio 

spp noi and adjusted cash noi information allows us to evaluate the performance of our property portfolio under a consistent population by eliminating changes in the composition of our consolidated portfolio of properties spp noi excludes certain nonproperty specific operating expenses that are allocated to each operating segment on a consolidated basis 

properties are included in spp once they are stabilized for the full period in both comparison periods newly acquired operating assets are generally considered stabilized at the earlier of leaseup typically when the tenants controls the physical use of at least 80 of the space or 12 months from the acquisition date newly completed developments and redevelopments are considered stabilized at the earlier of leaseup or 24 months from the date the property is placed in service properties that experience a change in reporting structure such as a transition from a triplenet lease to a ridea reporting structure are considered stabilized after 12 months in operations under a consistent reporting structure a property is removed from spp when it is classified as held for sale sold placed into redevelopment experiences a casualty event that significantly impacts operations or a change in reporting structure has been agreed to such as triplenet to shop

ffo encompasses nareit ffo and ffo as adjusted each of which is described in detail below we believe ffo applicable to common shares diluted ffo applicable to common shares and diluted ffo per common share are important supplemental nongaap measures of operating performance for a reit because the historical cost accounting convention used for real estate assets utilizes straightline depreciation except on land such accounting presentation implies that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time since real estate values instead have historically risen and fallen with market conditions presentations of operating results for a reit that use historical cost accounting for depreciation could be less informative the term ffo was designed by the reit industry to address this issue 

nareit ffo  ffo as defined by the national association of real estate investment trusts “nareit” is net income loss applicable to common shares computed in accordance with gaap excluding gains or losses from sales of depreciable property including any current and deferred taxes directly associated with sales of depreciable property impairments of or related to depreciable real estate plus real estate and other real estaterelated depreciation and amortization and adjustments to compute our share of nareit ffo and ffo as adjusted see below from joint ventures adjustments for joint ventures are calculated to reflect our prorata share of both our consolidated and unconsolidated joint ventures we reflect our share of nareit ffo for unconsolidated joint ventures by applying our actual ownership percentage for the period to the applicable reconciling items on an entity by entity basis for consolidated joint ventures in which we do not own 100 we reflect our share of the equity by adjusting our nareit ffo to remove the third party ownership share of the applicable reconciling items based on actual ownership percentage for the applicable periods our prorata share information is prepared on a basis consistent with the comparable consolidated amounts is intended to reflect our proportionate economic interest in the operating results of properties in our portfolio and is calculated by applying our actual ownership percentage for the period we do not control the unconsolidated joint ventures and the prorata presentations of reconciling items included in nareit ffo do not represent our legal claim to such items the joint venture members or partners are entitled to profit or loss allocations and distributions of cash flows according to the joint venture agreements which provide for such allocations generally according to their invested capital 

the presentation of prorata information has limitations which include but are not limited to the following i the amounts shown on the individual line items were derived by applying our overall economic ownership interest percentage determined when applying the equity method of accounting and do not necessarily represent our legal claim to the assets and liabilities or the revenues and expenses and ii other companies in our industry may calculate their prorata interest differently limiting the usefulness as a comparative measure because of these limitations the prorata financial information should not be considered independently or as a substitute for our financial statements as reported under gaap we compensate for these limitations by relying primarily on our gaap financial statements using the prorata financial information as a supplement 

nareit ffo does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with gaap is not necessarily indicative of cash available to fund cash needs and should not be considered an alternative to net income loss we compute nareit ffo in accordance with the current nareit definition however other reits may report nareit ffo differently or have a different interpretation of the current nareit definition from ours 

ffo as adjusted  in addition we present nareit ffo on an adjusted basis before the impact of noncomparable items including but not limited to transactionrelated items impairments recoveries of nondepreciable assets losses gains from the sale of nondepreciable assets severance and related charges prepayment costs benefits associated with early retirement or payment of debt litigation costs recoveries casualtyrelated charges recoveries foreign currency remeasurement losses gains and changes in tax legislation “ffo as adjusted” transactionrelated items include transaction expenses and gainscharges incurred as a result of mergers and acquisitions and lease amendment or termination activities prepayment costs benefits associated with early retirement of debt include the writeoff of unamortized deferred financing fees or additional costs expenses discounts makewhole payments penalties or premiums incurred as a result of early retirement or payment of debt management believes that ffo as adjusted provides a meaningful supplemental measurement of our ffo runrate and is frequently used by analysts investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of our performance as a reit at the same time that nareit created and defined its ffo measure for the reit industry it also recognized that “management of each of its member companies has the responsibility and authority to publish financial information that it regards as useful to the financial community” we believe stockholders potential investors and financial analysts who review our operating performance are best served by an ffo runrate earnings measure that includes certain other adjustments to net income loss in addition to adjustments made to arrive at the nareit defined measure of ffo ffo as adjusted is used by management in analyzing our business and the performance of our properties and we believe it is important that stockholders potential investors and financial analysts understand this measure used by management we use ffo as adjusted to i evaluate our performance in comparison with expected results and results of previous periods relative to resource allocation decisions ii evaluate the performance of our management iii budget and forecast future results to assist in the allocation of resources iv assess our performance as compared with similar real estate companies and the industry in general and v evaluate how a specific potential investment will impact our future results other reits or real estate companies may use different methodologies for calculating an adjusted ffo measure and accordingly our ffo as adjusted may not be comparable to those reported by other reits for a reconciliation of net income loss to nareit ffo and ffo as adjusted and other relevant disclosure refer to “nongaap financial measures reconciliations” below 

funds available for distribution fad 

fad is defined as ffo as adjusted after excluding the impact of the following i amortization of deferred compensation expense ii amortization of deferred financing costs net iii straightline rents iv deferred income taxes v amortization of acquired market lease intangibles net vi noncash interest related to dfls and lease incentive amortization reduction of straightline rents vii actuarial reserves for insurance claims that have been incurred but not reported and viii deferred revenues excluding amounts amortized into rental income that are associated with tenant funded improvements ownedrecognized by us and upfront cash payments made by tenants to reduce their contractual rents also fad i is computed after deducting recurring capital expenditures including second generation leasing costs and second generation tenant and capital improvements and ii includes lease restructure payments and adjustments to compute our share of fad from our unconsolidated joint ventures and those related to ccrc nonrefundable entrance fees certain prior period amounts in the “nongaap financial measures reconciliation” below for fad have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation more specifically recurring capital expenditures including second generation leasing costs and second generation tenant and capital improvements fad capital expenditures excludes our share from unconsolidated joint ventures reported in “other fad adjustments” adjustments for joint ventures are calculated to reflect our prorata share of both our consolidated and unconsolidated joint ventures we reflect our share of fad for unconsolidated joint ventures by applying our actual ownership percentage for the period to the applicable reconciling items on an entity by entity basis we reflect our share for consolidated joint ventures in which we do not own 100 of the equity by adjusting our fad to remove the third party ownership share of the applicable reconciling items based on actual ownership percentage for the applicable periods reported in “other fad adjustments” see ffo for further disclosure regarding our use of prorata share information and its limitations other reits or real estate companies may use different methodologies for calculating fad and accordingly our fad may not be comparable to those reported by other reits although our fad computation may not be comparable to that of other reits management believes fad provides a meaningful supplemental measure of our performance and is frequently used by analysts investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of our performance as a reit we believe fad is an alternative runrate earnings measure that improves the understanding of our operating results among investors and makes comparisons with i expected results ii results of previous periods and iii results among reits more meaningful fad does not represent cash generated from operating activities determined in accordance with gaap and is not necessarily indicative of cash available to fund cash needs as it excludes the following items which generally flow through our cash flows from operating activities i adjustments for changes in working capital or the actual timing of the payment of income or expense items that are accrued in the period ii transactionrelated costs iii litigation settlement expenses iv severancerelated expenses and v actual cash receipts from interest income recognized on loans receivable in contrast to our fad adjustment to exclude noncash interest and depreciation related to our investments in direct financing leases furthermore fad is adjusted for recurring capital expenditures which are generally not considered when determining cash flows from operations or liquidity fad is a nongaap supplemental financial measure and should not be considered as an alternative to net income loss determined in accordance with gaap for a reconciliation of net income loss to fad and other relevant disclosure refer to “nongaap financial measures reconciliations” below

we own interests in certain unconsolidated joint ventures as described in note 8 to the consolidated financial statements except in limited circumstances our risk of loss is limited to our investment in the joint venture and any outstanding loans receivable in addition we have certain properties which serve as collateral for debt that is owed by a previous owner of certain of our facilities as described under note 11 to the consolidated financial statements our risk of loss for these certain properties is limited to the outstanding debt balance plus penalties if any we have no other material offbalance sheet arrangements that we expect would materially affect our liquidity and capital resources except those described above under “contractual obligations” 

inflation 

our leases often provide for either fixed increases in base rents or indexed escalators based on the consumer price index or other measures andor additional rent based on increases in the tenants’ operating revenues most of our mob leases require the tenant to pay a share of property operating costs such as real estate taxes insurance and utilities substantially all of our senior housing triplenet life science and remaining other leases require the tenant or operator to pay all of the property operating costs or reimburse us for all such costs we believe that inflationary increases in expenses will be offset in part by the tenant or operator expense reimbursements and contractual rent increases described above

critical accounting policies 

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us gaap requires our management to use judgment in the application of accounting policies including making estimates and assumptions we base estimates on the best information available to us at the time our experience and on various other assumptions believed to be reasonable under the circumstances these estimates affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods if our judgment or interpretation of the facts and circumstances relating to various transactions or other matters had been different it is possible that different accounting would have been applied resulting in a different presentation of our consolidated financial statements from time to time we reevaluate our estimates and assumptions in the event estimates or assumptions prove to be different from actual results adjustments are made in subsequent periods to reflect more current estimates and assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain for a more detailed discussion of our significant accounting policies see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements below is a discussion of accounting policies that we consider critical in that they may require complex judgment in their application or require estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain 

principles of consolidation 

the consolidated financial statements include the accounts of healthpeak properties inc our whollyowned subsidiaries and joint ventures that we control through voting rights or other means we consolidate investments in variable interest entities “vies” when we are the primary beneficiary of the vie a variable interest holder is considered to be the primary beneficiary of a vie if it has the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the entity’s economic performance and has the obligation to absorb losses of or the right to receive benefits from the entity that could potentially be significant to the vie 

we make judgments about which entities are vies based on an assessment of whether i the equity investment at risk is insufficient to finance that entity’s activities without additional subordinated financial support ii substantially all of an entity’s activities either involve or are conducted on behalf of an investor that has disproportionately few voting rights or iii the equity investors as a group lack any of the following a the power through voting or similar rights to direct the activities of an entity that most significantly impact the entity’s economic performance b the obligation to absorb the expected losses of an entity or c the right to receive the expected residual returns of an entity criterion iii above is generally applied to limited partnerships and similarly structured entities by assessing whether a simple majority of the limited partners hold substantive rights to participate in the significant decisions of the entity or have the ability to remove the decision maker or liquidate the entity without cause if neither of those criteria are met the entity is a vie 

we continually assess whether events have occurred that require us to reconsider the initial determination of whether an entity is a vie such events include but are not limited to i a change to the contractual arrangements of the entity or in the ability of a party to exercise its participation or kickout rights ii a change to the capitalization structure of the entity or iii acquisitions or sales of interests that constitute a change in control when a reconsideration event occurs we reassess whether the entity is a vie 

we also make judgments with respect to our level of influence or control over an entity and whether we are or are not the primary beneficiary of a vie consideration of various factors includes but is not limited to 

 • our form of ownership interest 

• our representation on the entity’s governing body 

• the size and seniority of our investment 

• our ability to manage our ownership interest relative to other interest holders and 

 our ability to correctly assess our influence or control over an entity when determining the primary beneficiary of a vie affects the presentation of these entities in our consolidated financial statements when we perform a reassessment of the primary beneficiary at a date other than at inception of the vie our assumptions may be different and may result in the identification of a different primary beneficiary 

if we determine that we are the primary beneficiary of a vie our consolidated financial statements include the operating results of the vie rather than the results of our variable interest in the vie we require vies to provide us timely financial information and review the internal controls of vies to determine if we can rely on the financial information it provides if a vie has deficiencies in its internal controls over financial reporting or does not provide us with timely financial information it may adversely impact the quality andor timing of our financial reporting and our internal controls over financial reporting 

revenue recognition 

lease classification 

at the inception of a new lease arrangement including new leases that arise from amendments we assess the terms and conditions to determine the proper lease classification for leases entered into prior to january 1 2019 a lease arrangement is classified as an operating lease if none of the following criteria are met i transfer of ownership to the lessee prior to or shortly after the end of the lease term ii the lessee has a bargain purchase option during or at the end of the lease term iii the lease term is equal to 75 or more of the underlying property’s economic life or iv the present value of future minimum lease payments excluding executory costs is equal to 90 or more of the estimated fair value of the leased asset if one of the four criteria is met and the minimum lease payments are determined to be reasonably predictable and collectible the lease arrangement is generally accounted for as a dfl 

concurrent with our adoption of accounting standards update asu no 201602 leases “asu 201602” on january 1 2019 we began classifying a lease entered into subsequent to adoption as an operating lease if none of the following criteria are met i transfer of ownership to the lessee by the end of the lease term ii lessee has a purchase option during or at the end of the lease term that it is reasonably certain to exercise iii the lease term is for the major part of the remaining economic life of the underlying asset iv the present value of future minimum lease payments is equal to substantially all of the fair value of the underlying asset or v the underlying asset is of such a specialized nature that it is expected to have no alternative use to us at the end of the lease term 

if the assumptions utilized in the above classification assessments were different our lease classification for accounting purposes may have been different thus the timing and amount of our revenue recognized would have been impacted which may be material to our consolidated financial statements 

rental and related revenues 

we recognize rental revenue for operating leases on a straightline basis over the lease term when collectibility of all minimum lease payments is probable and the tenant has taken possession or controls the physical use of a leased asset if the lease provides for tenant improvements we determine whether the tenant improvements are owned by the tenant or us when we are the owner of the tenant improvements the tenant is not considered to have taken physical possession or have control of the leased asset until the tenant improvements are substantially complete when the tenant is the owner of the tenant improvements any tenant improvement allowance funded is treated as a lease incentive and amortized as a reduction of revenue over the lease term the determination of ownership of a tenant improvement is subject to significant judgment if our assessment of the owner of the tenant improvements was different the timing and amount of our revenue recognized would be impacted 

certain leases provide for additional rents that are contingent upon a percentage of the facility’s revenue in excess of specified base amounts or other thresholds such revenue is recognized when actual results reported by the tenant or estimates of tenant results exceed the base amount or other thresholds the recognition of additional rents requires us to make estimates of amounts owed and to a certain extent is dependent on the accuracy of the facility results reported to us our estimates may differ from actual results which could be material to our consolidated financial statements 

resident fees and services 

resident fee revenue is recorded when services are rendered and includes resident room and care charges community fees and other resident charges residency agreements are generally for a term of 30 days to one year with resident fees billed monthly in advance revenue for certain care related services is recognized as services are provided and is billed monthly in arrears 

certain of our ccrcs are operated as entrance fee communities which typically require a resident to pay an upfront entrance fee that includes both a refundable portion and nonrefundable portion when we receive a nonrefundable entrance fee it is recognized as deferred revenue and amortized into revenue over the estimated stay of the resident 

credit losses 

we continuously assess the collectibility of operating lease straightline rent receivables if it is no longer probable that substantially all future minimum lease payments will be received the straightline rent receivable balance is written off and recognized as a decrease in revenue in that period we monitor the liquidity and creditworthiness of our tenants and operators on a continuous basis this evaluation considers industry and economic conditions property performance credit enhancements and other factors we exercise judgment in this assessment and consider payment history and current credit status in developing these estimates these estimates may differ from actual results which could be material to our consolidated financial statements 

loans receivable and dfls collectively “finance receivables” are reviewed and assigned an internal rating of performing watch list or workout finance receivables that are deemed performing meet all present contractual obligations and collection and timing of all amounts owed is reasonably assured watch list finance receivables are defined as finance receivables that do not meet the definition of performing or workout workout finance receivables are defined as finance receivables in which we have determined based on current information and events that i it is probable we will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the agreement ii the tenant operator or borrower is delinquent on making payments under the contractual terms of the agreement and iii we have commenced action or anticipate pursuing action in the near term to seek recovery of our investment 

finance receivables are placed on nonaccrual status when management determines that the collectibility of contractual amounts is not reasonably assured the asset will have an internal rating of either watch list or workout further we perform a credit analysis to support the tenant’s operator’s borrower’s andor guarantor’s repayment capacity and the underlying collateral values we use the cash basis method of accounting for finance receivables placed on nonaccrual status unless one of the following conditions exist whereby we utilize the cost recovery method of accounting i if we determine that it is probable that we will only recover the recorded investment in the finance receivable net of associated allowances or chargeoffs if any or ii we cannot reasonably estimate the amount of an impaired finance receivable for cash basis method of accounting we apply payments received excluding principal paydowns to interest income so long as that amount does not exceed the amount that would have been earned under the original contractual terms for cost recovery method of accounting any payment received is applied to reduce the recorded investment generally we return a finance receivable to accrual status when all delinquent payments become current under the terms of the loan or lease agreements and collectibility of the remaining contractual loan or lease payments is reasonably assured 

prior to the adoption of asu no 201613 measurement of credit losses on financial instruments “asu 201613” on january 1 2020 allowances were established for finance receivables on an individual basis utilizing an estimate of probable losses if they were determined to be impaired finance receivables are impaired when it is was deemed probable that we would be unable to collect all amounts due in accordance with the contractual terms of the loan or lease an allowance was based upon our assessment of the lessee’s or borrower’s overall financial condition economic resources payment record the prospects for support from any financially responsible guarantors and if appropriate the net realizable value of any collateral these estimates considered all available evidence including the expected future cash flows discounted at the finance receivable’s effective interest rate fair value of collateral general economic conditions and trends historical and industry loss experience and other relevant factors as appropriate if a finance receivable was deemed partially or wholly uncollectible the uncollectible balance was charged off against the allowance in the period in which the uncollectible determination has been made 

subsequent to adopting asu 201613 on january 1 2020 we began using a loss model that relies on future expected credit losses rather than incurred losses as was required under historical us gaap under the new model we are required to recognize future credit losses expected to be incurred over the life of a financing receivable at inception of that instrument the model emphasized historical experience and future market expectations to determine a loss to be recognized at inception however the model continues to be applied on an individual basis and rely on counterparty specific information to ensure the most accurate estimate is recognized 

real estate 

we make estimates as part of our process for allocating a purchase price to the various identifiable assets and liabilities of an acquisition based upon the relative fair value of each asset or liability the most significant components of our allocations are typically buildings asifvacant land and inplace leases in the case of allocating fair value to buildings and intangibles our fair value estimates will affect the amount of depreciation and amortization we record over the estimated useful life of each asset acquired in the case of allocating fair value to inplace leases we make our best estimates based on our evaluation of the specific characteristics of each tenant’s lease factors considered include estimates of carrying costs during hypothetical expected leaseup periods market conditions and costs to execute similar leases our assumptions affect the amount of future revenue andor depreciation and amortization expense that we will recognize over the remaining useful life for the acquired inplace leases 

certain of our acquisitions involve the assumption of contract liabilities we typically estimate the fair value of contract liabilities by applying a reasonable profit margin to the total discounted estimated future costs associated with servicing the contract we consider a variety of market and contractspecific conditions when making assumptions that impact the estimated fair value of the contract liability 

a variety of costs are incurred in the development and leasing of properties after determination is made to capitalize a cost it is allocated to the specific component of a project that is benefited determination of when a development project is substantially complete and capitalization must cease involves a degree of judgment the costs of land and buildings under development include specifically identifiable costs the capitalized costs include preconstruction costs essential to the development of the property development costs construction costs interest costs real estate taxes and other costs incurred during the period of development we consider a construction project to be considered substantially complete and available for occupancy and cease capitalization of costs upon the completion of the related tenant improvements 

assets held for sale 

the company classifies a real estate property as held for sale when i management has approved the disposal ii the property is available for sale in its present condition iii an active program to locate a buyer has been initiated iv it is probable that the property will be disposed of within one year v the property is being marketed at a reasonable price relative to its fair value and vi it is unlikely that the disposal plan will significantly change or be withdrawn if an asset is classified as held for sale it is reported at the lower of its carrying value or fair value less costs to sell and no longer depreciated 

impairment of longlived assets 

we assess the carrying value of our real estate assets and related intangibles “real estate assets” when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable recoverability of real estate assets is measured by comparing the carrying amount of the real estate assets to the respective estimated future undiscounted cash flows the expected future undiscounted cash flows reflect external market factors and are probabilityweighted to reflect multiple possible cashflow scenarios including selling the assets at various points in the future additionally the estimated future undiscounted cash flows are calculated utilizing the lowest level of identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities in order to review our real estate assets for recoverability we make assumptions regarding external market conditions including capitalization rates and growth rates forecasted cash flows and sales prices and our intent with respect to holding or disposing of the asset if our analysis indicates that the carrying value of the real estate assets is not recoverable on an undiscounted cash flow basis we recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the real estate asset 

determining the fair value of real estate assets including assets classified as heldforsale involves significant judgment and generally utilizes market capitalization rates comparable market transactions estimated perunit or per square foot prices negotiations with prospective buyers and forecasted cash flows lease revenue rates expense rates growth rates etc our ability to accurately predict future operating results and resulting cash flows and estimate fair values impacts the timing and recognition of impairments while we believe our assumptions are reasonable changes in these assumptions may have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 

investments in unconsolidated joint ventures 

the initial carrying value of investments in unconsolidated joint ventures is based on the amount paid to purchase the joint venture interest or the carrying value of the assets prior to the sale or contribution of the interests to the joint venture we evaluate our equity method investments for impairment by first reviewing for indicators of impairment based on the performance of the underlying real estate assets held by the joint venture if an equitymethod investment shows indicators of impairment we compare the fair value of the investment to the carrying value if we determine there is a decline in the fair value of our investment in an unconsolidated joint venture below its carrying value and it is otherthantemporary an impairment charge is recorded the determination of the fair value of investments in unconsolidated joint ventures and as to whether a deficiency in fair value is otherthantemporary involves significant judgment our estimates consider all available evidence including as appropriate the present value of the expected future cash flows discounted at market rates general economic conditions and trends severity and duration of a fair value deficiency and other relevant factors capitalization rates discount rates and credit spreads utilized in our valuation models are based on rates we believe to be within a reasonable range of current market rates for the respective investments while we believe our assumptions are reasonable changes in these assumptions may have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 

income taxes 

as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements significant management judgment is required to evaluate our compliance with reit requirements our determinations are based on interpretation of tax laws and our conclusions may have an impact on the income tax expense recognized adjustments to income tax expense may be required as a result of i audits conducted by federal state and local tax authorities ii our ability to qualify as a reit iii the potential for builtin gain recognition and iv changes in tax laws adjustments required in any given period are included within the income tax provision

 item 7a 

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

tableend we are exposed to various market risks including the potential loss arising from adverse changes in interest rates we use derivative and other financial instruments in the normal course of business to mitigate interest rate we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes derivatives are recorded on the consolidated balance sheets at fair value see note 21 to the consolidated financial statements 

to illustrate the effect of movements in the interest rate markets we performed a market sensitivity analysis on our hedging instruments we applied various basis point spreads to the underlying interest rate curves of the derivative portfolio in order to determine the change in fair value assuming a one percentage point change in the underlying interest rate curve the estimated change in fair value of each of the underlying derivative instruments would not be material 

interest rate risk 

at december 31 2019  our exposure to interest rate risk is primarily on our variable rate debt at december 31 2019  42 million of our variablerate debt was hedged by interest rate swap transactions the interest rate swaps are designated as cash flow hedges with the objective of managing the exposure to interest rate risk by converting the interest rates on our variablerate debt to fixed interest rates 

interest rate fluctuations will generally not affect our future earnings or cash flows on our fixed rate debt and assets until their maturity or earlier prepayment and refinancing if interest rates have risen at the time we seek to refinance our fixed rate debt whether at maturity or otherwise our future earnings and cash flows could be adversely affected by additional borrowing costs conversely lower interest rates at the time of refinancing may reduce our overall borrowing costs however interest rate changes will affect the fair value of our fixed rate instruments at december 31 2019  a one percentage point increase or decrease in interest rates would change the fair value of our fixed rate debt by approximately 365 million and 401 million  respectively and would not materially impact earnings or cash flows additionally a one percentage point increase or decrease in interest rates would change the fair value of our fixed rate debt investments by approximately 2 million and less than 7 million  respectively and would not materially impact earnings or cash flows conversely changes in interest rates on variable rate debt and investments would change our future earnings and cash flows but not materially impact the fair value of those instruments assuming a one percentage point change in the interest rate related to our variablerate debt and variablerate investments and assuming no other changes in the outstanding balance at december 31 2019  our annual interest expense and interest income would increase by approximately 3 million and 1 million  respectively 

market risk 

we have investments in marketable debt securities classified as heldtomaturity because we have the positive intent and ability to hold the securities to maturity heldtomaturity securities are recorded at amortized cost and adjusted for the amortization of premiums and discounts through maturity we consider a variety of factors in evaluating an otherthantemporary decline in value such as the length of time and the extent to which the market value has been less than our current adjusted carrying value the issuer’s financial condition capital strength and nearterm prospects any recent events specific to that issuer and economic conditions of its industry and our investment horizon in relationship to an anticipated nearterm recovery in the market value if any at december 31 2019  both the fair value and carrying value of marketable debt securities was 20 million

business 

tableend general overview 

hcp an sp 500 company invests primarily in real estate serving the healthcare industry in the united states “us” we are a maryland corporation organized in 1985 and qualify as a selfadministered real estate investment trust we are headquartered in irvine california with offices in nashville and san francisco our diverse portfolio is comprised of investments in the following reportable healthcare segments i senior housing triplenet ii senior housing operating portfolio “shop” iii life science and iv medical office at december 31 2018  we had 201  fulltime employees 

for a description of our significant activities during 2018  see “item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations—2018 transaction overview” in this report 

business strategy 

we invest and manage our real estate portfolio for the longterm to maximize the benefit to our stockholders and support the growth of our dividends the core elements of our strategy are to 

 internal growth strategies 

we believe our real estate portfolio holds the potential for increased future cash flows as it is wellmaintained and in desirable locations our strategy for maximizing the benefits from these opportunities is to i work with new or existing tenants and operators to address their space and capital needs and ii provide highquality property management services in order to motivate tenants to renew expand or relocate into our properties 

we expect to continue our internal growth as a result of our ability to 

 investment strategies 

the delivery of healthcare services requires real estate and as a result tenants and operators depend on real estate in part to maintain and grow their businesses we believe that the healthcare real estate market provides investment opportunities due to the i compelling longterm demographics driving the demand for healthcare services ii specialized nature of healthcare real estate investing and iii ongoing consolidation of the fragmented healthcare real estate sector 

while we emphasize healthcare real estate ownership we may also provide real estate secured financing to or invest in equity or debt securities of healthcare operators or other entities engaged in healthcare real estate ownership we may also acquire all or substantially all of the securities or assets of other reits operating companies or similar entities where such investments would be consistent with our investment strategies we may coinvest alongside institutional or development investors through partnerships or limited liability companies 

we monitor but do not limit our investments based on the percentage of our total assets that may be invested in any one property type investment vehicle or geographic location the number of properties that may be leased to a single tenant or operator or loans that may be made to a single borrower in allocating capital we target opportunities with the most attractive riskreward profile for our portfolio as a whole we may take additional measures to mitigate risk including diversifying our investments by sector geography tenant or operator structuring transactions as master leases requiring tenant or operator insurance and indemnifications and obtaining credit enhancements in the form of guarantees letters of credit or security deposits 

we believe we are wellpositioned to achieve external growth through acquisitions financing and development other factors that contribute to our competitive position include 

 financing strategies 

our reit qualification requires us to distribute at least 90 of our reit taxable income excluding net capital gains therefore we do not retain a significant amount of capital as a result we regularly access the public equity and debt markets to raise the funds necessary to finance acquisitions and debt investments develop and redevelop properties and refinance maturing debt 

we may finance acquisitions and other investments through the following vehicles 

 we maintain a disciplined balance sheet by actively managing our debt to equity levels and maintaining multiple sources of liquidity our debt obligations are primarily longterm fixed rate with staggered maturities 

we finance our investments based on our evaluation of available sources of funding for shortterm purposes we may utilize our revolving line of credit facility arrange for other shortterm borrowings from banks or other sources or issue equity securities pursuant to our atthemarket equity offering program we arrange for longerterm financing by offering debt and equity securities placing mortgage debt and obtaining capital from institutional lenders and joint venture partners 

segments 

senior housing triplenet and senior housing operating portfolio or shop 

our senior housing properties are owned either through triplenet leases with third party tenantoperators or through socalled ridea structures which is permitted by the housing and economic recovery act of 2008 and includes most of the provisions previously proposed in the reit investment diversification and empowerment act of 2007 commonly referred to as “ridea” 

our senior housing properties include independent living facilities “ilfs” assisted living facilities “alfs” memory care facilities “mcfs” and continuing care retirement communities “ccrcs” which cater to different segments of the elderly population based upon their personal needs the services provided by our third party tenantoperators under triplenet leases or by our thirdparty manageroperators under a ridea structure at our properties are primarily paid for by the residents directly or through private insurance and are less reliant on government reimbursement programs such as medicare and medicaid 

our triplenet leases are typically longterm agreements with third party tenantoperators under triplenet leases our tenantoperators are typically responsible for the ongoing expenses of the property including real estate taxes insurance and maintenance in addition to paying the rent and utilities additionally operational risks and liabilities are the responsibility of our tenantoperator including with respect to any employment matters compliance with healthcare and other laws and liabilities relating to personal injurytort matters residentpatient quality of care claims and governmental reimbursement matters 

a ridea structure allows us through a taxable reit subsidiary “trs” to receive cash flow from the operations of a healthcare facility as compared to only receiving contractual rent from a thirdparty tenantoperator under a triplenet lease structure in compliance with reit tax requirements the criteria for operating a healthcare facility through a ridea structure require us to lease the facility to an affiliate trs under a triplenet lease and for such affiliate trs to engage an independent qualifying management company also known as an eligible independent contractor or thirdparty operator to manage and operate the daytoday business of the facility in exchange for a management fee as a result under a ridea structure we are required to rely on a thirdparty operator to hire and train all facility employees enter into all thirdparty contracts for the benefit of the facility including residentpatient agreements comply with laws including but not limited to healthcare laws and provide resident care we are substantially limited in our ability to control or influence daytoday operations under a ridea structure and thus rely on the thirdparty tenantoperator to manage and operate the business 

unlike our triplenet leased properties through our trs we bear all operational risks and liabilities associated with the operation of these properties with limited exceptions such as a thirdparty operator’s gross negligence or willful misconduct these operational risks and liabilities include those relating to any employment matters of our operator compliance with healthcare and other laws and liabilities relating to personal injurytort matters residentpatient quality of care claims and any governmental reimbursement matters even though we have limited ability to control or influence our thirdparty operators’ management of these risks 

we view ridea as an important structure for senior housing properties that present attractive valuation entry points andor growth profiles and this structure has become the preferred structure as opposed to triplenet leases among most highquality operators in the senior housing industry many of the management agreements we have in ridea structured transactions have terms ranging from 5 to 15 years with mutual renewal options the base management fees are typically 45 to 50 of gross revenues as defined generated by the ridea properties in addition there are sometimes incentive management fees payable to our thirdparty operators if operating results of the ridea properties exceed preestablished thresholds conversely there are sometimes provisions in the management agreements that reduce management fees payable to our thirdparty operators if operating results do not meet certain preestablished thresholds 

our senior housing property types under both triplenet leases and ridea structures are further described below 



of the resident’s lifetime which offer a continuum of housing services and healthcare on one campus or site ccrcs are appealing as they allow residents to “age in place” ccrcs typically require the individual to be in relatively good health and independent upon entry 

the following table provides information about our senior housing triplenet tenant concentration for the year ended december 31 2018  



 

 as of december 31 2018  brookdale operated in our shop segment approximately 7  of our real estate investments based on total assets because thirdparty operators manage our ridea properties in exchange for the receipt of a management fee we are not directly exposed to the credit risk of these operators in the same manner or to the same extent as our triplenet tenants 

life science 

these properties contain laboratory and office space primarily for biotechnology medical device and pharmaceutical companies scientific research institutions government agencies and other organizations involved in the life science industry while these properties have characteristics similar to commercial office buildings they generally contain more advanced electrical mechanical and heating ventilating and air conditioning systems the facilities generally have specialty equipment including emergency generators fume hoods lab bench tops and related amenities in many instances life science tenants make significant investments to improve their leased space in addition to landlord improvements to accommodate biology chemistry or medical device research initiatives 

life science properties are primarily configured in business park or campus settings and include multiple buildings the business park and campus settings allow us the opportunity to provide flexible contiguousadjacent expansion to accommodate the growth of existing tenants our properties are located in wellestablished geographical markets known for scientific research and drug discovery including san francisco 56 and san diego 31 california boston massachusetts and durham north carolina based on square feet at december 31 2018  91  of our life science properties were triplenet leased based on leased square feet 

the following table provides information about our life science tenant concentration for the year ended december 31 2018  



medical office 

medical office buildings “mobs” typically contain physicians’ offices and examination rooms and may also include pharmacies hospital ancillary service space and outpatient services such as diagnostic centers rehabilitation clinics and daysurgery operating rooms while these facilities are similar to commercial office buildings they require additional plumbing electrical and mechanical systems to accommodate multiple exam rooms that may require sinks in every room and special equipment such as xray machines in addition mobs are often built to accommodate higher structural loads for certain equipment and may contain vaults or other specialized construction our mobs are typically multitenant properties leased to healthcare providers hospitals and physician practices with approximately 82  of our mobs located on hospital campuses and 94  affiliated with hospital systems based on square feet occasionally we invest in mobs located on hospital campuses which may be subject to ground leases at december 31 2018  approximately 55  of our mobs were net leased based on leased square feet with the remaining leased under gross or modified gross leases 

the following table provides information about our medical office tenant concentration for the year ended december 31 2018  



 

 other nonreportable segments   at december 31 2018  we had interests in 14  hospitals one  postacuteskilled nursing facility “snf” and debt investments additionally we had interests in 25 senior housing facilities 68  care homes in the united kingdom “uk” three mobs and three snfs owned and operated by our unconsolidated joint ventures services provided by our tenants and operators in hospitals are paid for by private sources thirdparty payors eg insurance and hmos or through medicare and medicaid programs our hospital property types include acute care longterm acute care and specialty and rehabilitation hospitals care homes offer personal care services such as lodging meal services housekeeping and laundry services medication management and assistance with adl care homes are registered to provide different levels of services ranging from personal care to nursing care some homes can be further registered for a specific care need such as dementia or terminal illness snfs offer restorative rehabilitative and custodial nursing care for people following a hospital stay or not requiring the more extensive and complex treatment available at hospitals all of our care homes in the uk hospitals and snfs are triplenet leased 

competition 

investing in real estate serving the healthcare industry is highly competitive we face competition from other reits investment companies pension funds private equity investors sovereign funds healthcare operators lenders developers and other institutional investors some of whom may have greater flexibility eg nonreit competitors resources and lower costs of capital than we do increased competition makes it more challenging for us to identify and successfully capitalize on opportunities that meet our objectives our ability to compete may also be impacted by global national and local economic trends availability of investment alternatives availability and cost of capital construction and renovation costs existing laws and regulations new legislation and population trends 

income from our investments depends on our tenants’ and operators’ ability to compete with other companies on multiple levels including the quality of care provided reputation success of product or drug development the physical appearance of a facility price and range of services offered alternatives for healthcare delivery the supply of competing properties physicians staff referral sources location the size and demographics of the population in surrounding areas and the financial condition of our tenants and operators for a discussion of the risks associated with competitive conditions affecting our business see “item 1a risk factors” in this report 

government regulation licensing and enforcement 

overview 

our healthcare facility operators which include our trss when we use a ridea structure and tenants are typically subject to extensive and complex federal state and local healthcare laws and regulations relating to quality of care licensure and certificate of need government reimbursement fraud and abuse practices and similar laws governing the operation of healthcare facilities and we expect that the healthcare industry in general will continue to face increased regulation and pressure in the areas of fraud waste and abuse cost control healthcare management and provision of services among others these regulations are wide ranging and can subject our tenants and operators to civil criminal and administrative sanctions affected tenants and operators may find it increasingly difficult to comply with this complex and evolving regulatory environment because of a relative lack of guidance in many areas as certain of our healthcare properties are subject to oversight from several government agencies and the laws may vary from one jurisdiction to another changes in laws regulations reimbursement enforcement activity and regulatory noncompliance by our tenants and operators can all have a significant effect on their operations and financial condition which in turn may adversely impact us as detailed below and set forth under “item 1a risk factors” in this report 

the following is a discussion of certain laws and regulations generally applicable to our operators and in certain cases to us 

fraud and abuse enforcement 

there are various extremely complex us federal and state laws and regulations and in relation to our facilities located in the uk national laws and regulations of england scotland northern ireland and wales governing healthcare providers’ relationships and arrangements and prohibiting fraudulent and abusive practices by such providers these laws include i us federal and state false claims acts and uk antifraud legislation and regulation which among other things prohibit providers from filing false claims or making false statements to receive payment from medicare medicaid or other us federal or state or uk healthcare programs ii us federal and state antikickback and feesplitting statutes including the medicare and medicaid antikickback statute which prohibit or restrict the payment or receipt of remuneration to induce referrals or recommendations of healthcare items or services and uk legislation and regulations on financial inducements and vested interests iii us federal and state physician selfreferral laws commonly referred to as the “stark law” which generally prohibit referrals by physicians to entities with which the physician or an immediate family member has a financial relationship and iv the federal civil monetary penalties law which prohibits among other things the knowing presentation of a false or fraudulent claim for certain healthcare services violations of us and uk healthcare fraud and abuse laws carry civil criminal and administrative sanctions including punitive sanctions monetary penalties imprisonment denial of medicare and medicaid reimbursement and potential exclusion from medicare medicaid or other federal or state healthcare programs these laws are enforced by a variety of federal state and local agencies and in the us can also be enforced by private litigants through among other things federal and state false claims acts which allow private litigants to bring qui tam  or “whistleblower” actions many of our tenants and operators are subject to these laws and may become the subject of governmental enforcement actions or whistleblower actions if they fail to comply with applicable laws additionally beginning in november 2019 the licensed operators of our us longterm care facilities will be required to have compliance and ethics programs that meet the requirements of federal laws and regulations relating to the social security act we have begun the process of developing and implementing such programs 

laws and regulations governing privacy and security 

there are various us federal and state and uk privacy laws and regulations including the privacy and security rules contained in the health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 commonly referred to as “hipaa” and the uk data protection act 1998 which provide for the privacy and security of personal health information an increasing focus of the u s federal trade commission’s “ftc’s” consumer protection regulation is the impact of technological change on protection of consumer privacy the ftc as well as state attorneys general have taken enforcement action against companies that do not abide by their representations to consumers regarding electronic security and privacy to the extent we or our affiliated operating entities are a covered entity or business associate under hipaa and the health information technology for economic and clinical health act the “hitech act” compliance with those requirements would require us to among other things conduct a risk analysis implement a risk management plan implement policies and procedures and conduct employee training in most cases we are dependent on our tenants and management companies to fulfill our compliance obligations and we are in the process of developing programs to comply with aspects of these laws that cannot be delegated to third parties because of the far reaching nature of these laws there can be no assurance that we would not be required to alter one or more of our systems and data security procedures to be in compliance with these laws our failure to protect health information could subject us to civil or criminal liability and adverse publicity and could harm our business and impair our ability to attract new customers and residents we may be required to notify individuals as well as government agencies and the media if we experience a data breach 

reimbursement 

sources of revenue for some of our tenants and operators include among others governmental healthcare programs such as the federal medicare programs and state medicaid programs and in the uk the national health service “nhs” and local authority funding and nongovernmental thirdparty payors such as insurance carriers and hmos as federal and state governments focus on healthcare reform initiatives and as the federal government and many states face significant current and future budget deficits efforts to reduce costs by these payors will likely continue which may result in reduced or slower growth in reimbursement for certain services provided by some of our tenants and operators similarly in the uk the nhs and the local authorities are undertaking efforts to reduce costs which may result in reduced or slower growth in reimbursement for certain services provided by our uk tenants and operators additionally new and evolving payor and provider programs in the us including but not limited to medicare advantage dual eligible accountable care organizations and bundled payments could adversely impact our tenants’ and operators’ liquidity financial condition or results of operations 

healthcare licensure and certificate of need 

certain healthcare facilities in our portfolio including our facilities located in the uk are subject to extensive national federal state and local licensure certification and inspection laws and regulations a healthcare facility’s failure to comply with these laws and regulations could result in a revocation suspension restriction or nonrenewal of the facility’s license and loss of a certificate of need which could adversely affect the facility’s operations and ability to bill for items and services provided at the facility in addition various licenses and permits are required to handle controlled substances including narcotics operate pharmacies handle radioactive materials and operate equipment many states in the us require certain healthcare providers to obtain a certificate of need which requires prior approval for the construction expansion or closure of certain healthcare facilities the approval process related to state certificate of need laws may impact the ability of some of our tenants and operators to expand or change their businesses 

product approvals 

while our life science tenants include some wellestablished companies other tenants are less established and in some cases may not yet have a product approved by the food and drug administration or other regulatory authorities for commercial sale creating a new pharmaceutical product or medical device requires substantial investments of time and capital in part because of the extensive regulation of the healthcare industry it also entails considerable risk of failure in demonstrating that the product is safe and effective and in gaining regulatory approval and market acceptance 

senior housing entrance fee communities 

certain of our senior housing facilities primarily the ccrcs in our unconsolidated joint ventures are operated as entrance fee communities generally an entrance fee is an upfront fee or consideration paid by a resident a portion of which may be refundable in exchange for some form of longterm benefit typically consisting of a right to receive certain personal or health care services some of the entrance fee communities are subject to significant state regulatory oversight including for example oversight of each facility’s financial condition establishment and monitoring of reserve requirements and other financial restrictions the right of residents to cancel their contracts within a specified period of time the right of residents to receive a refund of their entrance fees lien rights in favor of the residents restrictions on change of ownership and similar matters 

americans with disabilities act the “ada” 

our properties must comply with the ada and any similar state or local laws to the extent that such properties are “public accommodations” as defined in those statutes the ada may require removal of barriers to access by persons with disabilities in certain public areas of our properties where such removal is readily achievable to date we have not received any notices of noncompliance with the ada that have caused us to incur substantial capital expenditures to address ada concerns should barriers to access by persons with disabilities be discovered at any of our properties we may be directly or indirectly responsible for additional costs that may be required to make facilities adacompliant noncompliance with the ada could result in the imposition of fines or an award of damages to private litigants the obligation to make readily achievable accommodations pursuant to the ada is an ongoing one and we continue to assess our properties and make modifications as appropriate in this respect 

environmental matters 

a wide variety of federal state and local environmental and occupational health and safety laws and regulations affect healthcare facility operations these complex federal and state statutes and their enforcement involve a myriad of regulations many of which involve strict liability on the part of the potential offender some of these federal and state statutes may directly impact us under various federal state and local environmental laws ordinances and regulations an owner of real property or a secured lender such as us may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of hazardous or toxic substances at under or disposed of in connection with such property as well as other potential costs relating to hazardous or toxic substances including government fines and damages for injuries to persons and adjacent property the cost of any required remediation removal fines or personal or property damages and any related liability therefore could exceed or impair the value of the property andor the assets in addition the presence of such substances or the failure to properly dispose of or remediate such substances may adversely affect the value of such property and the owner’s ability to sell or rent such property or to borrow using such property as collateral which in turn could reduce our earnings for a description of the risks associated with environmental matters see “item 1a risk factors” in this report 

insurance 

we obtain various types of insurance to mitigate the impact of property business interruption liability flood windstorm earthquake fire environmental and terrorismrelated losses we attempt to obtain appropriate policy terms conditions limits and deductibles considering the relative risk of loss the cost of such coverage and current industry practice there are however certain 

types of extraordinary losses such as those due to acts of war or other events that may be either uninsurable or not economically insurable in addition we have a large number of properties that are exposed to earthquake flood and windstorm occurrences which carry higher deductibles 

we maintain property insurance for all of our properties tenants under triplenet leases primarily in our senior housing triplenet segment are required to provide primary property business interruption and liability insurance we maintain separate general and professional liability insurance for our shop facilities additionally our corporate general liability insurance program also extends coverage for all of our properties beyond the aforementioned we periodically review whether we or our ridea operators will bear responsibility for maintaining the required insurance coverage for the applicable shop properties but the costs of such insurance are facility expenses paid from the revenues of those properties regardless of who maintains the insurance 

we also maintain directors and officers liability insurance which provides protection for claims against our directors and officers arising from their responsibilities as directors and officers such insurance also extends to us in certain situations 

sustainability 

we believe that sustainability initiatives are a vital part of corporate responsibility which supports our primary goal of increasing stockholder value through profitable growth we continue to advance our commitment to sustainability with a focus on achieving goals in each of the environmental social and governance “esg” dimensions of sustainability 

our environmental management programs strive to capture cost efficiencies that ultimately benefit our investors tenants operators employees and other stakeholders while providing a positive impact on the communities in which we operate our social responsibility committee leads our local philanthropic and volunteer activities and our transparent corporate governance initiatives incorporate sustainability as a critical component in achieving our business objectives and properly managing risks 

our 2018  sustainability achievements include being recognized by the cdp formerly the carbon disclosure project 2018 climate change program we completed cdp’s annual investor survey for the seventh consecutive year received a score of a for our disclosure and were named to the leadership band cdp collects and publishes the environmental data on behalf of more than 650 investors we were also named a constituent in the ftse4good index for the seventh consecutive year we achieved the green star designation from the global real estate sustainability benchmark gresb we were named a constituent in the north america dow jones sustainability index “djsi” for the sixth consecutive year the list is compiled according to the results of robecosam’s annual corporate sustainability assessment which also determines constituency for the djsi series for additional information regarding our esg sustainability initiatives and our approach to climate change please visit our website at wwwhcpicomsustainability

 item 1a 

risk factors   

tableend the section below discusses the most significant risk factors that may materially adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

as set forth below we believe that the risks we face generally fall into the following categories 



risks related to our business and operations 

we depend on one tenant and operator brookdale for a significant percentage of our revenues and net operating income continuing adverse developments including operational challenges in brookdale’s business and affairs or financial condition would likely have a materially adverse effect on us 

we own our senior housing properties utilizing triplenet lease and ridea structures as of december 31 2018  brookdale i leased 43  properties in our senior housing triplenet segment ii managed on our behalf 35  properties in our shop segment and iii managed 15 ccrcs and one additional shop property owned by our unconsolidated joint ventures with brookdale in our other segment these properties represent a significant portion of our portfolio revenues and operating income 

properties managed by brookdale in our shop segment as of december 31 2018  accounted for 7  of our real estate investments based on total assets under ridea we are required to engage a thirdparty operator such as brookdale that meets the requirements of an “eligible independent contractor” to manage and operate the daytoday business of the properties as required under ridea the operator provides comprehensive property management and accounting services for these properties and we are limited in our ability to control or influence operations accordingly we rely on the operator’s personnel expertise technical resources regulatory compliance programs information systems proprietary information good faith and judgment to manage and operate these properties efficiently and effectively we also must rely on the operator to set appropriate resident fees manage occupancy provide accurate and complete propertylevel financial results for these properties in a timely manner and otherwise operate them in compliance with the terms of our management agreements and all applicable laws and regulations however as the owner of the property under a ridea structure we are ultimately responsible for any operating deficits and other liabilities resulting from the operation of these properties subject to limited exceptions such as gross negligence or willful misconduct by our operators see “—we assume operational risks with respect to our shop properties managed in ridea structures that could have a material adverse effect our business results of operations and financial condition” 

properties leased by brookdale in our triplenet segment accounted for 6  of our total revenues for the year ended december 31 2018  in its capacity as a triplenet tenant brookdale is contractually obligated to pay all insurance tax utilities maintenance and repair expenses in connection with the leased properties brookdale may not have sufficient assets income and access to financing to enable it to satisfy its obligations to us and any failure by brookdale to do so would have a material adverse effect on us in addition we depend on brookdale’s maintenance and repair of the properties to remain competitive and attract and retain patients and residents adverse developments in brookdale’s business and related declining rent coverage ratios have increased its credit risk if these adverse developments result in prolonged inadequate property maintenance or improvements or impair brookdale’s access to capital necessary for maintenance or improvements it could lead to a reduction in occupancy rates and market rents and have a materially adverse effect on us 

brookdale has experienced challenges in recent years including with respect to operational performance and stockholder activism among others brookdale as well as other operators have been adversely affected by increased competition that has negatively impacted occupancy rates as well as by increases in expenses including increased labor costs brookdale’s challenges could divert management’s attention increase employee turnover and impair its ability to operate our properties efficiently and effectively these challenges and any adverse developments in brookdale’s business affairs and financial results could result in among other adverse events declining operational and financial performance of our properties 

we have been in the process of reducing our exposure to brookdale through asset sales and transitions to other operators see “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations— 2018  transaction overview—brookdale transactions update” for more information if we determine to sell or transition additional properties currently leased to or managed by brookdale we may experience operational challenges andor significantly declining financial performance for those properties as we did with brookdale properties sold or transitioned in 2018 any failure of brookdale to maintain the performance of our properties or to meet its obligations to us under its leases and management agreements could materially reduce our cash flow net operating income and results of operations and have other materially adverse effects on our business results of operations and financial condition 

we assume operational risks with respect to our shop properties managed in ridea structures that could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

ridea permits reits such as us to own or partially own qualified healthcare properties in a structure through which we can participate directly in the cash flow of the properties’ operations as compared to receiving only contractual rent payments under a triplenet lease in compliance with reit requirements the criteria for operating a qualified healthcare property in a ridea structure requires us to lease the property to an affiliate trs and for such affiliate trs to engage an independent qualifying management company or operator also known as an eligible independent contractor to manage and operate the daytoday business of the property the operator performs its services in exchange for a management fee as a result under a ridea structure 

we are required to rely on our operator to manage and operate the property including hiring and training all employees entering into all thirdparty contracts for the benefit of the property including residentpatient agreements complying with laws including but not limited to healthcare laws and providing resident care however as the owner of the property under a ridea structure our trs and hence we are ultimately responsible for all operational risks and other liabilities of the property other than those arising out of certain actions by our operator such as gross negligence or willful misconduct operational risks include and our resulting revenues therefore depend on among other things occupancy rates the entrance fees and rental rates charged to residents medicare and medicaid reimbursement rates to the extent applicable our operator’s reputation and ability to attract and retain residents general economic conditions and market factors that impact seniors competition from other senior housing providers compliance with federal state local and industryregulated licensure certification and inspection laws regulations and standards litigation involving our properties or residentspatients the availability and cost of general and professional liability insurance coverage and the ability to control operating expenses although we are permitted under a ridea structure to have certain general oversight approval rights eg budgets material contracts etc and the right to review operational and financial reporting information our operators are ultimately in control of the daytoday business of the property as a result we have limited rights to direct or influence the business or operations of our properties in the shop segment and we depend on our operators to operate these properties in a manner that complies with applicable law minimizes legal risk and maximizes the value of our investment 

when we use a ridea structure our trs is generally required to be the holder of the applicable healthcare license and is the entity that is enrolled in government healthcare programs ie medicare medicaid where applicable as the holder of a healthcare license our trs and we through our ownership interest in our trs are subject to various regulatory laws most states regulate and inspect healthcare property operations patient care construction and the safety of the physical environment however we are required under ridea to rely on our operators to oversee and direct these aspects of the properties’ operations to ensure compliance with these applicable laws and regulations if one or more of our healthcare properties fails to comply with applicable laws our trs would be responsible except in limited circumstances such as the gross negligence or willful misconduct of our operators where we would have a contractual claim against them which could subject our trs to penalties including loss or suspension of licenses and certificates of need certification or accreditation exclusion from government healthcare programs ie medicare medicaid administrative sanctions and civil monetary penalties some states also reserve the right to sanction affiliates of a licensee when they take administrative action against the licensee additionally when we receive individually identifiable health information relating to residents of our healthcare properties we are subject to federal and state data privacy and security laws and rules and could be subject to liability in the event of an audit complaint cybersecurity attack or data breach furthermore our trs has exposure to professional liability claims that could arise out of resident claims such as quality of care and the associated litigation costs 

rents received from the trs in a ridea structure are treated as qualifying rents from real property for reit tax purposes only if i they are paid pursuant to a lease of a “qualified healthcare property” and ii the operator qualifies as an “eligible independent contractor” as defined in the internal revenue code of 1986 as amended the “code” if either of these requirements are not satisfied then the rents will not be qualifying rents 

decreases in our tenants’ operators’ or borrowers’ revenues or increases in their expenses could affect their ability to meet their financial and other contractual obligations to us 

our leases consist of triplenet leases in which we lease our properties directly to tenants and operators as well as ridea leases in which we lease our properties to an affiliate trs that enters into a management agreement with an eligible independent contractor or operator to manage and oversee the daytoday business and operations of the properties we are also a direct or indirect lender to various tenants and operators and separately provide loans to certain third parties we have very limited control over the success or failure of our tenants’ operators’ and borrowers’ businesses regardless of the structure of our relationship with them any of our triplenet tenants or operators under a ridea structure may experience a downturn in their business that materially weakens their financial condition as a result they may fail to make payments or perform their obligations when due although we generally have arrangements and other agreements that give us the right under specified circumstances to terminate a lease evict a tenant or terminate our operator or demand immediate repayment of outstanding loan amounts or other obligations to us we may not be able to enforce such rights or we may determine not to do so if we believe that enforcement of our rights would be more detrimental to our business than seeking alternative approaches 

our senior housing tenants and our shop segment under a ridea structure primarily depend on private sources for their revenues and the ability of their patients and residents to pay fees costs associated with independent and assisted living services are not generally reimbursable under governmental reimbursement programs such as medicare and medicaid accordingly our tenants and operators of our shop segments depend on attracting seniors with appropriate levels of income and assets which may be affected by many factors including prevailing economic and market trends consumer confidence and demographics consequently if our tenants or operators on our behalf fail to effectively conduct their operations or to maintain and improve our properties it could adversely affect our business reputation as the owner of the properties as well as the business reputation of our tenants or 

operators and their ability to attract and retain patients and residents in our properties which could have a materially adverse effect on our and our tenant’s or operator’s business results of operations and financial condition 

our senior housing tenants and our shop segment under a ridea structure also rely on reimbursements from governmental programs for a portion of the revenues from certain properties changes in reimbursement policies and other governmental regulation such as potential changes to or repeal of the patient protection and affordable care act along with the health care and education reconciliation act of 2010 the “affordable care act” that may result from actions by congress or executive orders may result in reductions in our tenants’ revenues or in our revenues from our ridea structures operations and cash flows and affect our tenants’ ability to meet their obligations to us or our financial performance through a ridea structure in addition failure to comply with reimbursement regulations or other laws applicable to healthcare providers could result in penalties fines litigation costs lost revenue or other consequences which could adversely impact our tenants’ ability to make contractual rent payments to us under a triplenet lease or our cash flows from operations under a ridea structure for a further discussion of the legislation and regulation that are applicable to us and our tenants operators and borrowers see “—the requirements of or changes to government reimbursement programs such as medicare or medicaid may adversely affect our tenants’ operators’ and borrowers’ ability to meet their financial and other contractual obligations to us” 

revenues of our senior housing tenants and our shop segment under a ridea structure are also dependent on a number of other factors including licensed bed capacity occupancy the healthcare needs of residents the rate of reimbursement the income and assets of seniors in the regions in which we own properties and social and environmental factors for example due to generally increased vulnerability to illness a severe flu season an epidemic or any other widespread illness could result in early moveouts or delayed moveins during quarantine periods which would reduce our operators’ revenues additionally new and evolving payor and provider programs in the united states including but not limited to medicare advantage dual eligible accountable care organizations bundled payments and other valuebased reimbursement arrangements have resulted in reduced reimbursement rates average length of stay and average daily census particularly for higher acuity patients if our tenants fail to maintain revenues sufficient to meet their financial obligations to us our business results of operations and financial condition would be materially adversely affected similarly if our operators under a ridea structure underperform our business results of operations and financial condition would also be materially adversely affected 

increased competition and market changes have resulted and may further result in lower net revenues for some of our tenants operators and borrowers and may affect their ability to meet their financial and other contractual obligations to us 

the healthcare industry is highly competitive the occupancy levels at and rental income from our properties are dependent on our ability and the ability of our tenants operators and borrowers to compete with other tenants and operators on a number of different levels including the quality of care provided reputation the physical appearance of a property price the range of services offered family preference alternatives for healthcare delivery the supply of competing properties physicians staff referral sources location and the size and demographics of the population in the surrounding area in addition our tenants operators and borrowers face an increasingly competitive labor market for skilled management personnel and nurses an inability to attract and retain skilled management personnel and nurses and other trained personnel could negatively impact the ability of our tenants operators and borrowers to meet their obligations to us a shortage of nurses or other trained personnel union activities or general inflationary pressures on wages may force tenants operators and borrowers to enhance pay and benefits packages to compete effectively for skilled personnel or to use more expensive contract personnel but they be unable to offset these added costs by increasing the rates charged to residents any increase in labor costs and other property operating expenses or any failure by our tenants operators or borrowers to attract and retain qualified personnel could adversely affect our cash flow and have a materially adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

our tenants operators and borrowers also compete with numerous other companies providing similar healthcare services or alternatives such as home health agencies life care at home communitybased service programs retirement communities and convalescent centers this competition which is due in part to overdevelopment in some segments in which we invest has caused the occupancy rate of newly constructed buildings to slow and the monthly rate that many newly built and previously existing properties were able to obtain for their services to decrease our tenants operators and borrowers may be unable to achieve occupancy and rate levels and to manage their expenses in a way that will enable them to meet all of their obligations to us further many competing companies may have resources and attributes that are superior to those of our tenants operators and borrowers our tenants operators and borrowers may encounter increased competition that could limit their ability to maintain or attract residents or expand their businesses or to manage their expenses which could materially adversely affect their ability to meet their financial and other contractual obligations to us potentially decreasing our revenues impairing our assets andor increasing collection and dispute costs 

the financial deterioration insolvency or bankruptcy of one or more of our major tenants operators or borrowers may materially adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

a downturn in any of our tenants’ operators’ or borrowers’ businesses could ultimately lead to voluntary or involuntary bankruptcy or similar insolvency proceedings including but not limited to assignment for the benefit of creditors liquidation or windingup bankruptcy and insolvency laws afford certain rights to a defaulting tenant operator or borrower that has filed for bankruptcy or reorganization that may render certain of our remedies unenforceable or at the least delay our ability to pursue such remedies and realize any related recoveries for example we cannot evict a tenant or operator solely because of its bankruptcy filing 

a debtor has the right to assume or to assume and assign to a third party or to reject its executory contracts and unexpired leases in a bankruptcy proceeding if a debtor were to reject its leases with us obligations under such rejected leases would cease the claim against the rejecting debtor would be an unsecured claim which would be limited by the statutory cap set forth in the us bankruptcy code this statutory cap may be substantially less than the remaining rent actually owed under the lease in addition a debtor may also assert in bankruptcy proceedings that leases should be recharacterized as financing agreements which could result in our being deemed a lender instead of a landlord a lender’s rights and remedies as compared to a landlord’s generally are materially less favorable and our rights as a lender may be subordinated to other creditors’ rights 

furthermore the automatic stay provisions of the us bankruptcy code would preclude us from enforcing our remedies unless we first obtain relief from the court having jurisdiction over the bankruptcy case this would effectively limit or delay our ability to collect unpaid rent or interest payments and we may ultimately not receive any payment at all in addition we would likely be required to fund certain expenses and obligations eg real estate taxes insurance debt costs and maintenance expenses to preserve the value of our properties avoid the imposition of liens on our properties or transition our properties to a new tenant or operator additionally we lease many of our properties to healthcare providers who provide longterm custodial care to the elderly evicting these operators for failure to pay rent while the property is occupied may involve specific procedural or regulatory requirements and may not be successful even if eviction is possible we may determine not to do so due to reputational or other risks 

bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings typically also result in increased costs to the operator significant management distraction and performance declines if we are unable to transition affected properties they would likely experience prolonged operational disruption leading to lower occupancy rates and further depressed revenues publicity about the operator’s financial condition and insolvency proceeds may also negatively impact their and our reputations decreasing customer demand and revenues any or all of these risks could have a material adverse effect on our revenues results of operations and cash flows these risks would be magnified where we lease multiple properties to a single operator under a master lease as an operator failure or default under a master lease would expose us to these risks across multiple properties 

we depend on investments in the healthcare property sector making our profitability more vulnerable to a downturn or slowdown in that specific sector than if we were investing in multiple industries 

we concentrate our investments in the healthcare property sector as a result we are subject to risks inherent to investments in a single industry a downturn or slowdown in the healthcare property sector would have a greater adverse impact on our business than if we had investments in multiple industries specifically a downturn in the healthcare property sector could negatively impact the ability of our tenants operators and borrowers to meet their obligations to us as well as the ability to maintain rental and occupancy rates this could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations in addition a downturn in the healthcare property sector could adversely affect the value of our properties and our ability to sell properties at prices or on terms acceptable to us 

in addition we are exposed to the risks inherent in concentrating our investments in real estate which investments are relatively illiquid due to a number of factors including restrictions on our ability to sell properties under applicable reit tax laws other taxrelated considerations regulatory hurdles and market conditions our ability to quickly sell or transition any of our properties in response to changes in the performance of our properties or economic and other conditions is limited we may be unable to recognize full value for any property that we seek to sell for liquidity reasons our inability to respond rapidly to changes in the performance of our investments could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

tenants and operators that fail to comply with federal state local and international laws and regulations including licensure certification and inspection requirements may cease to operate or be unable to meet their financial and other contractual obligations to us 

our tenants operators and borrowers are subject to or impacted by extensive frequently changing federal state local and international laws and regulations these laws and regulations include among others laws protecting consumers against deceptive practices laws relating to the operation of our properties and how our tenants and operators conduct their business such as fire health and safety data security and privacy laws federal and state laws affecting hospitals clinics and other healthcare communities that participate in both medicare and medicaid that specify reimbursement rates pricing reimbursement procedures and limitations quality of services and care background checks food service and physical plants and similar foreign laws regulating the healthcare 

industry resident rights laws including abuse and neglect laws and fraud laws antikickback and physician referral laws the ada and similar state and local laws and safety and health standards set by the occupational safety and health administration or similar foreign agencies certain of our properties may also require a license registration andor certificate of need to operate 

our tenants’ operators’ or borrowers’ failure to comply with any of these laws regulations or requirements could result in loss of accreditation denial of reimbursement imposition of fines suspension or decertification from government healthcare programs civil liability and in certain limited instances criminal penalties loss of license or closure of the property andor the incurrence of considerable costs arising from an investigation or regulatory action which may have an adverse effect on properties that we own and lease to a third party tenant that we own and operate through a ridea structure or on which we hold a mortgage and therefore may materially adversely impact us see “item 1—business—government regulation licensing and enforcement—healthcare licensure and certificate of need” above 

if we must replace any of our tenants or operators we may have difficulty identifying replacements and we may be required to incur substantial renovation costs to make certain of our healthcare properties suitable for other tenants and operators 

our tenants may not renew existing leases or our operators may not renew their management agreements beyond their current terms if we or our tenants or operators terminate or do not renew the leases or management agreements for our properties we would attempt to reposition those properties with another tenant or operator we may also voluntarily change operators for a variety of reasons for example in november 2017 we announced a plan to transition a significant number of properties managed by brookdale to other operators as part of our strategic plan to reduce our concentration of properties managed or leased by brookdale healthcare properties are typically highly customized the improvements generally required to conform a property to healthcare use such as upgrading electrical gas and plumbing infrastructure are costly and at times tenantspecific and are typically subject to regulatory requirements a new or replacement tenant or operator may require different features in a property depending on that tenant’s or operator’s particular business in addition infrastructure improvements for life science properties typically are significantly more costly than improvements to other property types due to the highly specialized nature of the properties and the greater lease square footage often required by life science tenants we may be unable to recover part or all of these higher costs therefore if a current tenant or operator is unable to pay rent andor vacates a property we may incur substantial expenditures to modify a property and experience delays before we are able to secure another tenant or operator or to accommodate multiple tenants or operators these expenditures or renovations and delays may materially adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

additionally we may fail to identify suitable replacements or enter into leases management agreements or other arrangements with new tenants or operators on a timely basis or on terms as favorable to us as our current leases if at all furthermore during transition periods to new tenants or operators we anticipate that the attention of existing tenants or operators will be diverted from the performance of the properties which would cause the financial and operational performance at these properties to decline for example brookdale properties we intended to sell or transition performed significantly worse during 2018 than our senior housing properties as a whole following a decline in performance we may not be able to rehabilitate the property to previous performance levels which would adversely impact our results of operations we also may be required to fund certain expenses and obligations such as real estate taxes debt costs and maintenance expenses to preserve the value of and avoid the imposition of liens on our properties while they are being repositioned in addition we may incur certain obligations and liabilities including obligations to indemnify the replacement tenant or operator which could have a materially adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

we face additional risks associated with property development and redevelopment that can render a project less profitable or not profitable at all and under certain circumstances prevent completion of development activities once undertaken 

property development and redevelopment is a significant component of our growth strategy at december 31 2018  our active development and redevelopment pipeline was approximately 15 billion  with remaining costs to complete of approximately 913 million largescale groundup development of healthcare properties presents additional risks for us including risks that 



increases in construction costs and debt service expenses or provide tenants or operators with the right to terminate preconstruction leases and 

 any of the foregoing risks could materially adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

changes within the life science industry may adversely impact our revenues and results of operations 

for the year ended december 31 2018  properties in our life science segment accounted for approximately 21  of our total revenues our life science investments could be adversely affected if the life science industry is impacted by an economic financial or banking crisis or if the life science industry migrates from the us to other countries or to areas outside of primary life science markets in south san francisco california san diego california and greater boston massachusetts our ability to negotiate contractual rent escalations on future leases and to achieve increases in rental rates will depend upon market conditions and the demand for life science properties at the time the leases are negotiated and the increases are proposed if economic financial or industry conditions adversely affect our life science tenants we may not be able to lease or release our properties in a timely manner or at favorable rates which would negatively impact our revenues and results of operations for example some of our properties may be better suited for a particular life science industry client tenant and could require modification before we are able to release vacant space to another life science industry client tenant which may delay the releasing process and result in unrecovered costs additionally some of our life science properties may not be suitable for lease to traditional office client tenants without significant expenditures on renovations which could delay an attempt to reposition the property for rent to nonlife science tenants because infrastructure improvements for life science properties typically are significantly more costly than improvements to other property types due to the highly specialized nature of the properties and life science tenants typically require greater lease square footage relative to medical office tenants repositioning efforts would have a disproportionate adverse effect on our life science segment performance see “—if we must replace any of our tenants or operators we may have difficulty identifying replacements and we may be required to incur substantial renovation costs to make certain of our healthcare properties suitable for other tenants and operators” 

it is common for businesses in the life science industry to undergo mergers or consolidations future mergers or consolidations of life science entities could reduce the amount of rentable square footage requirements of our client tenants and prospective client tenants which may adversely impact our revenues from lease payments and results of operations 

our tenants in the life science industry face high levels of regulation funding requirements expense and uncertainty 

life science tenants particularly those involved in developing and marketing pharmaceutical products are subject to certain unique risks including the following 



 if our tenants’ businesses are adversely affected they may fail to make their rent payments to us which could materially adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

the hospitals on whose campuses our mobs are located and their affiliated healthcare systems could fail to remain competitive or financially viable which could adversely impact their ability to attract physicians and physician groups to our mobs and our other properties that serve the healthcare industry 

our mobs and other properties that serve the healthcare industry depend on the viability of the hospitals on whose campuses our mobs are located and their affiliated healthcare systems in order to attract physicians and other healthcarerelated users the viability of these hospitals in turn depends on factors such as the quality and mix of healthcare services provided competition demographic trends in the surrounding community market position and growth potential as well as the ability of the affiliated healthcare systems to provide economies of scale and access to capital if a hospital whose campus is located on or near one of our mobs is unable to meet its financial obligations and if an affiliated healthcare system is unable to support that hospital the hospital may not be able to compete successfully or could be forced to close or relocate which could adversely impact its ability to attract physicians and other healthcarerelated users because we rely on our proximity to and affiliations with these hospitals to create tenant demand for space in our mobs their inability to remain competitive or financially viable or to attract physicians and physician groups could adversely affect our mob operations and have a materially adverse effect on us 

in addition changes to or replacement of the affordable care act and related regulations could result in significant changes to the scope of insurance coverage and reimbursement policies which could put negative pressure on the operations and revenues of our mobs 

we may be unable to maintain or expand our relationships with our existing and future hospital and health system clients 

the success of our medical office portfolio depends to a large extent on past current and future relationships with hospitals and their affiliated health systems we invest significant amounts of time in developing relationships with both new and existing clients if we fail to maintain these relationships including through a lack of responsiveness failure to adapt to the current market or employment of individuals with adequate experience our reputation and relationships will be harmed and we may lose business to competitors if our relationships with hospitals and their affiliated health systems deteriorate it could have a materially adverse effect on us 

economic and other conditions that negatively affect geographic areas from which a greater percentage of our revenue is recognized could materially adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

for the year ended december 31 2018  26  of our revenue was derived from properties located in california which is also where most of our life science portfolio is located as a result we are subject to increased exposure to adverse conditions affecting california including downturns in local economies changes in local real estate conditions increased competition or decreased demand changes in statespecific legislation and local climate events and natural disasters such as earthquakes flooding wildfires and hurricanes which could cause significant disruption in our businesses in the region harm our ability to compete effectively result in increased costs and divert more management attention any or all of which could adversely affect our business and results of operations 

we may experience uninsured or underinsured losses which could result in a significant loss of the capital invested in a property lower than expected future revenues or unanticipated expense 

we maintain and regularly review the comprehensive insurance coverage on our properties with terms conditions limits and deductibles that we believe are adequate and appropriate given the relative risk and costs of such coverage however a large number of our properties are located in areas exposed to earthquake windstorm flood and other natural disasters in particular a significant portion of our life science development projects and approximately 90  of our existing life science portfolio based on gross asset value is concentrated in california which is known to be subject to earthquakes wildfires and other natural disasters while we purchase insurance coverage for earthquake fire windstorm flood and other natural disasters that we believe is adequate in light of current industry practice and analyses prepared by outside consultants such insurance may not fully cover such losses these losses can result in decreased anticipated revenues from a property and the loss of all or a portion of the capital we have invested in a property following these events we may remain liable for any mortgage debt or other financial obligations related 

to the property the insurance market for such exposures can be very volatile and we may be unable to purchase the limits and terms we desire on a commercially reasonable basis in addition there are certain exposures for which we do not purchase insurance because we do not believe it is economically feasible to do so or where there is no viable insurance market 

we maintain earthquake insurance for our properties that are located in the vicinity of active earthquake zones in amounts and with deductibles we believe are commercially reasonable because of our significant concentration in the seismically active regions of south san francisco california and san diego california a damaging earthquake in these areas could significantly impact multiple properties which may amount to a significant portion of our life science portfolio as a result aggregate deductible amounts may be material and our insurance coverage may be materially insufficient to cover our losses either of which would adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

if one of our properties experiences a loss that is uninsured or that exceeds policy coverage limits we could lose our investment in the damaged property as well as the anticipated future cash flows from such property if the damaged property is subject to recourse indebtedness we could continue to be liable for the indebtedness even if the property is irreparably damaged 

in addition even if damage to our properties is covered by insurance a disruption of business caused by a casualty event may result in loss of revenues for us any business interruption insurance may not fully compensate the lender or us for such loss of revenue 

our use of joint ventures may limit our flexibility with jointly owned investments 

we have and may continue to develop andor acquire properties in joint ventures with other persons or entities when circumstances warrant the use of these structures our participation in joint ventures is subject to risks that may not be present with other methods of ownership including 

 for example with respect to our minority ownership position in our unconsolidated ccrc joint venture with brookdale we are limited in our ability to control or influence operations and in our ability to exit or transfer our interest in the joint venture to a third party as a result we may not receive full value for our ownership interest if we tried to sell it to a third party 

in addition in some instances we andor our joint venture partner will have the right to cause us to sell our interest or acquire our partner’s interest at a time when we otherwise would not have initiated such a transaction our ability to acquire our partner’s interest will be limited if we do not have sufficient cash available borrowing capacity or other capital resources this would require us to sell our interest in the joint venture when we would otherwise prefer to retain it any of the foregoing risks could materially adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

we have now and may have in the future contingent rent provisions andor rent escalators based on the consumer price index which could hinder our profitability and growth 

we derive a significant portion of our revenues from leasing properties pursuant to leases that generally provide for fixed rental rates subject to annual escalations under certain leases a portion of the tenant’s rental payment to us is based on the property’s revenues ie contingent rent if as a result of weak economic conditions or other factors the property’s revenue declines our rental revenues would decrease and our results of operations could be materially adversely affected additionally some of our leases provide that annual rent escalates based on changes in the consumer price index or other thresholds ie contingent rent escalators if the consumer price index does not increase or other applicable thresholds are not met rental rates may not increase and our growth and profitability may be hindered furthermore if strong economic conditions result in significant increases in 

the consumer price index but the escalations under our leases with contingent rent escalators are capped our growth and profitability also may be limited 

competition may make it difficult to identify and purchase or develop suitable healthcare properties to grow our investment portfolio to finance acquisitions on favorable terms or to retain or attract tenants and operators 

we face significant competition from other reits investment companies private equity and hedge fund investors sovereign funds healthcare operators lenders developers and other institutional investors some of whom may have greater resources and lower costs of capital than we do increased competition makes it more challenging for us to identify and successfully capitalize on opportunities that meet our business goals and could improve the bargaining power of property owners seeking to sell thereby impeding our investment acquisition and development activities similarly our properties face competition for tenants and operators from other properties in the same market which may affect our ability to attract and retain tenants and operators or may reduce the rents we are able to charge if we cannot capitalize on our development pipeline identify and purchase a sufficient quantity of healthcare properties at favorable prices finance acquisitions on commercially favorable terms or attract and retain profitable tenants and operators our business results of operations and financial condition may be materially adversely affected 

from time to time we have made and we may seek to make one or more material acquisitions which may involve the expenditure of significant funds 

we regularly review potential transactions in order to maximize stockholder value our review process may require significant management attention and a potential transaction could be abandoned or rejected by us or the other parties involved after we expend significant resources and time in addition future acquisitions may require the issuance of securities the incurrence of debt assumption of contingent liabilities or incurrence of significant expenditures each of which could materially adversely impact our business financial condition or results of operations in addition the financing required for acquisitions may not be available on commercially favorable terms or at all 

from time to time we may acquire other companies and if we are unable to successfully integrate these operations our business results of operations and financial condition may be materially adversely affected 

acquisitions require the integration of companies that have previously operated independently successful integration of the operations of these companies depends primarily on our ability to consolidate operations systems procedures properties and personnel and to eliminate redundancies and costs we may encounter difficulties in these integrations potential difficulties associated with acquisitions include our ability to effectively monitor and manage our expanded portfolio of properties the loss of key employees the disruption of our ongoing business or that of the acquired entity possible inconsistencies in standards controls procedures and policies and the assumption of unexpected liabilities including 

 in addition the acquired companies and their properties may fail to perform as expected including in respect of estimated cost savings inaccurate assumptions regarding future rental or occupancy rates could result in overly optimistic estimates of future revenues similarly we may underestimate future operating expenses or the costs necessary to bring properties up to standards established for their intended use or for property improvements 

if we have difficulties with any of these areas or if we later discover additional liabilities or experience unforeseen costs relating to our acquired companies we might not achieve the economic benefits we expect from our acquisitions and this may materially adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

our tenants operators and borrowers face litigation and may experience rising liability and insurance costs 

in some states advocacy groups have been created to monitor the quality of care at healthcare properties and these groups have brought litigation against the tenants and operators of such properties also in several instances private litigation by patients 

residents or “whistleblowers” has sought and sometimes resulted in large damage awards see “risks related to our business and operations—the requirements of or changes to governmental reimbursement programs such as medicare or medicaid may adversely affect our tenants’ operators’ and borrowers’ ability to meet their financial and other contractual obligations to us” the effect of this litigation and other potential litigation may materially increase the costs incurred by our tenants operators and borrowers for monitoring and reporting quality of care compliance which under a ridea structure would be borne by us in addition their cost of liability and medical malpractice insurance can be significant and may increase or not be available at a reasonable cost cost increases could cause our tenants and borrowers to be unable to make their lease or mortgage payments or fail to purchase the appropriate liability and malpractice insurance or cause our borrowers to be unable to meet their obligations to us potentially decreasing our revenues and increasing our collection and litigation costs furthermore with respect to our senior housing properties operated in ridea structures we directly bear the costs of any such increases in litigation monitoring reporting and insurance due to our direct exposure to the cash flows of such properties 

in addition as a result of our ownership of healthcare properties we may be named as a defendant in lawsuits arising from the alleged actions of our tenants or operators with respect to our triplenet leases our tenants generally have agreed to indemnify us for various claims litigation and liabilities in connection with their leasing and operation of our triplenet leased properties with respect to our ridea structured properties we are responsible for these claims litigation and liabilities with limited indemnification rights against our operator typically based on the gross negligence or willful misconduct by the operator although our leases provide us with certain information rights with respect to our tenants one or more of our tenants may be or become party to pending litigation or investigation to which we are unaware or do not have a right to participate or evaluate in such cases we would be unable to determine the potential impact of such litigation or investigation on our tenants or our business or results moreover negative publicity of any of our operators’ or tenants’ litigation other legal proceedings or investigations may also negatively impact their and our reputation resulting in lower customer demand and revenues which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flow 

required regulatory approvals can delay or prohibit transfers of our healthcare properties 

transfers of healthcare properties to successor tenants or operators are typically subject to regulatory approvals or ratifications including but not limited to change of ownership approvals and medicare and medicaid provider arrangements that are not required for transfers of other types of commercial operations and other types of real estate the replacement of any tenant or operator could be delayed by the regulatory approval process of any federal state or local government agency necessary for the transfer of the property or the replacement of the operator licensed to manage the property during which time the property may experience performance declines if we are unable to find a suitable replacement tenant or operator upon favorable terms or at all we may take possession of a property which could expose us to successor liability require us to indemnify subsequent operators to whom we transfer the operating rights and licenses or require us to spend substantial time and funds to preserve the value of the property and adapt the property to other uses all of which may materially adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

compliance with the americans with disabilities act and fire safety and other regulations may require us to make expenditures that adversely affect our cash flows 

our properties must comply with applicable ada and any similar state and local laws this may require removal of barriers to access by persons with disabilities in public areas of our properties noncompliance could result in the incurrence of additional costs associated with bringing the properties into compliance the imposition of fines or an award of damages to private litigants in individual lawsuits or as part of a class action while the tenants to whom we lease our properties are obligated to comply with the ada and similar state and local provisions and typically under tenant leases are obligated to cover costs associated with compliance if required changes involve greater expenditures than anticipated or if the changes must be made on a more accelerated basis than anticipated the ability of these tenants to cover costs could be adversely affected as a result we could be required to expend funds to comply with the provisions of the ada and similar state and local laws on behalf of tenants which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition additionally with respect to our shop properties managed in ridea structures we are ultimately responsible for such litigation and compliance costs due to our direct exposure to the cash flows of the properties 

in addition we are required to operate our properties in compliance with fire and safety regulations building codes and other land use regulations new and revised regulations and codes may be adopted by governmental agencies and bodies and become applicable to our properties for example new safety laws for senior housing properties were adopted following the particularly damaging 2018 hurricane season compliance could require substantial capital expenditures and may restrict our ability to renovate our properties these expenditures and restrictions could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and cash flows 

the requirements of or changes to governmental reimbursement programs such as medicare or medicaid may adversely affect our tenants’ operators’ and borrowers’ ability to meet their financial and other contractual obligations to us 

certain of our tenants operators and borrowers are affected directly or indirectly by an extremely complex set of federal state and local laws and regulations pertaining to governmental reimbursement programs these laws and regulations are subject to frequent and substantial changes that are sometimes applied retroactively see “item 1—business—government regulation licensing and enforcement” for example to the extent that our tenants operators or borrowers receive a significant portion of their revenues from governmental payors primarily medicare and medicaid they are generally subject to among other things 

 the failure to comply with the extensive laws regulations and other requirements applicable to their business and the operation of our properties could result in among other challenges i becoming ineligible to receive reimbursement from governmental reimbursement programs ii becoming subject to prepayment reviews or claims for overpayments iii bans on admissions of new patients or residents iv civil or criminal penalties and v significant operational changes including requirements to increase staffing or the scope of care given to residents these laws and regulations are enforced by a variety of federal state and local agencies and can also be enforced by private litigants through among other things federal and state false claims acts which allow private litigants to bring qui tam or “whistleblower” actions our tenants operators and borrowers could be adversely affected by the resources required to respond to an investigation or other enforcement action in such event the results of operations and financial condition of our tenants and the results of operations of our properties operated by those entities could be materially adversely affected which in turn could have a materially adverse effect on us 

we are unable to predict future federal state and local regulations and legislation including the medicare and medicaid statutes and regulations or the intensity of enforcement efforts with respect to such regulations and legislation any changes in the regulatory framework could have a materially adverse effect on our tenants and operators if in turn such tenants or operators fail to make contractual rent payments to us or with respect to our shop segment cash flows are adversely affected it could have a materially adverse effect on us 

sometimes governmental payors freeze or reduce payments to healthcare providers or provide annual reimbursement rate increases that are smaller than expected due to budgetary and other pressures healthcare reimbursement will likely continue to be of significant importance to federal and state authorities we cannot make any assessment as to the ultimate timing or the effect that any future legislative reforms may have on our tenants’ operators’ and borrowers’ costs of doing business and on the amount of reimbursement by government and other thirdparty payors the failure of any of our tenants operators or borrowers to comply with these laws and regulations and significant limits on the scope of services reimbursed and on reimbursement rates and fees could materially adversely affect their ability to meet their financial and contractual obligations to us 

furthermore executive orders and legislation may amend or repeal the affordable care act and related regulations in whole or in part a federal court in texas recently declared the affordable care act’s individual mandate unconstitutional and the remaining provisions nonseverable from the mandate thus making them invalid  texas v united states  case 418cv001671 slip opinion nd tex dec 14 2018 the decision has been stayed pending appeal we also anticipate that congress state legislatures and thirdparty payors may continue to review and assess alternative healthcare delivery and payment systems and may propose and adopt legislation or policy changes or implementations effecting additional fundamental changes in the healthcare system for example the department of health and human services has focused on tying medicare payments to quality or value through 

alternative payment models which generally aim to make providers attentive to the total costs of treatments additionally the centers for medicare and medicaid services recently finalized a new patient driven payment model which effective october 1 2019 will be used to calculate reimbursement rates for patients in skilled nursing properties we cannot quantify or predict the likely impact of these changes on the revenues and profitability of our tenants operators and borrowers however if any such changes significantly and adversely affect our tenants’ profitability they could in turn negatively affect our tenants’ ability and willingness to comply with the terms of their leases with us andor renew their leases with us upon expiration which could impact our business prospects financial condition or results of operations 

legislation to address federal government operations and administration decisions affecting the centers for medicare and medicaid services could have a materially adverse effect on our tenants’ operators’ and borrowers’ liquidity financial condition or results of operations 

congressional consideration of legislation pertaining to the federal debt ceiling the affordable care act tax reform and entitlement programs including reimbursement rates for physicians could have a materially adverse effect on our tenants’ operators’ and borrowers’ liquidity financial condition or results of operations in particular reduced funding for entitlement programs such as medicare and medicaid would result in increased costs and fees for programs such as medicare advantage plans and additional reductions in reimbursements to providers amendments to or repeal of the affordable care act in whole or in part and decisions by the centers for medicare and medicaid services could impact the delivery of services and benefits under medicare medicaid or medicare advantage plans and could affect our tenants and operators and the manner in which they are reimbursed by such programs such changes could have a materially adverse effect on our tenants’ operators’ and borrowers’ liquidity financial condition or results of operations which could adversely affect their ability to satisfy their obligations to us and could have a materially adverse effect on us 

we may be unable to successfully foreclose on the collateral securing our real estaterelated loans and even if we are successful in our foreclosure efforts we may be unable to successfully operate occupy or reposition the underlying real estate which may adversely affect our ability to recover our investments 

if a tenant or operator defaults under one of our mortgages or mezzanine loans we may have to foreclose on the loan or protect our interest by acquiring title to the collateral and thereafter making substantial improvements or repairs in order to maximize the property’s investment potential in some cases the collateral consists of the equity interests in an entity that directly or indirectly owns the applicable real property or interests in operating properties and accordingly we may not have full recourse to assets of that entity or that entity may have incurred unexpected liabilities tenants operators or borrowers may contest enforcement of foreclosure or other remedies seek bankruptcy protection against our exercise of enforcement or other remedies andor bring claims for lender liability in response to actions to enforce mortgage obligations foreclosurerelated costs high loantovalue ratios or declines in the value of the property may prevent us from realizing an amount equal to our mortgage or mezzanine loan upon foreclosure and we may be required to record a valuation allowance for such losses even if we are able to successfully foreclose on the collateral securing our real estaterelated loans we may inherit properties for which we may be unable to expeditiously secure tenants or operators if at all or we may acquire equity interests that we are unable to immediately resell due to limitations under the securities laws either of which would adversely affect our ability to fully recover our investment 

risks related to our capital structure and market conditions 

changes or increases in interest rates could result in a decrease in our stock price and increased interest costs on new debt and existing variable rate debt which could materially adversely impact our ability to refinance existing debt sell properties and conduct acquisition investment and development activities 

an increase in interest rates could reduce the amount investors are willing to pay for our common stock because reit stocks are often perceived as highyield investments investors may perceive less relative benefit to owning reit stocks as interest rates and the yield on government treasuries and other bonds increase 

additionally we have existing debt obligations that are variable rate obligations with interest and related payments that vary with the movement of certain indices if interest rates increase so would our interest costs for any variable rate debt and for new debt this increased cost would make the financing of any acquisition and development activity more costly in addition an increase in interest rates could decrease the amount third parties are willing to pay for our properties thereby limiting our ability to reposition our portfolio promptly in response to changes in economic or other conditions 

rising interest rates could limit our ability to refinance existing debt when it matures or cause us to pay higher interest rates upon refinancing and increase interest expense on refinanced indebtedness for example we have 800 million of senior notes that are maturing in 2020 on which we pay 2625 interest which is lower than prevailing interest rates throughout 2018 if interest rates 

remain higher than the interest rates of our senior notes reaching maturity we will incur additional interest expense upon any replacement debt 

we manage a portion of our exposure to interest rate risk by accessing debt with staggered maturities and through the use of derivative instruments primarily interest rate swap agreements however no amount of hedging activity can fully insulate us from the risks associated with changes in interest rates swap agreements involve risk including that counterparties may fail to honor their obligations under these arrangements that these arrangements may not be effective in reducing our exposure to interest rate changes that the amount of income we earn from hedging transactions may be limited by federal tax provisions governing reits and that these arrangements may cause us to pay higher interest rates on our debt obligations than would otherwise be the case failure to hedge effectively against interest rate risk could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

cash available for distribution to stockholders may be insufficient to make dividend distributions at expected levels and are made at the discretion of our board of directors 

if cash available for distribution generated by our properties decreases as a result of our announced dispositions or otherwise we may be unable to make dividend distributions at expected levels our inability to make expected distributions would likely result in a decrease in the market price of our common stock all distributions are made at the discretion of our board of directors in accordance with maryland law and depend on our earnings our financial condition debt and equity capital available to us our expectations of our future capital requirements and operating performance restrictive covenants in our financial or other contractual arrangements including those in our credit facility agreement maintenance of our reit qualification restrictions under maryland law and other factors as our board of directors may deem relevant from time to time additionally our ability to make distributions will be adversely affected if any of the risks described herein or other significant adverse events occur 

we rely on external sources of capital to fund future capital needs and if access to such capital is unavailable on acceptable terms or at all it could have a materially adverse effect on our ability to meet commitments as they become due or make future investments necessary to grow our business 

we may not be able to fund all future capital needs including capital expenditures debt maturities and other commitments from cash retained from operations and dispositions if we are unable to obtain enough internal capital we may need to rely on external sources of capital including debt and equity financing to fulfill our capital requirements our access to capital depends upon a number of factors some of which we have little or no control over including but not limited to 

 if access to capital is unavailable on acceptable terms or at all it could have a materially adverse impact on our ability to fund operations repay or refinance our debt obligations fund dividend payments acquire properties and make the investments needed to grow our business 

adverse changes in our credit ratings could impair our ability to obtain additional debt and equity financing on favorable terms if at all and negatively impact the market price of our securities including our common stock 

our credit ratings can affect the amount and type of capital we can access as well as the terms of any financing we may obtain the credit ratings of our senior unsecured debt are based on among other things our operating performance liquidity and leverage ratios overall financial position level of indebtedness and pending or future changes in the regulatory framework applicable to our operators and our industry we may be unable to maintain our current credit ratings and in the event that our current credit ratings deteriorate we would likely incur higher borrowing costs which would make it more difficult or expensive to obtain additional financing or refinance existing obligations and commitments also a downgrade in our credit ratings would trigger additional costs or other potentially negative consequences under our current and future credit facilities and debt instruments 

our level of indebtedness may increase and materially adversely affect our future operations 

our outstanding indebtedness as of december 31 2018  was approximately 56 billion  we may incur additional indebtedness including in connection with the development or acquisition of properties which may be substantial any significant additional indebtedness would likely negatively affect the credit ratings of our debt and require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow to interest and principal payments due on our indebtedness greater demands on our cash resources may reduce funds available to us to pay dividends conduct development activities make capital expenditures and acquisitions or carry out other aspects of our business strategy increased indebtedness can also make us more vulnerable to general adverse economic and industry conditions and create competitive disadvantages for us compared to other companies with relatively lower debt levels increased future debt service obligations may limit our operational flexibility including our ability to finance or refinance our properties contribute properties to joint ventures or sell properties as needed 

covenants in our debt instruments limit our operational flexibility and breaches of these covenants could materially adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

the terms of our current secured and unsecured debt instruments and other indebtedness that we may incur require or will require us to comply with a number of customary financial and other covenants such as maintaining leverage ratios minimum tangible net worth requirements reit status and certain levels of debt service coverage our continued ability to incur additional debt and to conduct business in general is subject to compliance with these financial and other covenants which limit our operational flexibility for example mortgages on our properties contain customary covenants such as those that limit or restrict our ability without the consent of the lender to further encumber or sell the applicable properties or to replace the applicable tenant or operator breaches of certain covenants may result in defaults under the mortgages on our properties and crossdefaults under certain of our other indebtedness even if we satisfy our payment obligations to the respective obligee   covenants that limit our operational flexibility as well as defaults resulting from the breach of any of these covenants could materially adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

volatility disruption or uncertainty in the financial markets may impair our ability to raise capital obtain new financing or refinance existing obligations and fund real estate and development activities 

we may be affected by general market and economic conditions increased or prolonged market disruption volatility or uncertainty could materially adversely impact our ability to raise capital obtain new financing or refinance our existing obligations as they mature and fund real estate and development activities market volatility could also lead to significant uncertainty in the valuation of our investments and those of our joint ventures which may result in a substantial decrease in the value of our properties and those of our joint ventures as a result we may be unable to recover the carrying amount of such investments and the associated goodwill if any which may require us to recognize impairment charges in earnings 

we may be adversely affected by fluctuations in currency exchange rates 

we have certain investments in international markets where the us dollar is not the denominated currency the ownership of investments located outside of the united states subjects us to risk from fluctuations in exchange rates between foreign currencies and the us dollar a significant change in the value of the british pound sterling “gbp” may have a materially adverse effect on our financial position debt covenant ratios results of operations and cash flow 

we may attempt to manage the impact of foreign currency exchange rate changes through the use of derivative contracts or other methods for example we currently utilize gbp denominated liabilities as a natural hedge against our gbp denominated assets additionally we executed currency swap contracts to hedge the risk related to a portion of the forecasted interest receipts on these investments however no amount of hedging activity can fully insulate us from the risks associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates and the failure to hedge effectively against foreign currency exchange rate risk if we choose to engage in such activities could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition in addition any international 

currency gain recognized with respect to changes in exchange rates may not qualify under the 75 gross income test or the 95 gross income test that we must satisfy annually in order to qualify and maintain our status as a reit 

risk related to other events 

we rely on information technology in our operations and any material failure inadequacy interruption or security failure of that technology could harm our business 

we rely on information technology networks and systems including the internet to process transmit and store electronic information and to manage or support a variety of business processes including financial transactions and records and maintaining personal identifying information and tenant and lease data we purchase some of our information technology from vendors on whom our systems depend we rely on commercially available systems software tools and monitoring to provide security for the processing transmission and storage of confidential tenant and customer data including individually identifiable information relating to financial accounts although we have taken steps to protect the security of our information systems and the data maintained in those systems it is possible that our safety and security measures will not prevent the systems’ improper functioning or damage or the improper access or disclosure of personally identifiable information such as in the event of cyberattacks the risk of security breaches has generally increased as the number intensity and sophistication of attacks and intrusions have increased in addition the pace and unpredictability of cyber threats generally quickly renders longterm implementation plans designed to address cybersecurity risks obsolete because our operators also rely on information technology networks systems and software we may be exposed to cyberattacks on our operators 

security breaches of our or our operators’ networks and systems including those caused by physical or electronic breakins computer viruses malware worms attacks by hackers or foreign governments disruptions from unauthorized access and tampering including through social engineering such as phishing attacks coordinated denialofservice attacks and similar breaches could result in among other things system disruptions shutdowns unauthorized access to or disclosure of confidential information misappropriation of our or our business partners’ proprietary or confidential information breach of our legal regulatory or contractual obligations inability to access or rely upon critical business records or systems or other delays in our operations in some cases it may be difficult to anticipate or immediately detect such incidents and the damage they cause we may be required to expend significant financial resources to protect against or to remediate such security breaches in addition our technology infrastructure and information systems are vulnerable to damage or interruption from natural disasters power loss and telecommunications failures any failure to maintain proper function security and availability of our and our operators’ information systems and the data maintained in those systems could interrupt our operations damage our reputation subject us to liability claims or regulatory penalties harm our business relationships or increase our security and insurance costs which could have a materially adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we are subject to certain provisions of maryland law and our charter relating to business combinations which may prevent a transaction that may otherwise be in the interest of our stockholders 

the maryland business combination act provides that unless exempted a maryland corporation may not engage in business combinations including a merger consolidation share exchange or in circumstances specified in the statute an asset transfer or issuance or reclassification of equity securities with an “interested stockholder” or an affiliate of an interested stockholder for five years after the most recent date on which the interested stockholder became an interested stockholder and thereafter unless specified criteria are met an interested stockholder is generally a person owning or controlling directly or indirectly 10 or more of the voting power of the outstanding voting stock of a maryland corporation unless our board of directors takes action to exempt us generally or with respect to certain transactions from this statute the maryland business combination act will be applicable to business combinations between us and other persons 

in addition to the restrictions on business combinations contained in the maryland business combination act our charter also contains restrictions on business combinations our charter requires that except in certain circumstances “business combinations” including a merger or consolidation and certain asset transfers and issuances of securities with a “related person” including a beneficial owner of 10 or more of our outstanding voting stock be approved by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 90 of our outstanding voting stock 

the restrictions on business combinations provided under maryland law and contained in our charter may delay defer or prevent a change of control or other transaction even if such transaction involves a premium price for our common stock or our stockholders believe that such transaction is otherwise in their best interests 

unfavorable resolution of litigation matters and disputes could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition 

from time to time we are involved in legal proceedings lawsuits and other claims we may also be named as defendants in lawsuits arising out of our alleged actions or the alleged actions of our tenants and operators for which such tenants and operators have agreed to indemnify defend and hold us harmless an unfavorable resolution of any such litigation may have a materially adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition regardless of the outcome litigation or other legal proceedings may result in substantial costs disruption of our normal business operations and the diversion of management attention we may be unable to prevail in or achieve a favorable settlement of any pending or future legal action against us see item 3—legal proceedings of this annual report on form 10k 

loss of our key personnel could temporarily disrupt our operations and adversely affect us 

we depend on the efforts of our executive officers for the success of our business and competition for these individuals is intense although they are covered by our executive severance plan and change in control plan which provide many of the benefits typically found in executive employment agreements none of our executive officers have employment agreements with us the loss or limited availability of the services of any of our executive officers or our inability to recruit and retain qualified personnel could at least temporarily have a materially adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition and the value of our common stock 

environmental compliance costs and liabilities associated with our real estaterelated investments may be substantial and may materially impair the value of those investments 

federal state and local laws ordinances and regulations may require us as a current or previous owner of real estate to investigate and clean up certain hazardous or toxic substances or petroleum released at a property we may be held liable to a governmental entity or to third parties for property damage and for investigation and cleanup costs incurred by the third parties in connection with the contamination the costs of cleanup and remediation could be substantial in addition some environmental laws create a lien on the contaminated site in favor of the government for damages and the costs it incurs in connection with the contamination 

although we currently carry environmental insurance on our properties in an amount that we believe is commercially reasonable and generally require our tenants and operators to indemnify us for environmental liabilities they cause such liabilities could exceed the amount of our insurance the financial ability of the tenant or operator to indemnify us or the value of the contaminated property as the owner of a site we may also be held liable to third parties for damages and injuries resulting from environmental contamination emanating from the site we may also experience environmental liabilities arising from conditions not known to us the cost of defending against these claims complying with environmental regulatory requirements conducting remediation of any contaminated property or paying personal injury or other claims or fines could be substantial and could have a materially adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

in addition the presence of contamination or the failure to remediate contamination may materially adversely affect our ability to use sell or lease the property or to borrow using the property as collateral 

risk related to tax including reitrelated risks 

loss of our tax status as a reit would substantially reduce our available funds and would have materially adverse consequences for us and the value of our common stock 

qualification as a reit involves the application of numerous highly technical and complex provisions of the code for which there are only limited judicial and administrative interpretations as well as the determination of various factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control we intend to continue to operate in a manner that enables us to qualify as a reit however our qualification and taxation as a reit depend upon our ability to meet through actual annual operating results asset diversification distribution levels and diversity of stock ownership the various qualification tests imposed under the code for example to qualify as a reit at least 95 of our gross income in any year must be derived from qualifying sources and we must make distributions to our stockholders aggregating annually to at least 90 of our reit taxable income excluding net capital gains in addition new legislation regulations administrative interpretations or court decisions could change the tax laws or interpretations of the tax laws regarding qualification as a reit or the federal income tax consequences of that qualification in a manner that is materially adverse to our stockholders accordingly there is no assurance that we have operated or will continue to operate in a manner so as to qualify or remain qualified as a reit 

if we lose our reit status we will face serious tax consequences that will substantially reduce the funds available to make payments of principal and interest on the debt securities we issue and to make distributions to stockholders if we fail to qualify as a reit 

 as a result of all these factors our failure to qualify as a reit could also impair our ability to expand our business and raise capital and could materially adversely affect the value of our common stock 

recent changes to the us tax laws could have a significant negative impact on the overall economy our tenants and our business 

on december 20 2017 the house of representatives and the senate passed a tax reform bill which was signed into law on december 22 2017 the “tax reform legislation” among other things the tax reform legislation 

 many of the provisions in the tax reform legislation expire at the end of 2025 

the tax reform legislation was a farreaching and complex revision to the existing us federal income tax laws with disparate and in some cases countervailing impacts on different categories of taxpayers and industries and will require subsequent rulemaking and interpretation in a number of areas as a result we cannot predict the longterm impact of the tax reform legislation on the overall economy government revenues our tenants us and the real estate industry furthermore the tax reform legislation may negatively impact certain of our tenants’ operating results financial condition and future business plans this in turn could negatively impact our operating results financial condition and operations 

further changes to us federal income tax laws could materially and adversely affect us and our stockholders 

the present federal income tax treatment of reits may be modified possibly with retroactive effect by legislative judicial or administrative action at any time which could affect the federal income tax treatment of an investment in us the federal income tax rules dealing with us federal income taxation and reits are constantly under review by persons involved in the legislative process the us internal revenue service the “irs” and the us treasury department which results in statutory changes as well as frequent revisions to regulations and interpretations we cannot predict how changes in the tax laws might affect our investors or us revisions in federal tax laws and interpretations thereof could significantly and negatively affect our ability to qualify as a reit as well as the tax considerations relevant to an investment in us or could cause us to change our investments and commitments 

we could have potential deferred and contingent tax liabilities from corporate acquisitions that could limit delay or impede future sales of our properties 

if during the fiveyear period beginning on the date we acquire certain companies we recognize a gain on the disposition of any property acquired then to the extent of the excess of i the fair market value of such property as of the acquisition date over ii our adjusted income tax basis in such property as of that date we will be required to pay a corporatelevel federal income tax on this gain at the highest regular corporate rate there can be no assurance that these triggering dispositions will not occur and these requirements could limit delay or impede future sales of our properties 

in addition the irs may assert liabilities against us for corporate income taxes for taxable years prior to the time that we acquire certain companies in which case we will owe these taxes plus interest and penalties if any 

there are uncertainties relating to the calculation of nonreit tax earnings and profits “ep” in certain acquisitions which may require us to distribute ep 

in order to remain qualified as a reit we are required to distribute to our stockholders all of the accumulated nonreit ep of certain companies that we acquire prior to the close of the first taxable year in which the acquisition occurs failure to make such ep distributions would result in our disqualification as a reit the determination of the amount to be distributed in such ep distributions is a complex factual and legal determination we may have less than complete information at the time we undertake our analysis or we may interpret the applicable law differently from the irs we currently believe that we have satisfied the requirements relating to such ep distributions there are however substantial uncertainties relating to the determination of ep including the possibility that the irs could successfully assert that the taxable income of the companies acquired should be increased which would increase our nonreit ep moreover an audit of the acquired company following our acquisition could result in an increase in accumulated nonreit ep which could require us to pay an additional taxable distribution to our thenexisting stockholders if we qualify under rules for curing this type of default or could result in our disqualification as a reit 

thus we might fail to satisfy the requirement that we distribute all of our nonreit ep by the close of the first taxable year in which the acquisition occurs moreover although there are procedures available to cure a failure to distribute all of our ep we cannot now determine whether we will be able to take advantage of these procedures or the economic impact on us of doing so 

our international investments and operations may result in additional taxrelated risks 

we own a 49 noncontrolling interest in a joint venture that owns senior housing properties in the uk although we expect to sell our remaining 49 interest in the joint venture by no later than 2020 we currently remain exposed to risks associated with international investments and operations including taxrelated risks which are different from those we face with respect to our domestic properties and operations these risks include but are not limited to 

 our charter contains ownership limits with respect to our common stock and other classes of capital stock 

our charter contains restrictions on the ownership and transfer of our common stock and preferred stock that are intended to assist us in preserving our qualification as a reit under our charter subject to certain exceptions no person or entity may own actually or constructively more than 98 by value or by number of shares whichever is more restrictive of the outstanding shares of our common stock or any class or series of our preferred stock 

additionally our charter has a 99 ownership limitation on the direct or indirect ownership of our voting shares which may include common stock or other classes of capital stock our board of directors in its sole discretion may exempt a proposed transferee from either ownership limit the ownership limits may delay defer or prevent a transaction or a change of control that might involve a premium price for our common stock or might otherwise be in the best interests of our stockholders

we evaluate our business and allocate resources among our reportable business segments i senior housing triplenet ii senior housing operating portfolio shop iii life science and iv medical office   under the medical office and life science segments we invest through the acquisition and development of mobs and life science facilities which generally require a greater level of property management our senior housing facilities are managed utilizing triplenet leases and ridea structures we have other nonreportable segments that are comprised primarily of our debt investments hospital properties unconsolidated joint ventures and uk investments we evaluate performance based upon i property net operating income from continuing operations “noi” and ii adjusted noi cash noi in each segment the accounting policies of the segments are the same as those described in the summary of significant accounting policies see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements 

nongaap financial measures 

net operating income 

noi and adjusted noi are nonus generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” supplemental financial measures used to evaluate the operating performance of real estate noi is defined as real estate revenues inclusive of rental and related revenues resident fees and services and income from direct financing leases less property level operating expenses which exclude transition costs noi excludes all other financial statement amounts included in net income loss  as presented in note 13 to the consolidated financial statements management believes noi provides relevant and useful information because it reflects only income and operating expense items that are incurred at the property level and presents them on an unlevered basis adjusted noi is calculated as noi after eliminating the effects of straightline rents dfl noncash interest amortization of market lease intangibles termination fees actuarial reserves for insurance claims that have been incurred but not reported and the impact of deferred community fee income and expense adjusted noi is oftentimes referred to as “cash noi” noi and adjusted noi exclude our share of income loss generated by unconsolidated joint ventures which is recognized in equity income loss from unconsolidated joint ventures in the consolidated statements of operations we use noi and adjusted noi to make decisions about resource allocations to assess and compare property level performance and to evaluate our same property portfolio “spp” as described below we believe that net income loss is the most directly comparable gaap measure to noi and adjusted noi noi and adjusted noi should not be viewed as alternative measures of operating performance to net income loss as defined by gaap since they do not reflect various excluded items further our definitions of noi and adjusted noi may not be comparable to the definitions used by other reits or real estate companies as they may use different methodologies for calculating noi and adjusted noi for a reconciliation of noi and adjusted noi to net income loss by segment refer to note 13 to the consolidated financial statements 

operating expenses generally relate to leased medical office and life science properties and shop facilities we generally recover all or a portion of our leased medical office and life science property expenses through tenant recoveries we present expenses as operating or general and administrative based on the underlying nature of the expense 

same property portfolio 

spp noi and adjusted cash noi information allows us to evaluate the performance of our property portfolio under a consistent population by eliminating changes in the composition of our consolidated portfolio of properties spp noi excludes certain nonproperty specific operating expenses that are allocated to each operating segment on a consolidated basis 

properties are included in spp once they are stabilized for the full period in both comparison periods newly acquired operating assets are generally considered stabilized at the earlier of leaseup typically when the tenants controls the physical use of at least 80 of the space or 12 months from the acquisition date newly completed developments and redevelopments are considered stabilized at the earlier of leaseup or 24 months from the date the property is placed in service properties that experience a change in reporting structure such as a transition from a triplenet lease to a ridea reporting structure are considered stabilized after 12 months in operations under a consistent reporting structure a property is removed from spp when it is classified as held for sale sold placed into redevelopment experiences a casualty event that significantly impacts operations or changes its reporting structure such as triplenet to shop 

for a reconciliation of spp to total portfolio adjusted noi and other relevant disclosures by segment refer to our segment analysis below 

funds from operations ffo 

ffo encompasses nareit ffo and ffo as adjusted each of which is described in detail below we believe ffo applicable to common shares diluted ffo applicable to common shares and diluted ffo per common share are important supplemental nongaap measures of operating performance for a reit because the historical cost accounting convention used for real estate assets utilizes straightline depreciation except on land such accounting presentation implies that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time since real estate values instead have historically risen and fallen with market conditions presentations of operating results for a reit that use historical cost accounting for depreciation could be less informative the term ffo was designed by the reit industry to address this issue 

nareit ffo  ffo as defined by the national association of real estate investment trusts “nareit” is net income loss applicable to common shares computed in accordance with gaap excluding gains or losses from sales of depreciable property including any current and deferred taxes directly associated with sales of depreciable property impairments of or related to depreciable real estate plus real estate and other real estaterelated depreciation and amortization and adjustments to compute our share of nareit ffo and ffo as adjusted see below from joint ventures adjustments for joint ventures are calculated to reflect our prorata share of both our consolidated and unconsolidated joint ventures we reflect our share of nareit ffo for unconsolidated joint ventures by applying our actual ownership percentage for the period to the applicable reconciling items on an entity by entity basis for consolidated joint ventures in which we do not own 100 we reflect our share of the equity by adjusting our nareit ffo to remove the third party ownership share of the applicable reconciling items based on actual ownership percentage for the applicable periods our prorata share information is prepared on a basis consistent with the comparable consolidated amounts is intended to reflect our proportionate economic interest in the operating results of properties in our portfolio and is calculated by applying our actual ownership percentage for the period we do not control the unconsolidated joint ventures and the prorata presentations of reconciling items included in nareit ffo do not represent our legal claim to such items the joint venture members or partners are entitled to profit or loss allocations and distributions of cash flows according to the joint venture agreements which provide for such allocations generally according to their invested capital 

the presentation of prorata information has limitations which include but are not limited to the following i the amounts shown on the individual line items were derived by applying our overall economic ownership interest percentage determined when applying the equity method of accounting and do not necessarily represent our legal claim to the assets and liabilities or the revenues and expenses and ii other companies in our industry may calculate their prorata interest differently limiting the usefulness as a comparative measure because of these limitations the prorata financial information should not be considered independently or as a substitute for our financial statements as reported under gaap we compensate for these limitations by relying primarily on our gaap financial statements using the prorata financial information as a supplement 

nareit ffo does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with gaap is not necessarily indicative of cash available to fund cash needs and should not be considered an alternative to net income loss we compute nareit ffo in accordance with the current nareit definition however other reits may report nareit ffo differently or have a different interpretation of the current nareit definition from ours 

ffo as adjusted  in addition we present nareit ffo on an adjusted basis before the impact of noncomparable items including but not limited to transactionrelated items impairments recoveries of nondepreciable assets losses gains from the sale of nondepreciable assets severance and related charges prepayment costs benefits associated with early retirement or payment of debt litigation costs recoveries casualtyrelated charges recoveries foreign currency remeasurement losses gains and changes in tax legislation “ffo as adjusted” transactionrelated items include transaction expenses and gainscharges incurred as a result of mergers and acquisitions and lease amendment or termination activities prepayment costs benefits associated with 

early retirement of debt include the writeoff of unamortized deferred financing fees or additional costs expenses discounts makewhole payments penalties or premiums incurred as a result of early retirement or payment of debt management believes that ffo as adjusted provides a meaningful supplemental measurement of our ffo runrate and is frequently used by analysts investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of our performance as a reit at the same time that nareit created and defined its ffo measure for the reit industry it also recognized that “management of each of its member companies has the responsibility and authority to publish financial information that it regards as useful to the financial community” we believe stockholders potential investors and financial analysts who review our operating performance are best served by an ffo runrate earnings measure that includes certain other adjustments to net income loss in addition to adjustments made to arrive at the nareit defined measure of ffo ffo as adjusted is used by management in analyzing our business and the performance of our properties and we believe it is important that stockholders potential investors and financial analysts understand this measure used by management we use ffo as adjusted to i evaluate our performance in comparison with expected results and results of previous periods relative to resource allocation decisions ii evaluate the performance of our management iii budget and forecast future results to assist in the allocation of resources iv assess our performance as compared with similar real estate companies and the industry in general and v evaluate how a specific potential investment will impact our future results other reits or real estate companies may use different methodologies for calculating an adjusted ffo measure and accordingly our ffo as adjusted may not be comparable to those reported by other reits  for a reconciliation of net income loss to nareit ffo and ffo as adjusted and other relevant disclosure refer to “nongaap financial measures reconciliations” below

liquidity and capital resources 

we anticipate that our cash flow from operations available cash balances and cash from our various financing activities will be adequate for at least the next 12 months for purposes of i funding recurring operating expenses ii meeting debt service requirements including principal payments and maturities and iii satisfying our distributions to our stockholders and noncontrolling interest members

see note 10 in the consolidated financial statements for information about our outstanding debt 

see “ 2018  transaction overview” for further information regarding our significant financing activities during the year ended december 31 2018  

approximately 98  84  and 83  of our total debt inclusive of 43 million  44 million  and 46 million  of variable rate debt swapped to fixed through interest rate swaps was fixed rate debt as of december 31 2018  2017  and 2016  respectively at december 31 2018  our fixed rate debt and variable rate debt had weighted average interest rates of 404  and 215  respectively at december 31 2017  our fixed rate debt and variable rate debt had weighted average interest rates of 419  and 256  respectively at december 31 2016  our fixed rate debt and variable rate debt had weighted average interest rates of 426  and 223  respectively for a more detailed discussion of our interest rate risk see “quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk” in item 3 below 

equity 

at december 31 2018  we had 477 million  shares of common stock outstanding equity totaled 65 billion  and our equity securities had a market value of 135 billion  

at december 31 2018  nonmanaging members held an aggregate of four million  units in five  limited liability companies “downreits” for which we are the managing member the downreit units are exchangeable for an amount of cash approximating the thencurrent market value of shares of our common stock or at our option shares of our common stock subject to certain adjustments such as stock splits and reclassifications 

we renewed our atthemarket equity program in may 2018 pursuant to which we may sell shares of our common stock having an aggregate gross sales price of up to 750 million through a consortium of banks acting as sales agents or directly to the banks acting as principals during the year ended december 31 2018  we issued 54 million  shares of common stock at a weighted average net price of 2827  for net proceeds of 154 million  gross proceeds of 156 million net of 2 million of fees paid to sales agents at december 31 2018  594 million  of our common stock remained available for sale under the atthemarket program actual future sales will depend upon a variety of factors including but not limited to market conditions the trading price of our common stock and our capital needs we have no obligation to sell any shares under our atthemarket program 

in december 2018 we entered into a forward equity sales agreement to sell up to an aggregate of 1525 million shares of our common stock including shares issued through the exercise of underwriters’ options at an initial net price of 2860 per share after underwriting discounts and commissions the agreement has a one year term and expires on december 13 2019 the forward sale price that we expect to receive upon settlement of the agreement will be subject to adjustments for i the forward purchasers’ stock borrowing costs and ii certain fixed price reductions during the term of the agreement at december 31 2018  no shares have been issued under the forward equity sales agreement 

in december 2018 contemporaneous with the forward equity offering discussed above we completed a public offering of two million  shares of common stock at a net price of 2860  per share resulting in net proceeds of 57 million  

shelf registration 

we filed a prospectus with the sec as part of a registration statement on form s3 using an automatic shelf registration process our current shelf registration statement expires in may 2021 at which time we expect to file a new shelf registration statement under the “shelf” process we may sell any combination of the securities described in the prospectus through one or more offerings the securities described in the prospectus include common stock preferred stock depositary shares debt securities and warrants 

contractual obligations 

the following table summarizes our material contractual payment obligations and commitments at december 31 2018  in thousands 



 



offbalance sheet arrangements 

we own interests in certain unconsolidated joint ventures as described in note 8 to the consolidated financial statements except in limited circumstances our risk of loss is limited to our investment in the joint venture and any outstanding loans receivable in addition we have certain properties which serve as collateral for debt that is owed by a previous owner of certain of our facilities as described under note 11 to the consolidated financial statements our risk of loss for these certain properties is limited to the outstanding debt balance plus penalties if any we have no other material offbalance sheet arrangements that we expect would materially affect our liquidity and capital resources except those described above under “contractual obligations” 

inflation 

our leases often provide for either fixed increases in base rents or indexed escalators based on the consumer price index or other measures andor additional rent based on increases in the tenants’ operating revenues most of our mob leases require the tenant to pay a share of property operating costs such as real estate taxes insurance and utilities substantially all of our senior housing triplenet life science and remaining other leases require the tenant or operator to pay all of the property operating costs or reimburse us for all such costs we believe that inflationary increases in expenses will be offset in part by the tenant or operator expense reimbursements and contractual rent increases described above

critical accounting policies 

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us gaap requires our management to use judgment in the application of accounting policies including making estimates and assumptions we base estimates on the best information available to us at the time our experience and on various other assumptions believed to be reasonable under the circumstances these estimates affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods if our judgment or interpretation of the facts and circumstances relating to various transactions or other matters had been different it is possible that different accounting would have been applied resulting in a different presentation of our consolidated financial statements from time to time we reevaluate our estimates and assumptions in the event estimates or assumptions prove to be different from actual results adjustments are made in subsequent periods to reflect more current estimates and assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain for a more detailed discussion of our significant accounting policies see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements below is a discussion of accounting policies that we consider critical in that they may require complex judgment in their application or require estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain 

principles of consolidation 

the consolidated financial statements include the accounts of hcp inc our whollyowned subsidiaries and joint ventures that we control through voting rights or other means we consolidate investments in variable interest entities “vies” when we are the primary beneficiary of the vie a variable interest holder is considered to be the primary beneficiary of a vie if it has the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the entity’s economic performance and has the obligation to absorb losses of or the right to receive benefits from the entity that could potentially be significant to the vie 

we make judgments about which entities are vies based on an assessment of whether i the equity investment at risk is insufficient to finance that entity’s activities without additional subordinated financial support ii substantially all of an entity’s activities either involve or are conducted on behalf of an investor that has disproportionately few voting rights or iii the equity investors as a group lack any of the following a the power through voting or similar rights to direct the activities of an entity that most significantly impact the entity’s economic performance b the obligation to absorb the expected losses of an entity or c the right to receive the expected residual returns of an entity criterion iii above is generally applied to limited partnerships and similarly structured entities by assessing whether a simple majority of the limited partners hold substantive rights to participate in the significant decisions of the entity or have the ability to remove the decision maker or liquidate the entity without cause if neither of those criteria are met the entity is a vie 

we also make judgments with respect to our level of influence or control over an entity and whether we are or are not the primary beneficiary of a vie consideration of various factors includes but is not limited to 

 our ability to correctly assess our influence or control over an entity when determining the primary beneficiary of a vie affects the presentation of these entities in our consolidated financial statements when we perform a reassessment of the primary beneficiary at a date other than at inception of the vie our assumptions may be different and may result in the identification of a different primary beneficiary 

if we determine that we are the primary beneficiary of a vie our consolidated financial statements include the operating results of the vie rather than the results of our variable interest in the vie we require vies to provide us timely financial information and review the internal controls of vies to determine if we can rely on the financial information it provides if a vie has deficiencies in its internal controls over financial reporting or does not provide us with timely financial information it may adversely impact the quality andor timing of our financial reporting and our internal controls over financial reporting 

revenue recognition 

lease classification 

at the inception of a new lease arrangement including new leases that arise from amendments we assess the terms and conditions to determine the proper lease classification for leases entered into prior to january 1 2019 a lease arrangement is classified as an operating lease if none of the following criteria are met i transfer of ownership to the lessee prior to or shortly after the end of the lease term ii the lessee has a bargain purchase option during or at the end of the lease term iii the lease term is equal to 75 or more of the underlying property’s economic life or iv the present value of future minimum lease payments excluding executory costs is equal to 90 or more of the estimated fair value of the leased asset if one of the four criteria is met and the minimum lease payments are determined to be reasonably predictable and collectible the lease arrangement is generally accounted for as a dfl 

concurrent with our adoption of accounting standards update no 201602 leases “asu 201602” on january 1 2019 we will begin classifying a lease entered into subsequent to adoption as an operating lease if none of the following criteria are met i transfer of ownership to the lessee by the end of the lease term ii lessee has a purchase option during or at the end of the lease term that it is reasonably certain to exercise iii the lease term is for the major part of the remaining economic life of the underlying asset iv the present value of future minimum lease payments is equal to substantially all of the fair value of the underlying asset or v the underlying asset is of such a specialized nature that it is expected to have no alternative use to us at the end of the lease term 

if the assumptions utilized in the above classification assessments were different our lease classification for accounting purposes may have been different thus the timing and amount of our revenue recognized would have been impacted which may be material to our consolidated financial statements 

rental and related revenues 

we recognize rental revenue for operating leases on a straightline basis over the lease term when collectibility of all minimum lease payments is reasonably assured and the tenant has taken possession or controls the physical use of a leased asset if the lease provides for tenant improvements we determine whether the tenant improvements are owned by the tenant or us when we are the owner of the tenant improvements the tenant is not considered to have taken physical possession or have control of the leased asset until the tenant improvements are substantially complete when the tenant is the owner of the tenant improvements any tenant improvement allowance funded is treated as a lease incentive and amortized as a reduction of revenue over the lease term the determination of ownership of a tenant improvement is subject to significant judgment if our assessment of the owner of the tenant improvements was different the timing and amount of our revenue recognized would be impacted 

certain leases provide for additional rents that are contingent upon a percentage of the facility’s revenue in excess of specified base amounts or other thresholds such revenue is recognized when actual results reported by the tenant or estimates of tenant results exceed the base amount or other thresholds the recognition of additional rents requires us to make estimates of amounts owed and to a certain extent is dependent on the accuracy of the facility results reported to us our estimates may differ from actual results which could be material to our consolidated financial statements 

income from direct financing leases 

we use the direct finance method of accounting to record income from dfls for leases accounted for as dfls the net investment in the dfl represents receivables for the sum of future minimum lease payments receivable and the estimated residual values of the leased properties less the unamortized unearned income unearned income is deferred and amortized to income over the lease terms to provide a constant yield when collectibility of the lease payments is reasonably assured the determination of estimated useful lives and residual values are subject to significant judgment if these assessments were to change the timing and amount of our revenue recognized would be impacted 

interest income 

loans receivable are classified as heldforinvestment based on management’s intent and ability to hold the loans for the foreseeable future or to maturity we recognize interest income on loans including the amortization of discounts and premiums using the interest method applied on a loanbyloan basis when collectibility of the future payments is reasonably assured premiums discounts and related costs are recognized as yield adjustments over the term of the related loans if management determines that certain loans should no longer be classified as heldforinvestment the timing and amount of our interest income recognized would be impacted 

allowance for doubtful accounts 

we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts including an allowance for operating lease straightline rent receivables for estimated losses resulting from tenant defaults or the inability of tenants to make contractual rent and tenant recovery payments we monitor the liquidity and creditworthiness of our tenants and operators on a continuous basis this evaluation considers industry and economic conditions property performance credit enhancements and other factors for straightline rent receivable amounts our assessment is based on income recoverable over the term of the lease we exercise judgment in establishing allowances and consider payment history and current credit status in developing these estimates these estimates may differ from actual results which could be material to our consolidated financial statements 

loans receivable and dfls collectively “finance receivables” are reviewed and assigned an internal rating of performing watch list or workout finance receivables that are deemed performing meet all present contractual obligations and collection and timing of all amounts owed is reasonably assured watch list finance receivables are defined as finance receivables that do not meet the definition of performing or workout workout finance receivables are defined as finance receivables in which we have determined based on current information and events that i it is probable we will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the agreement ii the tenant operator or borrower is delinquent on making payments under the contractual terms of the agreement and iii we have commenced action or anticipate pursuing action in the near term to seek recovery of our investment 

finance receivables are placed on nonaccrual status when management determines that the collectibility of contractual amounts is not reasonably assured the asset will have an internal rating of either watch list or workout further we perform a credit analysis to support the tenant’s operator’s borrower’s andor guarantor’s repayment capacity and the underlying collateral values we use the cash basis method of accounting for finance receivables placed on nonaccrual status unless one of the following conditions exist whereby we utilize the cost recovery method of accounting i if we determine that it is probable that we will only recover the recorded investment in the finance receivable net of associated allowances or chargeoffs if any or ii we cannot reasonably estimate the amount of an impaired finance receivable for cash basis method of accounting we apply payments received excluding principal paydowns to interest income so long as that amount does not exceed the amount that would have been earned under the original contractual terms for cost recovery method of accounting any payment received is applied to reduce the recorded investment generally we return a finance receivable to accrual status when all delinquent payments become current under the terms of the loan or lease agreements and collectibility of the remaining contractual loan or lease payments is reasonably assured 

allowances are established for finance receivables on an individual basis utilizing an estimate of probable losses if they are determined to be impaired finance receivables are impaired when it is deemed probable that we will be unable to collect all amounts due in accordance with the contractual terms of the loan or lease an allowance is based upon our assessment of the lessee’s or borrower’s overall financial condition economic resources payment record the prospects for support from any financially responsible guarantors and if appropriate the net realizable value of any collateral these estimates consider all available evidence including the expected future cash flows discounted at the finance receivable’s effective interest rate fair value of collateral general economic conditions and trends historical and industry loss experience and other relevant factors as appropriate should a finance receivable be deemed partially or wholly uncollectible the uncollectible balance is charged off against the allowance in the period in which the uncollectible determination has been made 

real estate 

we make estimates as part of our process for allocating a purchase price to the various identifiable assets of an acquisition based upon the relative fair value of each asset the most significant components of our allocations are typically buildings asifvacant land and inplace leases in the case of allocating fair value to buildings and intangibles our fair value estimates will affect the amount of depreciation and amortization we record over the estimated useful life of each asset acquired in the case of allocating fair value to inplace leases we make our best estimates based on our evaluation of the specific characteristics of each tenant’s lease factors considered include estimates of carrying costs during hypothetical expected leaseup periods market conditions and costs to execute similar leases our assumptions affect the amount of future revenue andor depreciation and amortization expense that we will recognize over the remaining useful life for the acquired inplace leases 

a variety of costs are incurred in the development and leasing of properties after determination is made to capitalize a cost it is allocated to the specific component of a project that is benefited determination of when a development project is substantially complete and capitalization must cease involves a degree of judgment the costs of land and buildings under development include specifically identifiable costs the capitalized costs include preconstruction costs essential to the development of the property development costs construction costs interest costs real estate taxes and other costs incurred during the period of development 

we consider a construction project to be considered substantially complete and available for occupancy and cease capitalization of costs upon the completion of the related tenant improvements 

impairment of longlived assets 

we assess the carrying value of our real estate assets and related intangibles “real estate assets” when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable but at least annually recoverability of real estate assets is measured by comparing the carrying amount of the real estate assets to the respective estimated future undiscounted cash flows the expected future undiscounted cash flows reflect external market factors and are probabilityweighted to reflect multiple possible cashflow scenarios including selling the assets at various points in the future additionally the estimated future undiscounted cash flows are calculated utilizing the lowest level of identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities in order to review our real estate assets for recoverability we make assumptions regarding external market conditions as well as our intent with respect to holding or disposing of the asset if our analysis indicates that the carrying value of the real estate assets is not recoverable on an undiscounted cash flow basis we recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the real estate asset 

the determination of the fair value of real estate assets involves significant judgment this judgment is based on our analysis and estimates of fair value of real estate assets future operating results and resulting cash flows and the period over which we will hold each real estate asset our ability to accurately predict future operating results and resulting cash flows and estimate fair values impacts the timing and recognition of impairments while we believe our assumptions are reasonable changes in these assumptions may have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 

investments in unconsolidated joint ventures 

the initial carrying value of investments in unconsolidated joint ventures is based on the amount paid to purchase the joint venture interest or the carrying value of the assets prior to the sale or contribution of the interests to the joint venture we evaluate our equity method investments for impairment by first reviewing for indicators of impairment based upon the performance of the underlying real estate assets held by the joint venture if an equitymethod investment shows indicators of impairment we compare the fair value of the investment to the carrying value if we determine there is a decline in the fair value of our investment in an unconsolidated joint venture below its carrying value and it is otherthantemporary an impairment charge is recorded the determination of the fair value of investments in unconsolidated joint ventures and as to whether a deficiency in fair value is otherthantemporary involves significant judgment our estimates consider all available evidence including as appropriate the present value of the expected future cash flows discounted at market rates general economic conditions and trends severity and duration of a fair value deficiency and other relevant factors capitalization rates discount rates and credit spreads utilized in our valuation models are based upon rates that we believe to be within a reasonable range of current market rates for the respective investments while we believe our assumptions are reasonable changes in these assumptions may have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 

income taxes 

as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements significant management judgment is required to evaluate our compliance with reit requirements our determinations are based on interpretation of tax laws and our conclusions may have an impact on the income tax expense recognized adjustments to income tax expense may be required as a result of i audits conducted by federal state and local tax authorities ii our ability to qualify as a reit iii the potential for builtin gain recognition and iv changes in tax laws adjustments required in any given period are included within the income tax provision

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

tableend we are exposed to various market risks including the potential loss arising from adverse changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates specifically gbp we use derivative and other financial instruments in the normal course of business to mitigate interest rate and foreign currency risk we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes derivatives are recorded on the consolidated balance sheets at fair value see note 22 to the consolidated financial statements 

to illustrate the effect of movements in the interest rate markets we performed a market sensitivity analysis on our hedging instruments we applied various basis point spreads to the underlying interest rate curves of the hedging portfolio in order to determine the change in fair value assuming a one percentage point change in the underlying interest rate curve the estimated change in fair value of each of the underlying hedging instruments would not exceed 1 million  

interest rate risk 

at december 31 2018  we are exposed to market risks related to fluctuations in interest rates primarily on variable rate debt as of december 31 2018  43 million  of our variablerate debt was hedged by interest rate swap transactions the interest rate swaps are designated as cash flow hedges with the objective of managing the exposure to interest rate risk by converting the interest rates on our variablerate debt to fixed interest rates 

interest rate fluctuations will generally not affect our future earnings or cash flows on our fixed rate debt and assets until their maturity or earlier prepayment and refinancing if interest rates have risen at the time we seek to refinance our fixed rate debt whether at maturity or otherwise our future earnings and cash flows could be adversely affected by additional borrowing costs conversely lower interest rates at the time of refinancing may reduce our overall borrowing costs however interest rate changes will affect the fair value of our fixed rate instruments at december 31 2018  a one percentage point increase or decrease in interest rates would change the fair value of our fixed rate debt by approximately 252 million  and 272 million  respectively and would not materially impact earnings or cash flows additionally a one percentage point increase or decrease in interest rates would change the fair value of our fixed rate debt investments by approximately 3 million  and less than 1 million  respectively and would not materially impact earnings or cash flows conversely changes in interest rates on variable rate debt and investments would change our future earnings and cash flows but not materially impact the fair value of those instruments assuming a one percentage point change in the interest rate related to our variablerate debt and variablerate investments and assuming no other changes in the outstanding balance as of december 31 2018  our annual interest expense and interest income would change by approximately 1 million  and 1 million  respectively 

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

at december 31 2018  our exposure to foreign currencies primarily relates to uk investments in leased real estate loans receivable and related gbp denominated cash flows our foreign currency exposure is partially mitigated through the use of gbpdenominated borrowings based solely on our operating results for the year ended december 31 2018  including the impact of existing hedging arrangements if the value of the gbp relative to the us dollar were to increase or decrease by 10 compared to the average exchange rate during the year ended december 31 2018  the increase or decrease to our cash flows would not be material 

market risk 

we have investments in marketable debt securities classified as heldtomaturity because we have the positive intent and ability to hold the securities to maturity heldtomaturity securities are recorded at amortized cost and adjusted for the amortization of premiums and discounts through maturity we consider a variety of factors in evaluating an otherthantemporary decline in value such as the length of time and the extent to which the market value has been less than our current adjusted carrying value the issuer’s financial condition capital strength and nearterm prospects any recent events specific to that issuer and economic conditions of its industry and our investment horizon in relationship to an anticipated nearterm recovery in the market value if any at december 31 2018  both the fair value and carrying value of marketable debt securities were 19 million

for a description of our significant activities during 2017  see item 7 in this report 

business strategy 

we invest and manage our real estate portfolio for the longterm to maximize the benefit to our stockholders and support the growth of our dividends the core elements of our strategy are i to acquire develop lease own and manage a diversified portfolio of quality healthcare properties across multiple geographic locations and business segments including senior housing medical office and life science among others ii to align ourselves with leading healthcare companies operators and service providers which over the longterm should result in higher relative rental rates net operating cash flows and appreciation of property values and iii to maintain an investment grade balance sheet with adequate liquidity and longterm fixed rate debt financing with staggered maturities which supports the longerterm nature of our investments while reducing our exposure to interest rate volatility and refinancing risk at any point in the interest rate or credit cycles  

internal growth strategies 

we believe our real estate portfolio holds the potential for increased future cash flows as it is wellmaintained and in desirable locations our strategy for maximizing the benefits from these opportunities is to i work with new or existing tenants and operators to address their space and capital needs and ii provide highquality property management services in order to motivate tenants to renew expand or relocate into our properties 

we expect to continue our internal growth as a result of our ability to 

 investment strategies 

the delivery of healthcare services requires real estate and as a result tenants and operators depend on real estate in part to maintain and grow their businesses we believe that the healthcare real estate market provides investment opportunities due to the i compelling longterm demographics driving the demand for healthcare services ii specialized nature of healthcare real estate investing and iii ongoing consolidation of the fragmented healthcare real estate sector 

while we emphasize healthcare real estate ownership we may also provide real estate secured financing to or invest in equity or debt securities of healthcare operators or other entities engaged in healthcare real estate ownership we may also acquire all or substantially all of the securities or assets of other reits operating companies or similar entities where such investments would be consistent with our investment strategies we may coinvest alongside institutional or development investors through partnerships or limited liability companies 

we monitor but do not limit our investments based on the percentage of our total assets that may be invested in any one property type investment vehicle or geographic location the number of properties that may be leased to a single tenant or operator or loans that may be made to a single borrower in allocating capital we target opportunities with the most attractive riskreward profile for our portfolio as a whole we may take additional measures to mitigate risk including diversifying our investments by sector geography tenant or operator structuring transactions as master leases requiring tenant or operator insurance and indemnifications and obtaining credit enhancements in the form of guarantees letters of credit or security deposits 

we believe we are wellpositioned to achieve external growth through acquisitions financing and development other factors that contribute to our competitive position include 

 financing strategies 

our reit qualification requires us to distribute at least 90 of our reit taxable income excluding net capital gains therefore we don’t retain a significant amount of capital as a result we regularly access the public equity and debt markets to raise the funds necessary to finance acquisitions and debt investments develop and redevelop properties and refinance maturing debt 

we may finance acquisitions and other investments through the following vehicles 

 we maintain a disciplined balance sheet by actively managing our debt to equity levels and maintaining multiple sources of liquidity our debt obligations are primarily longterm fixed rate with staggered maturities 

we finance our investments based on our evaluation of available sources of funding for shortterm purposes we may utilize our revolving line of credit facility or arrange for other shortterm borrowings from banks or other sources we arrange for longerterm financing by offering debt and equity securities placing mortgage debt and obtaining capital from institutional lenders and joint venture partners 

segments 

the following table summarizes our revenues by segment dollars in thousands 



senior housing triplenet and shop  our senior housing facilities are managed utilizing triplenet leases and ridea structures which are permitted by the housing and economic recovery act of 2008 commonly referred to as “ridea” and include independent living facilities “ilfs” assisted living facilities “alfs” and memory care facilities “mcfs” and continuing care retirement communities ccrcs which cater to different segments of the elderly population based upon their personal needs services provided by our tenants or operators in these facilities are primarily paid for by the residents directly or through private insurance and are less reliant on government reimbursement programs such as medicare and medicaid 

we have entered into longterm agreements with operators to manage properties under a ridea structure under the provisions of ridea a reit may lease a “qualified healthcare property” on an arm’s length basis to a taxable reit subsidiary “trs” if the property is managed on behalf of such subsidiary by a person who qualifies as an “eligible independent contractor” ridea structures allow us to own the risks and rewards of the operations of healthcare facilities as compared to leasing the property for contractual triplenet rents in a tax efficient manner we view ridea as a structure primarily to be used on properties that present attractive valuation entry points andor growth profiles by i transitioning the asset to a new operator that can bring scale operating efficiencies andor ancillary services or ii investing capital to reposition the asset our operators provide comprehensive facility management and accounting services for a majority of our senior housing ridea properties for which we pay annual management fees pursuant to the aforementioned agreements   most of the management agreements have terms ranging from 10 to 15 years with three to four 5year renewals the base management fees are 45 to 50 of gross revenues as defined generated by the ridea facilities in addition there are incentive management fees payable to our operators if operating results of the ridea properties exceed preestablished ebitdar defined as earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization and rent thresholds 

our senior housing property types under both triplenet leases and ridea structures are further described below 



resident’s lifetime which offer a continuum of housing services and healthcare on one campus or site ccrcs are appealing as they allow residents to “age in place” ccrcs typically require the individual to be in relatively good health and independent upon entry 

the following table provides information about our senior housing triplenet tenant concentration for the year ended december 31 2017  



 

 as of december 31 2017  brookdale operated in our shop segment approximately 13  of our real estate investments based on total assets our concentration with respect to brookdale as an operator in our shop segment is expected to decrease with the completion of the transaction with brookdale see note 3 in the consolidated financial statements for additional information and the sale of our remaining 40  ownership interest in ridea ii see note 5 in the consolidated financial statements for additional information because operators manage our facilities in exchange for the receipt of a management fee we are not directly exposed to the credit risk of the operators in the same manner or to the same extent as our triplenet tenants however adverse developments in their business and affairs or financial condition could impair their ability to efficiently and effectively manage our facilities 

life science   these properties contain laboratory and office space primarily for biotechnology medical device and pharmaceutical companies scientific research institutions government agencies and other organizations involved in the life science industry while these properties have characteristics similar to commercial office buildings they generally contain more advanced electrical mechanical and heating ventilating and air conditioning “hvac” systems the facilities generally have specialty equipment including emergency generators fume hoods lab bench tops and related amenities in many instances life science tenants make significant investments to improve their leased space in addition to landlord improvements to accommodate biology chemistry or medical device research initiatives 

life science properties are primarily configured in business park or campus settings and include multiple buildings the business park and campus settings allow us the opportunity to provide flexible contiguousadjacent expansion to accommodate the growth of existing tenants our properties are located in wellestablished geographical markets known for scientific research and drug discovery including san francisco 63 and san diego 25 california boston massachusetts and durham north carolina based on square feet at december 31 2017  93  of our life science properties were triplenet leased based on leased square feet 

the following table provides information about our life science tenant concentration for the year ended december 31 2017  



medical office   medical office buildings “mobs” typically contain physicians’ offices and examination rooms and may also include pharmacies hospital ancillary service space and outpatient services such as diagnostic centers rehabilitation clinics and daysurgery operating rooms while these facilities are similar to commercial office buildings they require additional plumbing electrical and mechanical systems to accommodate multiple exam rooms that may require sinks in every room and special equipment such as xray machines in addition mobs are often built to accommodate higher structural loads for certain equipment and may contain vaults or other specialized construction our mobs are typically multitenant properties leased to healthcare providers hospitals and physician practices with approximately 81  of our mobs based on square feet located on hospital campuses and 94  affiliated with hospital systems occasionally we invest in mobs located on hospital campuses which may be subject to ground leases at december 31 2017  approximately 54  of our medical office buildings were net leased based on leased square feet with the remaining leased under gross or modified gross leases 

the following table provides information about our medical office tenant concentration for the year ended december 31 2017  



 

 other nonreportable segments   at december 31 2017  we had interests in 14  hospitals 61  care homes in the united kingdom “uk” one  postacuteskilled nursing facilities “snf” and debt investments additionally we had interests in 72 senior housing facilities four life science facilities three mobs and three snfs owned and operated by our unconsolidated joint ventures services provided by our tenants and operators in hospitals are paid for by private sources thirdparty payors eg insurance and hmos or through medicare and medicaid programs our hospital property types include acute care longterm acute care and specialty and rehabilitation hospitals care homes offer personal care services such as lodging meal services housekeeping and laundry services medication management and assistance with adl care homes are registered to provide different levels of services ranging from personal care to nursing care some homes can be further registered for a specific care need such as dementia or terminal illness snfs offer restorative rehabilitative and custodial nursing care for people following a hospital stay or not requiring the more extensive and complex treatment available at hospitals all of our care homes in the uk hospitals and snfs are triplenet leased 

competition 

investing in real estate serving the healthcare industry is highly competitive we face competition from other reits investment companies pension funds private equity investors sovereign funds healthcare operators lenders developers and other institutional investors some of whom may have greater flexibility eg nonreit competitors resources and lower costs of capital than we do increased competition makes it more challenging for us to identify and successfully capitalize on opportunities that meet our objectives our ability to compete may also be impacted by global national and local economic trends availability of investment alternatives availability and cost of capital construction and renovation costs existing laws and regulations new legislation and population trends 

income from our investments depends on our tenants’ and operators’ ability to compete with other companies on multiple levels including the quality of care provided reputation success of product or drug development the physical appearance of a facility price and range of services offered alternatives for healthcare delivery the supply of competing properties physicians staff referral sources location the size and demographics of the population in surrounding areas and the financial condition of our tenants and operators for a discussion of the risks associated with competitive conditions affecting our business see “item 1a risk factors” in this report 

government regulation licensing and enforcement 

overview 

our healthcare facility operators which include our trss when we use a ridea structure and tenants are typically subject to extensive and complex federal state and local healthcare laws and regulations relating to quality of care licensure and certificate of need government reimbursement fraud and abuse practices and similar laws governing the operation of healthcare facilities and we expect that the healthcare industry in general will continue to face increased regulation and pressure in the areas of fraud waste and abuse cost control healthcare management and provision of services among others these regulations are wide ranging and can subject our tenants and operators to civil criminal and administrative sanctions affected tenants and operators may find it increasingly difficult to comply with this complex and evolving regulatory environment because of a relative lack of guidance in many areas as certain of our healthcare properties are subject to oversight from several government agencies and the laws may vary from one jurisdiction to another changes in laws regulations reimbursement enforcement activity and regulatory noncompliance by our tenants and operators can all have a significant effect on their operations and financial condition which in turn may adversely impact us as detailed below and set forth under “item 1a risk factors” in this report 

the following is a discussion of certain laws and regulations generally applicable to our operators and in certain cases to us 

fraud and abuse enforcement 

there are various extremely complex us federal and state laws and regulations and in relation to our facilities located in the uk national laws and regulations of england scotland northern ireland and wales governing healthcare providers’ relationships and arrangements and prohibiting fraudulent and abusive practices by such providers these laws include i us federal and state false claims acts and uk antifraud legislation and regulation which among other things prohibit providers from filing false claims or making false statements to receive payment from medicare medicaid or other us federal or state or uk healthcare programs ii us federal and state antikickback and feesplitting statutes including the medicare and medicaid antikickback statute which prohibit or restrict the payment or receipt of remuneration to induce referrals or recommendations of healthcare items or services and uk legislation and regulations on financial inducements and vested interests iii us federal and state physician selfreferral laws commonly referred to as the “stark law” which generally prohibit referrals by physicians to entities with which the physician or an immediate family member has a financial relationship and iv the federal civil monetary penalties law which prohibits among other things the knowing presentation of a false or fraudulent claim for certain healthcare services violations of us and uk healthcare fraud and abuse laws carry civil criminal and administrative sanctions including punitive sanctions monetary penalties imprisonment denial of medicare and medicaid reimbursement and potential exclusion from medicare medicaid or other federal or state healthcare programs these laws are enforced by a variety of federal state and local agencies and in the us can also be enforced by private litigants through among other things federal and state false claims acts which allow private litigants to bring qui tam  or “whistleblower” actions many of our tenants and operators are subject to these laws and may become the subject of governmental enforcement actions or whistleblower actions if they fail to comply with applicable laws additionally beginning in november 2019 the licensed operators of our us longterm care facilities will be required to have compliance and ethics programs that meet the requirements of federal regulations we have begun the process of developing and implementing such programs 

laws and regulations governing privacy and security 

there are various us federal and state and uk privacy laws and regulations including the privacy and security rules contained in the health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 commonly referred to as “hipaa” and the uk data protection act 1998 which provide for the privacy and security of personal health information an increasing focus of the u s federal trade commission’s “ftc’s” consumer protection regulation is the impact of technological change on protection of consumer privacy the ftc has taken enforcement action against companies that do not abide by their representations to consumers regarding electronic security and privacy to the extent we or our affiliated operating entities are a covered entity or business associate under hipaa and the health information technology for economic and clinical health act the “hitech act” compliance with those requirements would require us to among other things conduct a risk analysis implement a risk management plan implement policies and procedures and conduct employee training in most cases we are dependent on our tenants and management companies to fulfill our compliance obligations because of the far reaching nature of these laws there can be no assurance that we would not be required to alter one or more of our systems and data security procedures to be in compliance with these laws our failure to protect health information could subject us to civil or criminal liability and adverse publicity and could harm our business and impair our ability to attract new customers and residents we may be required to notify individuals as well as government agencies and the media if we experience a data breach

sources of revenue for some of our tenants and operators include among others governmental healthcare programs such as the federal medicare programs and state medicaid programs and in the uk the national health service “nhs” and local authority funding and nongovernmental thirdparty payors such as insurance carriers and hmos as federal and state governments focus on healthcare reform initiatives and as the federal government and many states face significant current and future budget deficits efforts to reduce costs by these payors will likely continue which may result in reduced or slower growth in reimbursement for certain services provided by some of our tenants and operators similarly in the uk the nhs and the local authorities are undertaking efforts to reduce costs which may result in reduced or slower growth in reimbursement for certain services provided by our uk tenants and operators additionally new and evolving payor and provider programs in the us including but not limited to medicare advantage dual eligible accountable care organizations “aco” and bundled payments could adversely impact our tenants’ and operators’ liquidity financial condition or results of operations 

healthcare licensure and certificate of need 

certain healthcare facilities in our portfolio including our facilities located in the uk are subject to extensive national federal state and local licensure certification and inspection laws and regulations a healthcare facility’s failure to comply with these laws and regulations could result in a revocation suspension or nonrenewal of the facility’s license which could adversely affect the facility’s operations and ability to bill for items and services provided at the facility in addition various licenses and permits are required to handle controlled substances including narcotics operate pharmacies handle radioactive materials and operate equipment many states in the us require certain healthcare providers to obtain a certificate of need which requires prior approval for the construction expansion or closure of certain healthcare facilities the approval process related to state certificate of need laws may impact the ability of some of our tenants and operators to expand or change their businesses 

life science facilities 

while our life science tenants include some wellestablished companies other tenants are less established and in some cases may not yet have a product approved by the food and drug administration or other regulatory authorities for commercial sale creating a new pharmaceutical product or medical device requires substantial investments of time and capital in part because of the extensive regulation of the healthcare industry it also entails considerable risk of failure in demonstrating that the product is safe and effective and in gaining regulatory approval and market acceptance 

senior housing entrance fee communities 

certain of our senior housing facilities primarily the ccrcs in our unconsolidated joint ventures are operated as entrance fee communities generally an entrance fee is an upfront fee or consideration paid by a resident a portion of which may be refundable in exchange for some form of longterm benefit typically consisting of a right to receive certain personal or health care services some of the entrance fee communities are subject to significant state regulatory oversight including for example oversight of each facility’s financial condition establishment and monitoring of reserve requirements and other financial restrictions the right of residents to cancel their contracts within a specified period of time the right of residents to receive a refund of their entrance fees lien rights in favor of the residents restrictions on change of ownership and similar matters 

americans with disabilities act the “ada” 

our properties must comply with the ada and any similar state or local laws to the extent that such properties are “public accommodations” as defined in those statutes the ada may require removal of barriers to access by persons with disabilities in certain public areas of our properties where such removal is readily achievable to date we have not received any notices of noncompliance with the ada that have caused us to incur substantial capital expenditures to address ada concerns should barriers to access by persons with disabilities be discovered at any of our properties we may be directly or indirectly responsible for additional costs that may be required to make facilities adacompliant noncompliance with the ada could result in the imposition of fines or an award of damages to private litigants the obligation to make readily achievable accommodations pursuant to the ada is an ongoing one and we continue to assess our properties and make modifications as appropriate in this respect 

environmental matters 

a wide variety of federal state and local environmental and occupational health and safety laws and regulations affect healthcare facility operations these complex federal and state statutes and their enforcement involve a myriad of regulations many of which involve strict liability on the part of the potential offender some of these federal and state statutes may directly impact us under various federal state and local environmental laws ordinances and regulations an owner of real property or a secured lender such as us may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of hazardous or toxic substances at under or disposed of in connection with such property as well as other potential costs relating to hazardous or toxic substances including government fines and damages for injuries to persons and adjacent property the cost of any required remediation removal fines or personal or property damages and any related liability therefore could exceed or impair the value of the property andor the assets in addition the presence of such substances or the failure to properly dispose of or remediate such substances may adversely affect the value of such property and the owner’s ability to sell or rent such property or to borrow using such property as collateral which in turn could reduce our earnings for a description of the risks associated with environmental matters see “item 1a risk factors” in this report 

insurance 

we obtain various types of insurance to mitigate the impact of property business interruption liability flood windstorm earthquake environmental and terrorism related losses we attempt to obtain appropriate policy terms conditions limits and deductibles considering the relative risk of loss the cost of such coverage and current industry practice there are however certain types of extraordinary losses such as those due to acts of war or other events that may be either uninsurable or not economically 

insurable in addition we have a large number of properties that are exposed to earthquake flood and windstorm occurrences which carry higher deductibles 

we maintain property insurance for all of our properties primary for our shop life science and medical office segments tenants under triplenet leases primarily in our senior housing triplenet segment are required to provide primary property business interruption and liability insurance we maintain separate general and professional liability insurance for our shop facilities additionally our corporate general liability insurance program also extends coverage for all of our properties beyond the aforementioned we periodically review whether we or our ridea operators will bear responsibility for maintaining the required insurance coverage for the applicable shop properties but the costs of such insurance are facility expenses paid from the revenues of those properties regardless of who maintains the insurance 

see note 16 to the consolidated financial statements for further information relating to casualtyrelated losses and recoveries incurred as a result of the hurricanes in the third quarter of 2017 

we also maintain directors and officers liability insurance which provides protection for claims against our directors and officers arising from their responsibilities as directors and officers such insurance also extends to us in certain situations 

sustainability 

we believe that sustainability initiatives are a vital part of corporate responsibility which supports our primary goal of increasing stockholder value through profitable growth we continue to advance our commitment to sustainability with a focus on achieving goals in each of the environmental social and governance “esg” dimensions of sustainability 

our environmental management programs strive to capture cost efficiencies that ultimately benefit our investors tenants operators employees and other stakeholders while providing a positive impact on the communities in which we operate our social responsibility team leads our local philanthropic and volunteer activities and our transparent corporate governance initiatives incorporate sustainability as a critical component to achieving our business objectives and properly managing risks 

our 2017 sustainability achievements include being named an energy star partner of the year and constituency in the ftse4good index series for the sixth consecutive year we also earned the green star designation from the global real estate sustainability benchmark or gresb and were named to the leadership band by cdp for outstanding esg performance we achieved constituency in the north america dow jones sustainability index “djsi” for the fifth consecutive year as well as the world djsi for the third time additionally we were included in the sustainability yearbook 2018 a listing of the world’s most sustainable companies the list is compiled according to the results of robecosam’s annual corporate sustainability assessment which also determines constituency for the dow jones sustainability index “djsi” series for additional information regarding our esg sustainability initiatives and our approach to climate change please visit our website at wwwhcpicomsustainability

 item 1a 

risk factors   

tableend the section below discusses the most significant risk factors that may materially adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

as set forth below we believe that the risks we face generally fall into the following categories 



risks related to our business and operations 

we depend on one tenant and operator brookdale for a significant percentage of our revenues and net operating income continuing adverse developments including operational challenges in brookdale’s business and affairs or financial condition would likely have a materially adverse effect on us 

we manage our facilities utilizing ridea and triplenet lease structures as of december 31 2017  brookdale leased or managed 78  senior housing facilities that we own and 62 shop facilities owned by our unconsolidated joint venture pursuant to longterm leases and management agreements these properties represent a substantial portion of our portfolio revenues and operating income 

properties managed by brookdale in our shop segment as of december 31 2017  accounted for 13  of our total assets although we have various rights as the property owner under our management agreements we rely on brookdale’s personnel expertise technical resources and information systems proprietary information good faith and judgment to manage our related senior living operations efficiently and effectively we also rely on brookdale to set appropriate resident fees manage occupancy provide accurate and complete propertylevel financial results for these senior housing communities in a timely manner and otherwise operate them in compliance with the terms of our management agreements and all applicable laws and regulations 

properties leased by brookdale accounted for 8  of our revenues for the year ended december 31 2017 in its capacity as a triplenet tenant we depend on brookdale to pay all insurance tax utilities maintenance and repair expenses in connection with the leased properties brookdale may not have sufficient assets income and access to financing to enable it to satisfy its obligations to us and any failure inability or unwillingness by brookdale to do so would have a material adverse effect on us in addition we depend on brookdale’s adequate maintenance and repair of the properties to remain competitive and attract and retain patients and residents adverse developments in brookdale’s business and related declining rent coverage ratios have increased its credit risk if these adverse developments result in prolonged inadequate property maintenance or improvements or impair brookdale’s access to capital necessary for maintenance or improvements it would likely lead to a significant reduction in occupancy rates and market rents and have a materially adverse effect on us 

brookdale has experienced significant challenges in recent years including poor operational performance ongoing class action litigation stockholder activism and portfolio restructuring execution among others brookdale has been adversely affected by increased competition that has negatively impacted occupancy rates and in certain cases brookdale has offered additional discounts and incentives to residents brookdale as well as our other operators have also experienced labor expense pressure and increased labor turnover additionally brookdale has announced that it is considering corporate strategic alternatives brookdale’s operational legal and financial challenges and its pursuit of strategic alternatives could significantly divert management’s attention increase employee turnover and impair its ability to manage our properties or its operations efficiently and effectively these challenges and any adverse developments in brookdale’s business affairs and financial results could result in among other adverse events declining operational and financial performance of our properties acceleration of brookdale’s indebtedness impairment of its continued access to capital the enforcement of default remedies by its counterparties or the commencement of insolvency proceedings by or against it under the us bankruptcy code 

in addition brookdale depends on private sources for its revenues and the ability of its patients and residents to pay its fees for example costs associated with independent and assisted living services are not generally reimbursable under governmental reimbursement programs such as medicare and medicaid accordingly brookdale depends on attracting seniors with appropriate levels of income and assets which may be affected by many factors including prevailing economic and market trends consumer confidence and demographics consequently if brookdale fails to effectively conduct its operations or to maintain and improve our properties it would adversely affect its business reputation and its ability to attract and retain patients and residents in our properties which would have a materially adverse effect on its and our business results of operations and financial condition 

brookdale also relies on reimbursements from governmental programs for a portion of its revenues changes in reimbursement policies and other governmental regulation such as potential changes to or repeal of the patient protection and affordable care act along with the health care and education reconciliation act of 2010 the “affordable care act” that may result from actions by congress or executive orders may result in reductions in brookdale’s revenues operations and cash flows and affect its ability to meet its obligations to us for a further discussion of the legislation and regulation that are applicable to us and our tenants operators and borrowers see “the requirements of or changes to governmental reimbursement programs such as medicare or medicaid may adversely affect our tenants’ operators’ and borrowers’ ability to meet their financial and other contractual obligations to us” while brookdale generally has also agreed to indemnify us for various claims litigation and liabilities arising in connection with its business it may have insufficient assets income access to financing andor insurance coverage to enable them to satisfy its indemnification obligations 

we are currently in the process of reducing our exposure to brookdale through asset sales and transitions to other operators see “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations2017 transaction overviewmaster transactions and cooperation agreement with brookdale” for more information however we may not be able to sell or transition assets managed or leased by brookdale according to our plans or within our anticipated timeframe in addition the sale and transition process may divert brookdale’s attention from the performance of the properties we are selling or transitioning or from our properties brookdale will continue to manage or lease from us following the contemplated transactions this could result in further operational challenges andor declining financial performance of our properties during or after the transition period the inability unwillingness or other failure of brookdale to pursue the optimal performance of our properties or to meet its obligations to us under its leases and management agreements could materially reduce our cash flow net operating income and results of operations and have other materially adverse effects on our business results of operations and financial condition 

the bankruptcy insolvency or financial deterioration of one or more of our major tenants operators or borrowers may materially adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

we lease our properties directly to operators in most cases and in certain other cases we lease to third party tenants who enter into longterm management agreements with operators to manage the properties we are also a direct or indirect lender to various tenants and operators and separately provide loans to certain third parties we have very limited control over the success or failure of our tenants’ operators’ and borrowers’ businesses any of our tenants or operators may experience a downturn in their business that materially weakens their financial condition as a result they may fail to make payments when due for example one of our borrowers tandem health care “tandem” has failed to make its required interest payments to us since november 10 2017 which resulted in an event of default and adversely affected our revenues although we generally have arrangements and other agreements that give us the right under specified circumstances to terminate a lease evict a tenant or operator or demand immediate repayment of outstanding loan amounts or other obligations to us we may determine not to do so if we believe that enforcement of our rights would be more detrimental to our business than seeking alternative approaches 

a downturn in any of our tenants’ operators’ or borrowers’ businesses could ultimately lead to bankruptcy if it is unable to timely resolve the underlying causes which may be largely outside of its control bankruptcy and insolvency laws afford certain rights to a party that has filed for bankruptcy or reorganization that may render certain of these remedies unenforceable or at the least delay our ability to pursue such remedies and realize any recoveries in connection therewith for example we cannot evict a tenant or operator solely because of its bankruptcy filing 

a debtor has the right to assume or to assume and assign to a third party or to reject its executory contracts and unexpired leases in a bankruptcy proceeding if a debtor were to reject its leases with us obligations under such rejected leases would cease the claim against the rejecting debtor would be an unsecured claim which would be limited by the statutory cap set forth in the us bankruptcy code this statutory cap may be substantially less than the remaining rent actually owed under the lease in addition a debtor may also assert in bankruptcy proceedings that leases should be recharacterized as financing agreements which could result in our being deemed a lender instead of a landlord a lender’s rights and remedies as compared to a landlord’s generally are materially less favorable and our rights as a lender may be subordinated to other creditors’ rights 

furthermore the automatic stay provisions of the us bankruptcy code would preclude us from enforcing our remedies unless we first obtain relief from the court having jurisdiction over the bankruptcy case this would effectively limit or delay our ability to collect unpaid rent or interest payments and we may ultimately not receive any payment at all in addition we would likely be required to fund certain expenses and obligations eg real estate taxes insurance debt costs and maintenance expenses to preserve the value of our properties avoid the imposition of liens on our properties or transition our properties to a new tenant operator or manager additionally we lease many of our facilities to healthcare providers who provide longterm custodial care to the elderly evicting these operators for failure to pay rent while the facility is occupied may involve specific procedural or regulatory requirements and may not be successful even if eviction is possible we may determine not to do so due to reputational or other risks 

bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings typically also result in increased costs to the operator significant management distraction and performance declines if we are unable to transition affected properties they would likely experience prolonged operational disruption leading to lower occupancy rates and further depressed revenues publicity about the operator’s financial condition and insolvency proceeds may also negatively impact their and our reputations decreasing customer demand and revenues any or all of these risks could have a material adverse effect on our revenues results of operations and cash flows these risks would be magnified where we lease multiple properties to a single operator under a master lease as an operator failure or default under a master lease would expose us to these risks across multiple properties 

additionally the financial weakness or other inability of our tenants operators or borrowers to make payments or comply with certain other lease obligations may affect our compliance with certain covenants contained in our debt securities credit facilities and the mortgages on the properties leased or managed by such borrowers tenants and operators or otherwise adversely affect 

our results of operations under certain conditions defaults under the underlying mortgages may result in cross default under our other indebtedness although we may be able to secure amendments under the applicable agreements in those circumstances the bankruptcy of a borrower tenant or operator may result in less favorable borrowing terms than currently available delays in the availability of funding or other materially adverse consequences 

increased competition and market and legislative changes have resulted and may further result in lower net revenues for some of our tenants operators and borrowers and may affect their ability to meet their financial and other contractual obligations to us 

the healthcare industry is highly competitive the occupancy levels at and rental income from our facilities are dependent on our ability and the ability of our tenants operators and borrowers to compete with other tenants and operators on a number of different levels including the quality of care provided reputation the physical appearance of a facility price the range of services offered family preference alternatives for healthcare delivery the supply of competing properties physicians staff referral sources location and the size and demographics of the population in the surrounding area in addition our tenants operators and borrowers face an increasingly competitive labor market for skilled management personnel and nurses an inability to attract and retain skilled management personnel and nurses and other trained personnel could negatively impact the ability of our tenants operators and borrowers to meet their obligations to us a shortage of nurses or other trained personnel or general inflationary pressures on wages may force tenants operators and borrowers to enhance pay and benefits packages to compete effectively for skilled personnel or to use more expensive contract personnel but they be unable to offset these added costs by increasing the rates charged to residents any increase in labor costs and other property operating expenses or any failure by our tenants operators or borrowers to attract and retain qualified personnel could adversely affect our cash flow and have a materially adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

our tenants operators and borrowers also compete with numerous other companies providing similar healthcare services or alternatives such as home health agencies life care at home communitybased service programs retirement communities and convalescent centers this competition which is due in part to overdevelopment in some segments in which we invest has caused the occupancy rate of newly constructed buildings to slow and the monthly rate that many newly built and previously existing facilities were able to obtain for their services to decrease our tenants operators and borrowers may be unable to achieve occupancy and rate levels and to manage their expenses in a way that will enable them to meet all of their obligations to us further many competing companies may have resources and attributes that are superior to those of our tenants operators and borrowers our tenants operators and borrowers may encounter increased competition that could limit their ability to maintain or attract residents or expand their businesses or to manage their expenses either of which could materially adversely affect their ability to meet their financial and other contractual obligations to us potentially decreasing our revenues and impairing our assets andor increasing collection and dispute costs 

in addition our operators’ revenues are determined by a number of factors including licensed bed capacity occupancy the healthcare needs of residents the rate of reimbursement and the income and assets of seniors in the regions in which we operate for example due to generally increased vulnerability to illness a severe flu season an epidemic or any other widespread illness could result in early moveouts or delayed moveins during quarantine periods which would reduce our operators’ revenues additionally new and evolving payor and provider programs in the united states including but not limited to medicare advantage dual eligible accountable care organizations and bundled payments have resulted in reduced reimbursement rates average length of stay and average daily census particularly for higher acuity patients 

furthermore potential executive orders and legislation have introduced uncertainty in the direction of the healthcare regulatory landscape and we cannot predict the impact of any regulatory or legislative changes on the industry or our ability to compete effectively therein see the risks described under “legislation and regulationthe requirements of or changes to governmental reimbursement programs such as medicare or medicaid may adversely affect our tenants’ operators’ and borrowers’ ability to meet their financial and other contractual obligations to us” 

competition may make it difficult to identify and purchase or develop suitable healthcare facilities to grow our investment portfolio to finance acquisitions on favorable terms or to retain or attract tenants and operators 

we face significant competition from other reits investment companies private equity and hedge fund investors sovereign funds healthcare operators lenders developers and other institutional investors some of whom may have greater resources and lower costs of capital than we do increased competition makes it more challenging for us to identify and successfully capitalize on opportunities that meet our business goals and could improve the bargaining power of property owners seeking to sell thereby impeding our investment acquisition and development activities similarly our properties face competition for tenants and operators from other properties in the same market which may affect our ability to attract and retain tenants and operators or may reduce the rents we are able to charge if we cannot capitalize on our development pipeline identify and purchase a sufficient 

quantity of healthcare facilities at favorable prices finance acquisitions on commercially favorable terms or attract and retain profitable tenants and operators our business results of operations and financial condition may be materially adversely affected 

we depend on investments in the healthcare property sector making our profitability more vulnerable to a downturn or slowdown in that specific sector than if we were investing in multiple industries 

we concentrate our investments in the healthcare property sector as a result we are subject to risks inherent to investments in a single industry a downturn or slowdown in the healthcare property sector would have a greater adverse impact on our business than if we had investments in multiple industries specifically a downturn in the healthcare property sector could negatively impact the ability of our tenants operators and borrowers to meet their obligations to us as well as the ability to maintain rental and occupancy rates this could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations in addition a downturn in the healthcare property sector could adversely affect the value of our properties and our ability to sell properties at prices or on terms acceptable to us 

in addition we are exposed to the risks inherent in concentrating our investments in real estate which investments are relatively illiquid our ability to quickly sell or transition any of our properties in response to changes in the performance of our properties or economic and other conditions is limited we may be unable to recognize full value for any property that we seek to sell for liquidity reasons our inability to respond rapidly to changes in the performance of our investments could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

changes within the life science industry may adversely impact our revenues and results of operations 

our life science investments could be adversely affected if the life science industry is impacted by an economic financial or banking crisis or if the life science industry migrates from the us to other countries or to areas outside of primary life science markets in south san francisco san diego and greater boston also some of our properties may be better suited for a particular life science industry client tenant and could require modification before we are able to release vacant space to another life science industry client tenant generally our properties may not be suitable for lease to traditional office client tenants without significant expenditures on renovations 

our ability to negotiate contractual rent escalations on future leases and to achieve increases in rental rates will depend upon market conditions and the demand for life science properties at the time the leases are negotiated and the increases are proposed 

many life science entities have completed mergers or consolidations future mergers or consolidations of life science entities could reduce the amount of rentable square footage requirements of our client tenants and prospective client tenants which may adversely impact our revenues from lease payments and results of operations 

our tenants in the life science industry face high levels of regulation expense and uncertainty 

life science tenants particularly those involved in developing and marketing pharmaceutical products are subject to certain unique risks including the following 



 if our tenants’ businesses are adversely affected they may have difficulty making payments to us which could materially adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

the hospitals on whose campuses our mobs are located and their affiliated healthcare systems could fail to remain competitive or financially viable which could adversely impact their ability to attract physicians and physician groups to our mobs and our other facilities that serve the healthcare industry 

our mobs and other facilities that serve the healthcare industry depend on the viability of the hospitals on whose campuses our mobs are located and their affiliated healthcare systems in order to attract physicians and other healthcarerelated users the viability of these hospitals in turn depends on factors such as the quality and mix of healthcare services provided competition demographic trends in the surrounding community market position and growth potential as well as the ability of the affiliated healthcare systems to provide economies of scale and access to capital if a hospital whose campus is located on or near one of our mobs is unable to meet its financial obligations and if an affiliated healthcare system is unable to support that hospital the hospital may not be able to compete successfully or could be forced to close or relocate which could adversely impact its ability to attract physicians and other healthcarerelated users because we rely on our proximity to and affiliations with these hospitals to create tenant demand for space in our mobs their inability to remain competitive or financially viable or to attract physicians and physician groups could adversely affect our mob operations and have a materially adverse effect on us 

in addition the potential repeal of the affordable care act and related regulations and uncertainty regarding potential replacement legislation could result in significant changes to the scope of insurance coverage and reimbursement policies which could put negative pressure on the operations and revenues of our mobs 

we may be unable to maintain or expand our relationships with our existing and future hospital and health system clients 

the success of our medical office portfolio depends to a large extent on past current and future relationships with hospitals and their affiliated health systems we invest significant amounts of time in developing relationships with both new and existing clients if we fail to maintain these relationships including through a lack of responsiveness failure to adapt to the current market and employment of individuals with adequate experience our reputation and relationships will be harmed and we may lose business to competitors if our relationships with hospitals and their affiliated health systems deteriorate it could have a materially adverse effect on us 

economic and other conditions that negatively affect geographic areas from which a greater percentage of our revenue is recognized could materially adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

for the year ended december 31 2017  26  of our revenue was derived from properties located in california which is also where substantially all of our life science portfolio is located as a result we are subject to increased exposure to adverse conditions affecting the state including downturns in the local economies or changes in local real estate conditions increased competition or decreased demand changes in statespecific legislation and local climate events and natural disasters such as earthquakes wildfires and hurricanes which could cause significant disruption in our businesses in the region harm our ability to compete effectively result in increased costs and divert more management attention any or all of which could adversely affect our business and results of operations 

if we must replace any of our tenants or operators we may have difficulty identifying replacements and we may be required to incur substantial renovation costs to make certain of our healthcare properties suitable for other tenants and operators 

we cannot predict whether our tenants will renew existing leases beyond their current term if we or our tenants terminate or do not renew the leases for our properties we would attempt to reposition those properties with another tenant or operator we may also voluntarily change operators for a variety of reasons for example in november 2017 we announced a plan to transition a significant number of properties managed by brookdale to other operators as part of our strategic plan to reduce our concentration of assets managed or leased by brookdale healthcare facilities are typically highly customized the improvements generally required to conform a property to healthcare use such as upgrading electrical gas and plumbing infrastructure are costly and at times tenantspecific and are typically subject to regulatory requirements a new or replacement tenant or operator may require different features in a property depending on that tenant’s or operator’s particular business in addition infrastructure improvements for life science facilities typically are significantly more costly than improvements to other property types and we may be unable to recover part or all of these higher costs therefore if a current tenant or operator is unable to pay rent andor vacates a property we may incur substantial expenditures to modify a property and experience delays before we are able to secure another tenant or operator or to accommodate multiple tenants or operators these expenditures or renovations and delays may materially adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

additionally we may fail to identify suitable replacements or enter into leases or other arrangements with new tenants or operators on a timely basis or on terms as favorable to us as our current leases if at all furthermore during transition periods to new tenants or operators we anticipate that the attention of existing tenants or operators will be diverted from the performance of the properties which would cause the financial and operational performance at these properties to further decline we also may be required to fund certain expenses and obligations such as real estate taxes debt costs and maintenance expenses to preserve the value of and avoid the imposition of liens on our properties while they are being repositioned in addition we may incur certain obligations and liabilities including obligations to indemnify the replacement tenant or operator which could have a materially adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

we face additional risks associated with property development and redevelopment that can render a project less profitable or not profitable at all and under certain circumstances prevent completion of development activities once undertaken 

property development is a component of our growth strategy at december 31 2017  our actual investment and estimated commitments under our development and redevelopment platforms including land held for development represented approximately 682 million  or 5  of our total assets largescale groundup development of healthcare properties presents additional risks for us including risks that 

 any of the foregoing risks could materially adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

our use of joint ventures may limit our flexibility with jointly owned investments 

we have and may continue to develop andor acquire properties in joint ventures with other persons or entities when circumstances warrant the use of these structures our participation in joint ventures is subject to risks that may not be present with other methods of ownership including 

 any of the foregoing risks could materially adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition in addition in some instances we andor our joint venture partner will have the right to cause us to sell our interest or acquire our partner’s interest at a time when we otherwise would not have initiated such a transaction our ability to acquire our partner’s interest will 

be limited if we do not have sufficient cash available borrowing capacity or other capital resources this would require us to sell our interest in the joint venture when we would otherwise prefer to retain it 

from time to time we have made and we may seek to make one or more material acquisitions which may involve the expenditure of significant funds 

we regularly review potential transactions in order to maximize stockholder value our review process may require significant management attention and a potential transaction could be abandoned or rejected by us or the other parties involved after we expend significant resources and time in addition future acquisitions may require the issuance of securities the incurrence of debt assumption of contingent liabilities or incurrence of significant expenditures each of which could materially adversely impact our business financial condition or results of operations in addition the financing required for acquisitions may not be available on commercially favorable terms or at all 

from time to time we acquire other companies and if we are unable to successfully integrate these operations our business results of operations and financial condition may be materially adversely affected 

acquisitions require the integration of companies that have previously operated independently successful integration of the operations of these companies depends primarily on our ability to consolidate operations systems procedures properties and personnel and to eliminate redundancies and costs we may encounter difficulties in these integrations potential difficulties associated with acquisitions include our ability to effectively monitor and manage our expanded portfolio of properties the loss of key employees the disruption of our ongoing business or that of the acquired entity possible inconsistencies in standards controls procedures and policies and the assumption of unexpected liabilities including 

 in addition the acquired companies and their properties may fail to perform as expected including in respect of estimated cost savings inaccurate assumptions regarding future rental or occupancy rates could result in overly optimistic estimates of future revenues similarly we may underestimate future operating expenses or the costs necessary to bring properties up to standards established for their intended use or for property improvements 

if we have difficulties with any of these areas or if we later discover additional liabilities or experience unforeseen costs relating to our acquired companies we might not achieve the economic benefits we expect from our acquisitions and this may materially adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

our tenants operators and borrowers face litigation and may experience rising liability and insurance costs 

in some states advocacy groups have been created to monitor the quality of care at healthcare facilities and these groups have brought litigation against the tenants and operators of such facilities also in several instances private litigation by patients residents or “whistleblowers” has sought and sometimes resulted in large damage awards see “the requirements of or changes to governmental reimbursement programs such as medicare or medicaid may adversely affect our tenants’ operators’ and borrowers’ ability to meet their financial and other contractual obligations to us” the effect of this litigation and other potential litigation may materially increase the costs incurred by our tenants operators and borrowers for monitoring and reporting quality of care compliance in addition their cost of liability and medical malpractice insurance can be significant and may increase or not be available at a reasonable cost so long as the present healthcare litigation environment continues cost increases could cause our tenants and operators to be unable to make their lease or mortgage payments or fail to purchase the appropriate liability and malpractice insurance or cause our borrowers to be unable to meet their obligations to us potentially decreasing our revenues and increasing our collection and litigation costs 

in addition as a result of our ownership of healthcare facilities we may be named as a defendant in lawsuits arising from the alleged actions of our tenants or operators while our operators generally have agreed to indemnify us for various claims litigation 

and liabilities arising in connection with their operation of our properties they may have insufficient assets income access to financing andor insurance coverage to enable them to satisfy their indemnification obligations in which case we would incur unanticipated expenditures furthermore although our leases and agreements provide us with certain information rights with respect to our tenants and operators one or more of our tenants may be or become party to pending litigation or investigation to which we are unaware or do not have a right to participate or evaluate in such cases we would be unable to determine the potential impact of such litigation or investigation on our tenants or our business or results moreover negative publicity of any of our operators’ or tenants’ litigation other legal proceedings or investigations may also negatively impact their and our reputation resulting in lower customer demand and revenues which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flow 

we through our subsidiaries enter into management contracts with third party eligible independent contractors to manage some of our facilities whereby we assume additional operational risks and are subject to additional regulation and liability 

ridea structures at the year ended december 31 2017  accounted for 12 of our total assets ridea permits reits such as us to lease healthcare facilities that we own or partially own to a trs provided that our trs hires an independent qualifying management company to operate the facility under the ridea lease structure the independent qualifying management company receives a management fee from our trs for operating the facility as an independent contractor as the owner of the facility contracting out operational responsibility we assume most of the operational risk relative to other structures because we lease our facility to our own partially or whollyowned subsidiary rather than a third party operator our resulting revenues therefore depend most on occupancy rates the rates charged to residents and the ability to control operating expenses our trs and hence we are responsible for any operating deficits incurred by the facility 

the operator which would be our trs when we use a ridea lease structure of a healthcare facility is generally required to be the holder of the applicable healthcare license this licensing requirement subjects our trs and us through our ownership interest in our trs to various regulatory laws including those described above most states regulate and inspect healthcare facility operations patient care construction and the safety of the physical environment if one or more of our healthcare real estate facilities fails to comply with applicable laws our trs if it holds the healthcare license and is the entity enrolled in government health care programs would be subject to penalties including loss or suspension of license certification or accreditation exclusion from government healthcare programs ie medicare medicaid administrative sanctions civil monetary penalties and in certain instances criminal penalties additionally when we receive individually identifiable health information relating to residents of our trsoperated healthcare facilities we are subject to federal and state data privacy and confidentiality laws and rules and could be subject to liability in the event of an audit complaint or data breach furthermore if our trs holds the healthcare license it could have exposure to professional liability claims arising out of an alleged breach of the applicable standard of care rules 

in addition rents from this trs structure are treated as qualifying rents from real property if i they are paid pursuant to an armslength lease of a “qualified healthcare property” with the trs and ii the manager qualifies as an “eligible independent contractor” as defined in the internal revenue code of 1986 as amended the “code” if either of these conditions is not satisfied then the rents will not be qualifying rents 

the requirements of or changes to governmental reimbursement programs such as medicare or medicaid may adversely affect our tenants’ operators’ and borrowers’ ability to meet their financial and other contractual obligations to us 

certain of our tenants operators and borrowers are affected directly or indirectly by an extremely complex set of federal state and local laws and regulations pertaining to governmental reimbursement programs these laws and regulations are subject to frequent and substantial changes that are sometimes applied retroactively see “item 1—business—government regulation licensing and enforcement” for example to the extent that our tenants operators or borrowers receive a significant portion of their revenues from governmental payors primarily medicare and medicaid they are generally subject to among other things 



 the failure to comply with the extensive laws regulations and other requirements applicable to their business and the operation of our properties could result in among other challenges i becoming ineligible to receive reimbursement from governmental reimbursement programs ii bans on admissions of new patients or residents iii civil or criminal penalties and iv significant operational changes these laws and regulations are enforced by a variety of federal state and local agencies and can also be enforced by private litigants through among other things federal and state false claims acts which allow private litigants to bring qui tam or “whistleblower” actions   

for example we have provided a loan to tandem health care “tandem” a property company that owns and operates 32 postacuteskilled nursing facilities in addition to operating nine leasehold interests totaling 4766 beds the “tandem portfolio” see note 7 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information affiliates of the sole tenant and operator of tandem’s facilities consulate were named in a qui tam or “whistleblower” action that alleged that consulate overbilled the federal government and the state of florida united states of america v cmc ii llc et al us district court md florida in february 2017 a jury returned an adverse verdict against five consulate entities as defendants resulting in a 348 million judgment against all defendants as a result of these legal and financial challenges consulate has failed to fully pay its contractual rent to tandem since april 1 2017 which has impacted tandem’s ability to service its debt obligations to us since november 10 2017 tandem has failed to make its required interest payment to us resulting in an event of default and adversely impacting our results of operations on january 11 2018 the court overturned the jury verdict against consulate and vacated the judgment the plaintiff has provided notice that it will appeal the ruling and we cannot predict the outcome it is also possible that the parties could reach an outofcourt settlement an unfavorable ruling against consulate on appeal would have a materially adverse effect on its financial condition cash flows and results of operations this would cause additional declines in the tandem portfolio’s operating performance and would likely negatively affect consulate’s and tandem’s ability to raise capital which would further adversely affect tandem’s ability to meet its debt service obligations to us we are currently evaluating our options in respect of the tandem mezzanine loan regardless of the ultimate outcome our tenants operators and borrowers could be adversely affected by the resources required to respond to an investigation or other enforcement action in such event the results of operations and financial condition of our tenants and the results of operations of our properties operated by those entities could be materially adversely affected which in turn could have a materially adverse effect on us 

we are unable to predict future federal state and local regulations and legislation including the medicare and medicaid statutes and regulations or the intensity of enforcement efforts with respect to such regulations and legislation and any changes in the regulatory framework could have a materially adverse effect on our tenants and operators which in turn could have a materially adverse effect on us 

sometimes governmental payors freeze or reduce payments to healthcare providers or provide annual reimbursement rate increases that are smaller than expected due to budgetary and other pressures healthcare reimbursement will likely continue to be of significant importance to federal and state authorities we cannot make any assessment as to the ultimate timing or the effect that any future legislative reforms may have on our tenants’ operators’ and borrowers’ costs of doing business and on the amount of reimbursement by government and other thirdparty payors the failure of any of our tenants operators or borrowers to comply with these laws and regulations and significant limits on the scope of services reimbursed and on reimbursement rates and fees could materially adversely affect their ability to meet their financial and contractual obligations to us 

furthermore executive orders and legislation may amend or repeal the affordable care act and related regulations in whole or in part we also anticipate that congress state legislatures and thirdparty payors may continue to review and assess alternative healthcare delivery and payment systems and may propose and adopt legislation or policy changes or implementations effecting additional fundamental changes in the healthcare system we cannot quantify or predict the likely impact of these possible changes on our business model prospects financial condition or results of operations 

legislation to address federal government operations and administration decisions affecting the centers for medicare and medicaid services could have a materially adverse effect on our tenants’ operators’ and borrowers’ liquidity financial condition or results of operations 

congressional consideration of legislation pertaining to the federal debt ceiling the affordable care act tax reform and entitlement programs including reimbursement rates for physicians could have a materially adverse effect on our tenants’ operators’ and borrowers’ liquidity financial condition or results of operations in particular reduced funding for entitlement programs such as medicare and medicaid would result in increased costs and fees for programs such as medicare advantage plans and additional reductions in reimbursements to providers amendments to or repeal of the affordable care act and decisions by the centers for medicare and medicaid services could impact the delivery of services and benefits under medicare medicaid or medicare 

advantage plans and could affect our tenants and operators and the manner in which they are reimbursed by such programs such changes could have a materially adverse effect on our tenants’ operators’ and borrowers’ liquidity financial condition or results of operations which could adversely affect their ability to satisfy their obligations to us and could have a materially adverse effect on us 

compliance with the americans with disabilities act and fire safety and other regulations may require us to make expenditures that adversely affect our cash flows 

our properties must comply with applicable ada and any similar state and local laws this may require removal of barriers to access by persons with disabilities in public areas of our properties noncompliance could result in imposition of fines or an award of damages to private litigants and the incurrence of additional costs associated with bringing the properties into compliance while the tenants to whom we lease our properties are obligated to comply with the ada and similar state and local provisions and typically under tenant leases are obligated to cover costs associated with compliance if required changes involve greater expenditures than anticipated or if the changes must be made on a more accelerated basis than anticipated the ability of these tenants to cover costs could be adversely affected as a result we could be required to expend funds to comply with the provisions of the ada and similar state and local laws on behalf of tenants which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

in addition we are required to operate our properties in compliance with fire and safety regulations building codes and other land use regulations new and revised regulations and codes may be adopted by governmental agencies and bodies and become applicable to our properties compliance could require substantial capital expenditures and may restrict our ability to renovate our properties these expenditures and restrictions could have a material adverse effect on our ability to meet our financial obligations 

tenants and operators that fail to comply with federal state local and international laws and regulations including licensure certification and inspection requirements may cease to operate or be unable to meet their financial and other contractual obligations to us 

our tenants operators and borrowers are subject to or impacted by extensive frequently changing federal state local and international laws and regulations these laws and regulations include among others laws protecting consumers against deceptive practices laws relating to the operation of our properties and how our tenants and operators conduct their business such as fire health and safety data security and privacy laws federal and state laws affecting hospitals clinics and other healthcare communities that participate in both medicare and medicaid that mandate allowable costs pricing reimbursement procedures and limitations quality of services and care food service and physical plants and similar foreign laws regulating the healthcare industry resident rights laws including abuse and neglect laws and fraud laws antikickback and physician referral laws the ada and similar state and local laws and safety and health standards set by the occupational safety and health administration or similar foreign agencies certain of our properties may also require a license registration andor certificate of need to operate 

our tenants’ operators’ or borrowers’ failure to comply with any of these laws regulations or requirements could result in loss of accreditation denial of reimbursement imposition of fines suspension or decertification from government healthcare programs civil liability loss of license or closure of the facility andor the incurrence of considerable costs arising from an investigation or regulatory action which may have an adverse effect on facilities owned by or mortgaged to us and therefore may materially adversely impact us see “item 1—business—government regulation licensing and enforcement—healthcare licensure and certificate of need” above 

we may be unable to successfully foreclose on the collateral securing our real estaterelated loans and even if we are successful in our foreclosure efforts we may be unable to successfully operate occupy or reposition the underlying real estate which may adversely affect our ability to recover our investments 

if a tenant or operator defaults under one of our mortgages or mezzanine loans we may have to foreclose on the loan or protect our interest by acquiring title to the collateral and thereafter making substantial improvements or repairs in order to maximize the property’s investment potential in some cases the collateral consists of the equity interests in an entity that directly or indirectly owns the applicable real property or interests in operating facilities and accordingly we may not have full recourse to assets of that entity or that entity may have incurred unexpected liabilities tenants operators or borrowers may contest enforcement of foreclosure or other remedies seek bankruptcy protection against our exercise of enforcement or other remedies andor bring claims for lender liability in response to actions to enforce mortgage obligations foreclosurerelated costs high loantovalue ratios or declines in the value of the facility may prevent us from realizing an amount equal to our mortgage or mezzanine loan upon foreclosure and we may be required to record a valuation allowance for such losses even if we are able to successfully foreclose on the collateral securing our real estaterelated loans we may inherit properties for which we may be unable to expeditiously secure tenants or operators if at all or we may acquire equity interests that we are unable to immediately resell due to limitations under the securities laws either of which would adversely affect our ability to fully recover our investment 

required regulatory approvals can delay or prohibit transfers of our healthcare facilities 

transfers of healthcare facilities to successor tenants or operators are typically subject to regulatory approvals or ratifications including but not limited to change of ownership approvals and medicare and medicaid provider arrangements that are not required for transfers of other types of commercial operations and other types of real estate the replacement of any tenant or operator could be delayed by the regulatory approval process of any federal state or local government agency necessary for the transfer of the facility or the replacement of the operator licensed to manage the facility if we are unable to find a suitable replacement tenant or operator upon favorable terms or at all we may take possession of a facility which could expose us to successor liability require us to indemnify subsequent operators to whom we transfer the operating rights and licenses or require us to spend substantial time and funds to preserve the value of the property and adapt the facility to other uses all of which may materially adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

risks related to our capital structure and market conditions 

interest rate increases could result in a decrease in our stock price and increased interest costs on new debt and existing variable rate debt which could materially adversely impact our ability to refinance existing debt sell assets and conduct acquisition investment and development activities 

an increase in interest rates could reduce the amount investors are willing to pay for our common stock because reit stocks are often perceived as highyield investments investors may perceive less relative benefit to owning reit stocks as interest rates and the yield on government treasuries and other bonds increase 

additionally we have existing debt obligations that are variable rate obligations with interest and related payments that vary with the movement of certain indices if interest rates increase so would our interest costs for any variable rate debt and for new debt this increased cost would make the financing of any acquisition and development activity more costly rising interest rates could limit our ability to refinance existing debt when it matures or cause us to pay higher interest rates upon refinancing and increase interest expense on refinanced indebtedness in addition an increase in interest rates could decrease the amount third parties are willing to pay for our assets thereby limiting our ability to reposition our portfolio promptly in response to changes in economic or other conditions 

we manage a portion of our exposure to interest rate risk by accessing debt with staggered maturities and through the use of derivative instruments primarily interest rate swap agreements however no amount of hedging activity can fully insulate us from the risks associated with changes in interest rates swap agreements involve risk including that counterparties may fail to honor their obligations under these arrangements that these arrangements may not be effective in reducing our exposure to interest rate changes that the amount of income we earn from hedging transactions may be limited by federal tax provisions governing reits and that these arrangements may cause us to pay higher interest rates on our debt obligations than would otherwise be the case failure to hedge effectively against interest rate risk could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

we rely on external sources of capital to fund future capital needs and if access to such capital is unavailable on acceptable terms or at all it could have a materially adverse effect on our ability to meet commitments as they become due or make future investments necessary to grow our business 

we may not be able to fund all future capital needs including capital expenditures debt maturities and other commitments from cash retained from operations and dispositions if we are unable to obtain enough internal capital we may need to rely on external sources of capital including debt and equity financing to fulfill our capital requirements our access to capital depends upon a number of factors some of which we have little or no control over including but not limited to 



 in 2017 we announced our plans to sell a significant number of assets managed or leased by brookdale our remaining interest in ridea ii our mezzanine loan facility to tandem and our uk portfolio if these transactions are successful our financial leverage is projected to decrease which could improve our access to capital on favorable terms however these transactions may not be completed on a timely basis or at all which would delay or impede our deleveraging plan if access to capital is unavailable on acceptable terms or at all it could have a materially adverse impact on our ability to fund operations repay or refinance our debt obligations fund dividend payments acquire properties and make the investments needed to grow our business 

adverse changes in our credit ratings could impair our ability to obtain additional debt and equity financing on favorable terms if at all and negatively impact the market price of our securities including our common stock 

our credit ratings can affect the amount and type of capital we can access as well as the terms of any financing we may obtain we may be unable to maintain our current credit ratings and in the event that our current credit ratings deteriorate we would likely incur higher borrowing costs which would make it more difficult or expensive to obtain additional financing or refinance existing obligations and commitments also a downgrade in our credit ratings would trigger additional costs or other potentially negative consequences under our current and future credit facilities and debt instruments the credit ratings of our senior unsecured debt are based on among other things our operating performance liquidity and leverage ratios overall financial position level of indebtedness and pending or future changes in the regulatory framework applicable to our operators and our industry 

our level of indebtedness may increase and materially adversely affect our future operations 

our outstanding indebtedness as of december 31 2017  was approximately 79 billion  we may incur additional indebtedness including in connection with the development or acquisition of assets which may be substantial any significant additional indebtedness would likely negatively affect the credit ratings of our debt and require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow to interest and principal payments due on our indebtedness greater demands on our cash resources may reduce funds available to us to pay dividends conduct development activities make capital expenditures and acquisitions or carry out other aspects of our business strategy increased indebtedness can also make us more vulnerable to general adverse economic and industry conditions and create competitive disadvantages for us compared to other companies with relatively lower debt levels increased future debt service obligations may limit our operational flexibility including our ability to finance or refinance our properties contribute properties to joint ventures or sell properties as needed 

covenants in our debt instruments limit our operational flexibility and breaches of these covenants could materially adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

the terms of our current secured and unsecured debt instruments and other indebtedness that we may incur require or will require us to comply with a number of customary financial and other covenants such as maintaining leverage ratios minimum tangible net worth requirements reit status and certain levels of debt service coverage our continued ability to incur additional debt and to conduct business in general is subject to compliance with these financial and other covenants which limit our operational flexibility for example mortgages on our properties contain customary covenants such as those that limit or restrict our ability without the consent of the lender to further encumber or sell the applicable properties or to replace the applicable tenant or operator breaches of certain covenants may result in defaults under the mortgages on our properties and crossdefaults under certain of our other indebtedness even if we satisfy our payment obligations to the respective obligee   covenants that limit our operational flexibility as well as defaults resulting from the breach of any of these covenants could materially adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

cash available for distribution to stockholders may be insufficient to make dividend distributions at expected levels and are made at the discretion of our board of directors 

if cash available for distribution generated by our assets decreases as a result of our announced dispositions or otherwise we may be unable to make dividend distributions at expected levels our inability to make expected distributions would likely result in a decrease in the market price of our common stock all distributions are made at the discretion of our board of directors in accordance with maryland law and depend on our earnings our financial condition debt and equity capital available to us our expectations of our future capital requirements and operating performance restrictive covenants in our financial or other contractual arrangements including those in our credit facility agreement maintenance of our reit qualification restrictions under maryland law and other factors as our board of directors may deem relevant from time to time additionally our ability to make distributions will be adversely affected if any of the risks described herein or other significant adverse events occur 

volatility disruption or uncertainty in the financial markets may impair our ability to raise capital obtain new financing or refinance existing obligations and fund real estate and development activities 

we may be affected by general market and economic conditions increased or prolonged market disruption volatility or uncertainty could materially adversely impact our ability to raise capital obtain new financing or refinance our existing obligations as they mature and fund real estate and development activities market volatility could also lead to significant uncertainty in the valuation of our investments and those of our joint ventures which may result in a substantial decrease in the value of our properties and those of our joint ventures as a result we may be unable to recover the carrying amount of such investments and the associated goodwill if any which may require us to recognize impairment charges in earnings 

we may be adversely affected by fluctuations in currency exchange rates 

we have certain investments in international markets where the us dollar is not the denominated currency the ownership of investments located outside of the united states subjects us to risk from fluctuations in exchange rates between foreign currencies and the us dollar a significant change in the value of the british pound sterling “gbp” may have a materially adverse effect on our financial position debt covenant ratios results of operations and cash flow 

we may attempt to manage the impact of foreign currency exchange rate changes through the use of derivative contracts or other methods for example we currently utilize gbp denominated liabilities as a natural hedge against our gbp denominated assets additionally we executed currency swap contracts to hedge the risk related to a portion of the forecasted interest receipts on these investments however no amount of hedging activity can fully insulate us from the risks associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates and the failure to hedge effectively against foreign currency exchange rate risk if we choose to engage in such activities could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition in addition any international currency gain recognized with respect to changes in exchange rates may not qualify under the 75 gross income test or the 95 gross income test that we must satisfy annually in order to qualify and maintain our status as a reit 

risks related to other events 

we are subject to certain provisions of maryland law and our charter relating to business combinations which may prevent a transaction that may otherwise be in the interest of our stockholders 

the maryland business combination act provides that unless exempted a maryland corporation may not engage in business combinations including a merger consolidation share exchange or in circumstances specified in the statute an asset transfer or issuance or reclassification of equity securities with an “interested stockholder” or an affiliate of an interested stockholder for five years after the most recent date on which the interested stockholder became an interested stockholder and thereafter unless specified criteria are met an interested stockholder is generally a person owning or controlling directly or indirectly 10 or more of the voting power of the outstanding voting stock of a maryland corporation unless our board of directors takes action to exempt us generally or with respect to certain transactions from this statute the maryland business combination act will be applicable to business combinations between us and other persons 

in addition to the restrictions on business combinations contained in the maryland business combination act our charter also contains restrictions on business combinations our charter requires that except in certain circumstances “business combinations” including a merger or consolidation and certain asset transfers and issuances of securities with a “related person” including a beneficial owner of 10 or more of our outstanding voting stock be approved by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 90 of our outstanding voting stock 

the restrictions on business combinations provided under maryland law and contained in our charter may delay defer or prevent a change of control or other transaction even if such transaction involves a premium price for our common stock or our stockholders believe that such transaction is otherwise in their best interests 

unfavorable resolution of litigation matters and disputes could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition 

from time to time we are involved in legal proceedings lawsuits and other claims we may also be named as defendants in lawsuits arising out of our alleged actions or the alleged actions of our tenants and operators for which such tenants and operators have agreed to indemnify defend and hold us harmless an unfavorable resolution of any such litigation may have a materially adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition regardless of the outcome litigation or other legal proceedings may result in substantial costs disruption of our normal business operations and the diversion of management attention we may be unable to prevail in or achieve a favorable settlement of any pending or future legal action against us see item 3—legal proceedings of this annual report on form 10k 

loss of our key personnel could temporarily disrupt our operations and adversely affect us 

we depend on the efforts of our executive officers and competition for these individuals is intense although they are covered by our executive severance plan and change in control plan which provide many of the benefits typically found in executive employment agreements none of our executive officers have employment agreements with us the loss or limited availability of the services of any of our executive officers or our inability to recruit and retain qualified personnel could at least temporarily have a materially adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition and the value of our common stock 

we may experience uninsured or underinsured losses which could result in a significant loss of the capital invested in a property lower than expected future revenues or unanticipated expense 

we maintain and regularly review the comprehensive insurance coverage on our properties with terms conditions limits and deductibles that we believe are adequate and appropriate given the relative risk and costs of such coverage however a large number of our properties are located in areas exposed to earthquake windstorm flood and other natural disasters in particular our life science portfolio is concentrated in areas known to be subject to earthquake activity while we purchase insurance coverage for earthquake windstorm flood and other natural disasters that we believe is adequate in light of current industry practice and analyses prepared by outside consultants such insurance may not fully cover such losses for example we incurred uninsured losses of approximately 11 million during 2017 as a result of hurricanerelated property damage these losses can result in decreased anticipated revenues from a property and the loss of all or a portion of the capital we have invested in a property following these events we may remain liable for any mortgage debt or other financial obligations related to the property the insurance market for such exposures can be very volatile and we may be unable to purchase the limits and terms we desire on a commercially reasonable basis in addition there are certain exposures for which we do not purchase insurance because we do not believe it is economically feasible to do so or where there is no viable insurance market 

if one of our properties experiences a loss that is uninsured or that exceeds policy coverage limits we could lose our investment in the damaged property as well as the anticipated future cash flows from such property if the damaged property is subject to recourse indebtedness we could continue to be liable for the indebtedness even if the property is irreparably damaged 

in addition even if damage to our properties is covered by insurance a disruption of business caused by a casualty event may result in loss of revenues for us any business interruption insurance may not fully compensate the lender or us for such loss of revenue 

environmental compliance costs and liabilities associated with our real estaterelated investments may be substantial and may materially impair the value of those investments 

federal state and local laws ordinances and regulations may require us as a current or previous owner of real estate to investigate and clean up certain hazardous or toxic substances or petroleum released at a property we may be held liable to a governmental entity or to third parties for property damage and for investigation and cleanup costs incurred by the third parties in connection with the contamination the costs of cleanup and remediation could be substantial in addition some environmental laws create a lien on the contaminated site in favor of the government for damages and the costs it incurs in connection with the contamination 

although we currently carry environmental insurance on our properties in an amount that we believe is commercially reasonable and generally require our tenants and operators to indemnify us for environmental liabilities they cause such liabilities could exceed the amount of our insurance the financial ability of the tenant or operator to indemnify us or the value of the contaminated property as the owner of a site we may also be held liable to third parties for damages and injuries resulting from environmental contamination emanating from the site we may also experience environmental liabilities arising from conditions not known to 

us the cost of defending against these claims complying with environmental regulatory requirements conducting remediation of any contaminated property or paying personal injury or other claims or fines could be substantial and could have a materially adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

in addition the presence of contamination or the failure to remediate contamination may materially adversely affect our ability to use sell or lease the property or to borrow using the property as collateral 

we rely on information technology in our operations and any material failure inadequacy interruption or security failure of that technology could harm our business 

we rely on information technology networks and systems including the internet to process transmit and store electronic information and to manage or support a variety of business processes including financial transactions and records and maintaining personal identifying information and tenant and lease data we purchase some of our information technology from vendors on whom our systems depend we rely on commercially available systems software tools and monitoring to provide security for the processing transmission and storage of confidential tenant and customer data including individually identifiable information relating to financial accounts although we have taken steps to protect the security of our information systems and the data maintained in those systems it is possible that our safety and security measures will not prevent the systems’ improper functioning or damage or the improper access or disclosure of personally identifiable information such as in the event of cyberattacks in addition the pace and unpredictability of cyber threats generally quickly renders longterm implementation plans designed to address cybersecurity risks obsolete security breaches including those caused by physical or electronic breakins computer viruses malware worms attacks by hackers or foreign governments disruptions from unauthorized access and tampering including through social engineering such as phishing attacks coordinated denialofservice attacks and similar breaches can create system disruptions shutdowns or unauthorized disclosure of confidential information the risk of security breaches has generally increased as the number intensity and sophistication of attacks and intrusions have increased in some cases it may be difficult to anticipate or immediately detect such incidents and the damage they cause in addition our technology infrastructure and information systems are vulnerable to damage or interruption from natural disasters power loss and telecommunications failures any failure to maintain proper function security and availability of our information systems and the data maintained in those systems could interrupt our operations damage our reputation subject us to liability claims or regulatory penalties and could have a materially adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

risk related to tax including reitrelated risks 

loss of our tax status as a reit would substantially reduce our available funds and would have materially adverse consequences for us and the value of our common stock 

qualification as a reit involves the application of numerous highly technical and complex provisions of the code for which there are only limited judicial and administrative interpretations as well as the determination of various factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control we intend to continue to operate in a manner that enables us to qualify as a reit however our qualification and taxation as a reit depend upon our ability to meet through actual annual operating results asset diversification distribution levels and diversity of stock ownership the various qualification tests imposed under the code for example to qualify as a reit at least 95 of our gross income in any year must be derived from qualifying sources and we must make distributions to our stockholders aggregating annually at least 90 of our reit taxable income excluding net capital gains in addition new legislation regulations administrative interpretations or court decisions could change the tax laws or interpretations of the tax laws regarding qualification as a reit or the federal income tax consequences of that qualification in a manner that is materially adverse to our stockholders accordingly there is no assurance that we have operated or will continue to operate in a manner so as to qualify or remain qualified as a reit 

if we lose our reit status we will face serious tax consequences that will substantially reduce the funds available to make payments of principal and interest on the debt securities we issue and to make distributions to stockholders if we fail to qualify as a reit 



as a result of all these factors our failure to qualify as a reit could also impair our ability to expand our business and raise capital and could materially adversely affect the value of our common stock 

the present federal income tax treatment of reits may be modified possibly with retroactive effect by legislative judicial or administrative action at any time which could affect the federal income tax treatment of an investment in us the federal income tax rules dealing with reits constantly are under review by persons involved in the legislative process the us internal revenue service the “irs” and the us treasury department which results in statutory changes as well as frequent revisions to regulations and interpretations revisions in federal tax laws and interpretations thereof could affect or cause us to change our investments and commitments and affect the tax considerations of an investment in us 

we could have potential deferred and contingent tax liabilities from corporate acquisitions that could limit delay or impede future sales of our properties 

if during the fiveyear period beginning on the date we acquire certain companies we recognize a gain on the disposition of any property acquired then to the extent of the excess of i the fair market value of such property as of the acquisition date over ii our adjusted income tax basis in such property as of that date we will be required to pay a corporatelevel federal income tax on this gain at the highest regular corporate rate there can be no assurance that these triggering dispositions will not occur and these requirements could limit delay or impede future sales of our properties 

in addition the irs may assert liabilities against us for corporate income taxes for taxable years prior to the time that we acquire certain companies in which case we will owe these taxes plus interest and penalties if any 

there are uncertainties relating to the calculation of nonreit tax earnings and profits “ep” in certain acquisitions which may require us to distribute ep 

in order to remain qualified as a reit we are required to distribute to our stockholders all of the accumulated nonreit ep of certain companies that we acquire prior to the close of the first taxable year in which the acquisition occurs failure to make such ep distributions would result in our disqualification as a reit the determination of the amount to be distributed in such ep distributions is a complex factual and legal determination we may have less than complete information at the time we undertake our analysis or we may interpret the applicable law differently from the irs we currently believe that we have satisfied the requirements relating to such ep distributions there are however substantial uncertainties relating to the determination of ep including the possibility that the irs could successfully assert that the taxable income of the companies acquired should be increased which would increase our nonreit ep moreover an audit of the acquired company following our acquisition could result in an increase in accumulated nonreit ep which could require us to pay an additional taxable distribution to our thenexisting stockholders if we qualify under rules for curing this type of default or could result in our disqualification as a reit 

thus we might fail to satisfy the requirement that we distribute all of our nonreit ep by the close of the first taxable year in which the acquisition occurs moreover although there are procedures available to cure a failure to distribute all of our ep we cannot now determine whether we will be able to take advantage of these procedures or the economic impact on us of doing so 

changes to us federal income tax laws could materially and adversely affect us and our stockholders 

the recently enacted tax cuts and jobs act the ‘‘act’’ makes substantial changes to the code among those changes are a significant permanent reduction in the generally applicable corporate tax rate changes in the taxation of individuals and other noncorporate taxpayers that generally but not universally reduce their taxes on a temporary basis subject to ‘‘sunset’’ provisions the elimination or modification of various currently allowed deductions including substantial limitations on the deductibility of interest and in the case of individuals the deduction for personal state and local taxes certain additional limitations on the deduction of net operating losses and preferential rates of taxation on most ordinary reit dividends and certain business income derived by noncorporate taxpayers in comparison to other ordinary income recognized by such taxpayers the effect of these and the many other changes made in the act is highly uncertain both in terms of their direct effect on the taxation of an investment in our common stock and their indirect effect on the value of our assets or market conditions generally furthermore many of the provisions of the act will require guidance through the issuance of treasury regulations in order to assess their effect there may be a substantial delay before such regulations are promulgated increasing the uncertainty as to the ultimate effect of the statutory amendments on us it is also likely that there will be technical corrections legislation proposed with respect to the act next year the effect of which cannot be predicted and may be adverse to us or our stockholders 

our international investments and operations may result in additional taxrelated risks 

we have investments and operations in the uk and may further expand internationally international expansion presents taxrelated risks that are different from those we face with respect to our domestic properties and operations these risks include but are not limited to 

 our charter contains ownership limits with respect to our common stock and other classes of capital stock 

our charter contains restrictions on the ownership and transfer of our common stock and preferred stock that are intended to assist us in preserving our qualification as a reit under our charter subject to certain exceptions no person or entity may own actually or constructively more than 98 by value or by number of shares whichever is more restrictive of the outstanding shares of our common stock or any class or series of our preferred stock 

additionally our charter has a 99 ownership limitation on the direct or indirect ownership of our voting shares which may include common stock or other classes of capital stock our board of directors in its sole discretion may exempt a proposed transferee from either ownership limit the ownership limits may delay defer or prevent a transaction or a change of control that might involve a premium price for our common stock or might otherwise be in the best interests of our stockholders

results of operations 

we evaluate our business and allocate resources among our reportable business segments i senior housing triplenet ii senior housing operating portfolio shop iii life science and iv medical office   under the medical office and life science segments we invest through the acquisition and development of mobs and life science facilities which generally require a greater level of property management our senior housing facilities are managed utilizing triplenet leases and ridea structures we have other nonreportable segments that are comprised primarily of our uk care homes debt investments unconsolidated joint ventures and hospitals we evaluate performance based upon i property net operating income from continuing operations “noi” and ii adjusted noi cash noi in each segment the accounting policies of the segments are the same as those described in the summary of significant accounting policies see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements 

nongaap financial measures 

net operating income 

noi and adjusted noi are nonus generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” supplemental financial measures used to evaluate the operating performance of real estate noi is defined as rental and related revenues including tenant recoveries 

resident fees and services and income from dfls less property level operating expenses noi excludes all other financial statement amounts included in net income loss as presented in note 13 to the consolidated financial statements management believes noi provides relevant and useful information because it reflects only income and operating expense items that are incurred at the property level and presents them on an unleveraged basis adjusted noi is calculated as noi after eliminating the effects of straightline rents dfl noncash interest amortization of market lease intangibles termination fees and the impact of deferred community fee income and expense the adjustments to noi and resulting adjusted noi for shop have been recast for prior periods presented to conform to the current period presentation which excludes the impact of deferred community fee income and expense resulting in recognition as cash is received and expenses are paid adjusted noi is oftentimes referred to as “cash noi” during the fourth quarter of 2017 as a result of a change in how operating results are reported to our chief operating decision makers for the purpose of evaluating performance and allocating resources we began excluding unconsolidated joint ventures from the evaluation of our segments operating results unconsolidated joint ventures are now reflected in other nonreportable segments and as a result excluded from noi and adjusted noi prior period noi and adjusted noi have also been recast to conform to current period presentation which excludes unconsolidated joint ventures we use noi and adjusted noi to make decisions about resource allocations to assess and compare property level performance and to evaluate our same property portfolio “spp” as described below we believe that net income loss is the most directly comparable gaap measure to noi noi should not be viewed as an alternative measure of operating performance to net income loss as defined by gaap since it does not reflect various excluded items further our definition of noi may not be comparable to the definition used by other reits or real estate companies as they may use different methodologies for calculating noi for a reconciliation of noi and adjusted noi to net income loss by segment refer to note 13 to the consolidated financial statements 

operating expenses generally relate to leased medical office and life science properties and shop facilities we generally recover all or a portion of our leased medical office and life science property expenses through tenant recoveries we present expenses as operating or general and administrative based on the underlying nature of the expense 

same property portfolio 

spp noi and adjusted noi information allows us to evaluate the performance of our property portfolio under a consistent population by eliminating changes in the composition of our consolidated portfolio of properties spp noi excludes certain nonproperty specific operating expenses that are allocated to each operating segment on a consolidated basis spp noi for properties that undergo a change in ownership is reported based on the current ownership percentage 

properties are included in spp once they are stabilized for the full period in both comparison periods newly acquired operating assets are generally considered stabilized at the earlier of leaseup typically when the tenants controls the physical use of at least 80 of the space or 12 months from the acquisition date newly completed developments and redevelopments are considered stabilized at the earlier of leaseup or 24 months from the date the property is placed in service properties that experience a change in reporting structure such as a transition from a triplenet lease to a ridea reporting structure are considered stabilized after 12 months in operations under a consistent reporting structure a property is removed from spp when it is classified as held for sale sold placed into redevelopment experiences a casualty event that significantly impacts operations or changes its reporting structure such as triplenet to shop 

for a reconciliation of spp to total portfolio adjusted noi and other relevant disclosures by segment refer to our segment analysis below 

funds from operations 

we believe ffo applicable to common shares diluted ffo applicable to common shares and diluted ffo per common share are important supplemental nongaap measures of operating performance for a reit because the historical cost accounting convention used for real estate assets utilizes straightline depreciation except on land such accounting presentation implies that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time since real estate values instead have historically risen and fallen with market conditions presentations of operating results for a reit that use historical cost accounting for depreciation could be less informative the term ffo was designed by the reit industry to address this issue 

ffo as defined by the national association of real estate investment trusts “nareit” is net income loss applicable to common shares computed in accordance with gaap excluding gains or losses from sales of depreciable property including any current and deferred taxes directly associated with sales of depreciable property impairments of or related to depreciable real estate plus real estate and other depreciation and amortization and adjustments to compute our share of ffo and ffo as adjusted see below from joint ventures adjustments for joint ventures are calculated to reflect our prorata share of both our consolidated and unconsolidated joint ventures we reflect our share of ffo for unconsolidated joint ventures by applying our actual ownership percentage for the period to the applicable reconciling items on an entity by entity basis for consolidated joint ventures in which we do not own 100 we reflect our share of the equity by adjusting our ffo to remove the third party ownership share of the applicable reconciling items based on actual ownership percentage for the applicable periods our prorata share information is prepared on a basis consistent with the comparable consolidated amounts is intended to reflect our proportionate 

economic interest in the operating results of properties in our portfolio and is calculated by applying our actual ownership percentage for the period we do not control the unconsolidated joint ventures and the prorata presentations of reconciling items included in ffo do not represent our legal claim to such items the joint venture members or partners are entitled to profit or loss allocations and distributions of cash flows according to the joint venture agreements which provide for such allocations generally according to their invested capital 

the presentation of prorata information has limitations which include but are not limited to the following i the amounts shown on the individual line items were derived by applying our overall economic ownership interest percentage determined when applying the equity method of accounting and do not necessarily represent our legal claim to the assets and liabilities or the revenues and expenses and ii other companies in our industry may calculate their prorata interest differently limiting the usefulness as a comparative measure because of these limitations the prorata financial information should not be considered independently or as a substitute for our financial statements as reported under gaap we compensate for these limitations by relying primarily on our gaap financial statements using the prorata financial information as a supplement 

ffo does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with gaap is not necessarily indicative of cash available to fund cash needs and should not be considered an alternative to net income loss we compute ffo in accordance with the current nareit definition however other reits may report ffo differently or have a different interpretation of the current nareit definition from ours 

in addition we present ffo  before the impact of noncomparable items including but not limited to transactionrelated items impairments recoveries of nondepreciable assets severance and related charges prepayment costs benefits associated with early retirement or payment of debt litigation costs casualtyrelated charges recoveries foreign currency remeasurement losses gains and changes in tax legislation “ffo as adjusted” transactionrelated items include transaction expenses and gainscharges incurred as a result of mergers and acquisitions and lease amendment or termination activities prepayment costs benefits associated with early retirement of debt include the writeoff of unamortized deferred financing fees or additional costs expenses discounts makewhole payments penalties or premiums incurred as a result of early retirement or payment of debt  management believes that ffo as adjusted provides a meaningful supplemental measurement of our ffo runrate and is frequently used by analysts investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of our performance as a reit at the same time that nareit created and defined its ffo measure for the reit industry it also recognized that “management of each of its member companies has the responsibility and authority to publish financial information that it regards as useful to the financial community” we believe stockholders potential investors and financial analysts who review our operating performance are best served by an ffo runrate earnings measure that includes certain other adjustments to net income loss in addition to adjustments made to arrive at the nareit defined measure of ffo ffo as adjusted is used by management in analyzing our business and the performance of our properties and we believe it is important that stockholders potential investors and financial analysts understand this measure used by management we use ffo as adjusted to i evaluate our performance in comparison with expected results and results of previous periods relative to resource allocation decisions ii evaluate the performance of our management iii budget and forecast future results to assist in the allocation of resources iv assess our performance as compared with similar real estate companies and the industry in general and v evaluate how a specific potential investment will impact our future results other reits or real estate companies may use different methodologies for calculating an adjusted ffo measure and accordingly our ffo as adjusted may not be comparable to those reported by other reits for a reconciliation of net income loss to ffo and ffo as adjusted and other relevant disclosure refer to “nongaap financial measures reconciliations” below

fad is defined as ffo as adjusted after excluding the impact of the following i amortization of deferred compensation expense ii amortization of deferred financing costs net iii straightline rents iv amortization of acquired market lease intangibles net v noncash interest and depreciation related to dfls and lease incentive amortization reduction of straightline rents and vi deferred revenues excluding amounts amortized into rental income that are associated with tenant funded improvements ownedrecognized by us and upfront cash payments made by tenants to reduce their contractual rents also fad i is computed after deducting recurring capital expenditures including leasing costs and second generation tenant and capital improvements and ii includes lease restructure payments and adjustments to compute  our share of fad from our unconsolidated joint ventures and those related to ccrc nonrefundable entrance fees certain prior period amounts in the “nongaap financial measures reconciliation” below for fad have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation more specifically we have combined whollyowned and our share from unconsolidated joint ventures recurring capital expenditures including leasing costs and second generation tenant and capital improvements fad capital expenditures into a single line item in addition we have combined cash ccrc jv entrance fees with ccrc jv entrance fee amortization into a single line item separately disclosed deferred income taxes previously reported in “other” and collapsed immaterial line items into ‘other’ adjustments for joint ventures are calculated to reflect our prorata share of both our consolidated and unconsolidated joint ventures we reflect our share of fad for unconsolidated joint ventures by applying our actual ownership percentage for the period to the applicable reconciling items on an entity by entity basis we reflect our share for consolidated joint ventures in which we do not own 100 of the equity by adjusting our fad to remove the third party ownership share of the applicable reconciling items based on actual 

ownership percentage for the applicable periods see ffo above for further disclosure regarding our use of prorata share information and its limitations other reits or real estate companies may use different methodologies for calculating fad and accordingly our fad may not be comparable to those reported by other reits although our fad computation may not be comparable to that of other reits management believes fad provides a meaningful supplemental measure of our performance and is frequently used by analysts investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of our performance as a reit we believe fad is an alternative runrate earnings measure that improves the understanding of our operating results among investors and makes comparisons with i expected results ii results of previous periods and iii results among reits more meaningful fad does not represent cash generated from operating activities determined in accordance with gaap and is not necessarily indicative of cash available to fund cash needs as it excludes the following items which generally flow through our cash flows from operating activities i adjustments for changes in working capital or the actual timing of the payment of income or expense items that are accrued in the period ii transactionrelated costs iii litigation settlement expenses iv severancerelated expenses and v actual cash receipts from interest income recognized on loans receivable in contrast to our fad adjustment to exclude noncash interest and depreciation related to our investments in direct financing leases furthermore fad is adjusted for recurring capital expenditures which are generally not considered when determining cash flows from operations or liquidity fad is a nongaap supplemental financial measure and should not be considered as an alternative to net income loss determined in accordance with gaap for a reconciliation of net income loss to fad and other relevant disclosure refer to “nongaap financial measures reconciliations” below

during the year ended december 31 2016 we sold a portfolio of five facilities in one of our nonreportable segments and two senior housing triplenet facilities for 130 million five life science facilities for 386 million seven senior housing triplenet facilities for 88 million three mobs for 20 million and three shop facilities for 41 million recognizing total gain on sales of 165 million 

during the year ended december 31 2015 we sold the following assets i nine senior housing triplenet facilities for 60 million resulting from brookdale’s exercise of its purchase option and ii a mob for 04 million recognizing total gain on sales of 6 million 

loss on debt extinguishments   during the year ended december 31 2017 we repurchased 500 million of our 5375 senior notes due 2021 and recognized a 54 million loss on debt extinguishment primarily related to a premium for early payment 

during the fourth quarter of 2016 using proceeds from the spinoff we repaid 11 billion of senior unsecured notes that were due to mature in january 2017 and january 2018 and repaid 108 million of mortgage debt incurring aggregate loss on debt extinguishments of 46 million primarily related to prepayment penalties 

other income expense net   the increase in other income net for the year ended december 31 2017  was primarily as a result of the £42 million 51 million gain on sale of our four seasons notes partially offset by 12 million of casualtyrelated charges due to hurricanes in the third quarter of 2017 and 13 million of increased litigationrelated expenses including costs from securities class action litigation and a legal settlement in 2017 

the decrease in other income net for the year ended december 31 2016  was primarily the result of a reduction of foreign currency remeasurement gains from remeasuring assets and liabilities denominated in gbp to us dollars “usd” as a result of effective hedges designated in september 2015 

income tax benefit expense   the increase in income tax benefit for the year ended december 31 2017  was primarily the result of i a 6 million income tax benefit from the partial sale of ridea ii in 2017 ii a 5 million income tax benefit related to our share of operating losses from our ridea joint ventures iii a 1 million deferred tax benefit from casualtyrelated charges recognized in the second half of 2017 and iv a 11 million income tax expense recognized in 2016 associated with federal income tax and state builtin gain tax for the disposition of certain real estate assets the total tax benefit was partially offset by a 17 million income tax expense related to the impact of tax rate legislation during the fourth quarter of 2017 

the increase in income tax expense for the year ended december 31 2016  was primarily the result of recognizing tax liabilities representing state builtin gain tax for the disposition of certain real estate assets 

equity income loss from unconsolidated joint ventures   the decrease in equity income from unconsolidated joint ventures for the year ended december 31 2017  was   primarily the result of income from our share of gains on sales of real estate in 2016 partially offset by income from our investment in ridea ii which was deconsolidated in the first quarter of 2017 

the increase in equity income from unconsolidated joint ventures for the year ended december 31 2016  was primarily the result of increased income from our share of gains on sales of real estate 

total discontinued operations   discontinued operations for the years ended december 31 2016 and 2015 resulted in income of 266 million and loss of 699 million respectively income and loss from discontinued operations primarily relates to the operations of qcp income from discontinued operations increased during the year ended december 31 2016 as a result of impairment charges during 2015 not repeated in 2016 the increase in discontinued operations was partially offset by the following i a reduction in income from our hcrmc investments as a result of the hcrmc lease amendment effective april 1 2015 the sale of nonstrategic assets during the second half of 2015 and the first half of 2016 and a change in income recognition to a cash basis method beginning in january 2016 ii transaction costs of 87 million related to the spinoff and iii increased income tax expense related to our estimated exposure to state builtin gain tax during the year ended december 31 2015 we recognized impairments of 13 billion related to our hcrmc portfolio there were no discontinued operations for the year ended december 31 2017 

liquidity and capital resources 

we anticipate that our cash flow from operations available cash balances and cash from our various financing activities will be adequate for at least the next 12 months for purposes of i funding recurring operating expenses ii meeting debt service requirements including principal payments and maturities and iii satisfying our distributions to our stockholders and noncontrolling interest members 

our principal investing liquidity needs for the next 12 months are to 

 we anticipate satisfying these future investing needs using one or more of the following 

 access to capital markets impacts our cost of capital and ability to refinance maturing indebtedness as well as our ability to fund future acquisitions and development through the issuance of additional securities or secured debt credit ratings impact our ability to access capital and directly impact our cost of capital as well for example our revolving line of credit facility accrues interest at a rate per annum equal to libor plus a margin that depends upon our credit ratings we also pay a facility fee on the entire revolving commitment that depends upon our credit ratings as of january 31 2018 we had a credit rating of bbb from fitch baa2 from moody’s and bbb from sp global on our senior unsecured debt securities 

cash flow summary 

during the fourth quarter of 2017 we adopted accounting standards update asu no 201618 restricted cash  and asu no 201615 classification of certain cash receipts and cash payments  using the full retrospective approach see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information the following summary discussion of our cash flows is based on the consolidated statements of cash flows and is not meant to be an allinclusive discussion of the changes in our cash flows for the periods presented below

debt 

see note 10 in the consolidated financial statements for information about our outstanding debt 

see “2017 transaction overview” for further information regarding our significant financing activities during the year ended december 31 2017 

equity 

at december 31 2017  we had 469 million  shares of common stock outstanding equity totaled 56 billion  and our equity securities had a market value of 124 billion  

at december 31 2017  nonmanaging members held an aggregate of 4 million  units in five  limited liability companies “downreits” for which we are the managing member the downreit units are exchangeable for an amount of cash approximating the thencurrent market value of shares of our common stock or at our option shares of our common stock subject to certain adjustments such as stock splits and reclassifications 

atthemarket program   in june 2015 we established an atthemarket program in connection with the renewal of our shelf registration statement under this program we may sell shares of our common stock from time to time having an aggregate gross sales price of up to 750 million through a consortium of banks acting as sales agents or directly to the banks acting as principals there was no activity during the year ended december 31 2017  and as of december 31 2017  shares of our common stock having an aggregate gross sales price of 676 million were available for sale under the atthemarket program actual future sales will depend upon a variety of factors including but not limited to market conditions the trading price of our common stock and our capital needs we have no obligation to sell the remaining shares available for sale under our program 

shelf registration 

we filed a prospectus with the sec as part of a registration statement on form s3asr using a shelf registration process our current shelf registration statement expires in june 2018 we expect to file a new shelf registration statement on or before such time under the “shelf” process we may sell any combination of the securities described in the prospectus through one or more offerings the securities described in the prospectus include common stock preferred stock depositary shares debt securities and warrants 

contractual obligations 

the following table summarizes our material contractual payment obligations and commitments at december 31 2017  in thousands 



 



offbalance sheet arrangements 

we own interests in certain unconsolidated joint ventures as described in note 8 to the consolidated financial statements except in limited circumstances our risk of loss is limited to our investment in the joint venture and any outstanding loans receivable in addition we have certain properties which serve as collateral for debt that is owed by a previous owner of certain of our facilities as described under note 11 to the consolidated financial statements our risk of loss for these certain properties is limited to the outstanding debt balance plus penalties if any we have no other material offbalance sheet arrangements that we expect would materially affect our liquidity and capital resources except those described above under “contractual obligations” 

inflation 

our leases often provide for either fixed increases in base rents or indexed escalators based on the consumer price index or other measures andor additional rent based on increases in the tenants’ operating revenues most of our mob leases require the tenant to pay a share of property operating costs such as real estate taxes insurance and utilities substantially all of our senior housing life science and remaining other leases require the tenant or operator to pay all of the property operating costs or reimburse us for all such costs we believe that inflationary increases in expenses will be offset in part by the tenant or operator expense reimbursements and contractual rent increases described above

critical accounting policies 

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us gaap requires our management to use judgment in the application of accounting policies including making estimates and assumptions we base estimates on the best information available to us at the time our experience and on various other assumptions believed to be reasonable under the circumstances these estimates affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods if our judgment or interpretation of the facts and circumstances relating to various transactions or other matters had been different it is possible that different accounting would have been applied resulting in a different presentation of our consolidated financial statements from time to time we reevaluate our estimates and assumptions in the event estimates or assumptions prove to be different from actual results adjustments are made in subsequent periods to reflect more current estimates and assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain for a more detailed discussion of our significant accounting policies see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements below is a discussion of accounting policies that we consider critical in that they may require complex judgment in their application or require estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain 

principles of consolidation 

the consolidated financial statements include the accounts of hcp inc our whollyowned subsidiaries and joint ventures that we control through voting rights or other means we consolidate investments in variable interest entities “vies” when we are the primary beneficiary of the vie a variable interest holder is considered to be the primary beneficiary of a vie if it has the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the entity’s economic performance and has the obligation to absorb losses of or the right to receive benefits from the entity that could potentially be significant to the vie 

we make judgments about which entities are vies based on an assessment of whether i the equity investors as a group do not have a controlling financial interest ii the equity investment at risk is insufficient to finance that entity’s activities without additional subordinated financial support or iii substantially all of the entity’s activities involve or are performed on behalf of an equity investor that holds disproportionately few voting rights we make judgments with respect to our level of influence or control over an entity and whether we are or are not the primary beneficiary of a vie consideration of various factors includes but is not limited to our ability to direct the activities that most significantly impact the entity’s economic performance our form of ownership interest our representation on the entity’s governing body the size and seniority of our investment and our ability and the rights of other investors to participate in policy making decisions replace the manager andor liquidate the entity if applicable our ability to correctly assess our influence or control over an entity when determining the primary beneficiary of a vie affects the presentation of these entities in our consolidated financial statements when we perform a reanalysis of the primary beneficiary at a date other than at inception of the vie our assumptions may be different and may result in the identification of a different primary beneficiary 

if we determine that we are the primary beneficiary of a vie our consolidated financial statements include the operating results of the vie rather than the results of our variable interest in the vie we require vies to provide us timely financial information and review the internal controls of vies to determine if we can rely on the financial information it provides if a vie has deficiencies in its internal controls over financial reporting or does not provide us with timely financial information it may adversely impact the quality andor timing of our financial reporting and our internal controls over financial reporting 

revenue recognition 

at the inception of a new lease arrangement including new leases that arise from amendments we assess the terms and conditions to determine the proper lease classification a lease arrangement is classified as an operating lease if none of the following criteria are met i transfer of ownership to the lessee prior to or shortly after the end of the lease term ii the lessee has a bargain purchase option during or at the end of the lease term iii the lease term is equal to 75 or more of the underlying property’s economic life or iv the present value of future minimum lease payments excluding executory costs is equal to 90 or more of the estimated fair value of the leased asset if one of the four criteria is met and the minimum lease payments are determined to be reasonably predictable and collectible the lease arrangement is generally accounted for as a dfl if the assumptions utilized in the above classifications assessments were different our lease classification for accounting purposes may have been different thus the timing and amount of our revenue recognized would have been impacted which may be material to our consolidated financial statements 

we recognize rental revenue for operating leases on a straightline basis over the lease term when collectibility of all minimum lease payments is reasonably assured and the tenant has taken possession or controls the physical use of a leased asset if the lease provides for tenant improvements we determine whether the tenant improvements are owned by the tenant or us when we are the owner of the tenant improvements the tenant is not considered to have taken physical possession or have control of the leased 

asset until the tenant improvements are substantially complete when the tenant is the owner of the tenant improvements any tenant improvement allowance funded is treated as a lease incentive and amortized as a reduction of revenue over the lease term the determination of ownership of a tenant improvement is subject to significant judgment if our assessment of the owner of the tenant improvements was different the timing and amount of our revenue recognized would be impacted 

certain leases provide for additional rents that are contingent upon a percentage of the facility’s revenue in excess of specified base amounts or other thresholds such revenue is recognized when actual results reported by the tenant or estimates of tenant results exceed the base amount or other thresholds the recognition of additional rents requires us to make estimates of amounts owed and to a certain extent is dependent on the accuracy of the facility results reported to us our estimates may differ from actual results which could be material to our consolidated financial statements 

we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts including an allowance for operating lease straightline rent receivables for estimated losses resulting from tenant defaults or the inability of tenants to make contractual rent and tenant recovery payments we monitor the liquidity and creditworthiness of our tenants and operators on a continuous basis this evaluation considers industry and economic conditions property performance credit enhancements and other factors for straightline rent receivable amounts our assessment is based on income recoverable over the term of the lease we exercise judgment in establishing allowances and consider payment history and current credit status in developing these estimates these estimates may differ from actual results which could be material to our consolidated financial statements 

we use the direct finance method of accounting to record income from dfls for leases accounted for as dfls the net investment in the dfl represents receivables for the sum of future minimum lease payments receivable and the estimated residual values of the leased properties less the unamortized unearned income unearned income is deferred and amortized to income over the lease terms to provide a constant yield when collectibility of the lease payments is reasonably assured the determination of estimated useful lives and residual values are subject to significant judgment if these assessments were to change the timing and amount of our revenue recognized would be impacted 

loans receivable are classified as heldforinvestment based on management’s intent and ability to hold the loans for the foreseeable future or to maturity we recognize interest income on loans including the amortization of discounts and premiums using the interest method applied on a loanbyloan basis when collectibility of the future payments is reasonably assured premiums discounts and related costs are recognized as yield adjustments over the term of the related loans if management determined that certain loans should no longer be classified as heldforinvestment the timing and amount of our interest income recognized would be impacted 

loans receivable and dfls collectively “finance receivables” are reviewed and assigned an internal rating of performing watch list or workout finance receivables that are deemed performing meet all present contractual obligations and collection and timing of all amounts owed is reasonably assured watch list finance receivables are defined as finance receivables that do not meet the definition of performing or workout workout finance receivables are defined as finance receivables in which we have determined based on current information and events that i it is probable we will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the agreement ii the tenant operator or borrower is delinquent on making payments under the contractual terms of the agreement and iii we have commenced action or anticipate pursuing action in the near term to seek recovery of our investment 

finance receivables are placed on nonaccrual status when management determines that the collectibility of contractual amounts is not reasonably assured the asset will have an internal rating of either watch list or workout further we perform a credit analysis to support the tenant’s operator’s borrower’s andor guarantor’s repayment capacity and the underlying collateral values we use the cash basis method of accounting for finance receivables placed on nonaccrual status unless one of the following conditions exist whereby we utilize the cost recovery method of accounting i if we determine that it is probable that we will only recover the recorded investment in the finance receivable net of associated allowances or chargeoffs if any or ii we cannot reasonably estimate the amount of an impaired finance receivable for cash basis method of accounting we apply payments received excluding principal paydowns to interest income so long as that amount does not exceed the amount that would have been earned under the original contractual terms for cost recovery method of accounting any payment received is applied to reduce the recorded investment generally we return a finance receivable to accrual status when all delinquent payments become current under the terms of the loan or lease agreements and collectibility of the remaining contractual loan or lease payments is reasonably assured 

allowances are established for finance receivables on an individual basis utilizing an estimate of probable losses if they are determined to be impaired finance receivables are impaired when it is deemed probable that we will be unable to collect all amounts due in accordance with the contractual terms of the loan or lease an allowance is based upon our assessment of the lessee’s or borrower’s overall financial condition economic resources payment record the prospects for support from any financially responsible guarantors and if appropriate the net realizable value of any collateral these estimates consider all 

available evidence including the expected future cash flows discounted at the finance receivable’s effective interest rate fair value of collateral general economic conditions and trends historical and industry loss experience and other relevant factors as appropriate should a finance receivable be deemed partially or wholly uncollectible the uncollectible balance is charged off against the allowance in the period in which the uncollectible determination has been made 

real estate 

we make estimates as part of our process for allocating a purchase price to the various identifiable assets of an acquisition based upon the relative fair value of each asset the most significant components of our allocations are typically buildings asifvacant land and inplace leases in the case of allocating fair value to buildings and intangibles our fair value estimates will affect the amount of depreciation and amortization we record over the estimated useful life of each asset acquired in the case of allocating fair value to inplace leases we make our best estimates based on our evaluation of the specific characteristics of each tenant’s lease factors considered include estimates of carrying costs during hypothetical expected leaseup periods market conditions and costs to execute similar leases our assumptions affect the amount of future revenue andor depreciation and amortization expense that we will recognize over the remaining lease term for the acquired inplace leases 

a variety of costs are incurred in the development and leasing of properties after determination is made to capitalize a cost it is allocated to the specific component of a project that is benefited determination of when a development project is substantially complete and capitalization must cease involves a degree of judgment the costs of land and buildings under development include specifically identifiable costs the capitalized costs include preconstruction costs essential to the development of the property development costs construction costs interest costs real estate taxes and other costs incurred during the period of development we consider a construction project to be considered substantially complete and available for occupancy and cease capitalization of costs upon the completion of the related tenant improvements 

impairment of longlived assets 

we assess the carrying value of our real estate assets and related intangibles “real estate assets” when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the real estate assets may not be recoverable but at least annually recoverability of real estate assets is measured by comparing the carrying amount of the real estate assets to the respective estimated future undiscounted cash flows the estimated future undiscounted cash flows are calculated utilizing the lowest level of identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities in order to review our real estate assets for recoverability we consider market conditions as well as our intent with respect to holding or disposing of the asset if our analysis indicates that the carrying value of the real estate assets is not recoverable on an undiscounted cash flow basis we recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the real estate asset 

the determination of the fair value of real estate assets involves significant judgment this judgment is based on our analysis and estimates of fair value of real estate assets future operating results and resulting cash flows of each real estate asset whose carrying amount may not be recoverable our ability to accurately predict future operating results and resulting cash flows and estimate and allocate fair values impacts the timing and recognition of impairments while we believe our assumptions are reasonable changes in these assumptions may have a material impact on our financial results 

investments in unconsolidated joint ventures 

the initial carrying value of investments in unconsolidated joint ventures is based on the amount paid to purchase the joint venture interest or the carrying value of the assets prior to the sale or contribution of the interests to the joint venture we evaluate our equity method investments for impairment by first reviewing for indicators of impairment based upon the performance of the underlying real estate assets held by the joint venture if an equity method investment shows indicators of impairment we compare the fair value of the equity method investment to our carrying value if we determine there is a decline in the fair value of our investment in an unconsolidated joint venture below its carrying value and it is otherthantemporary an impairment is recorded the determination of the fair value of investments in unconsolidated joint ventures and as to whether a deficiency in fair value is otherthantemporary involves significant judgment our estimates consider all available evidence including as appropriate the present value of the expected future cash flows discounted at market rates general economic conditions and trends severity and duration of a fair value deficiency and other relevant factors capitalization rates discount rates and credit spreads utilized in our valuation models are based upon rates that we believe to be within a reasonable range of current market rates for the respective investments while we believe our assumptions are reasonable changes in these assumptions may have a material impact on our financial results 

income taxes 

as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements significant management judgment is required to evaluate our compliance with reit requirements our determinations are based on interpretation of tax laws and our conclusions may have an impact on the income tax expense recognized adjustments to income tax expense may be required as a result of i audits conducted by federal state and local tax authorities ii our ability to qualify as a reit iii the potential for builtin gain recognition and iv changes in tax laws adjustments required in any given period are included within the income tax provision

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

tableend we are exposed to various market risks including the potential loss arising from adverse changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates specifically the gbp we use derivative financial instruments in the normal course of business to mitigate interest rate and foreign currency risk we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes derivatives are recorded on the consolidated balance sheets at fair value see note 23 to the consolidated financial statements 

to illustrate the effect of movements in the interest rate and foreign currency markets we performed a market sensitivity analysis on our hedging instruments we applied various basis point spreads to the underlying interest rate curves and foreign currency exchange rates of the derivative portfolio in order to determine the change in fair value assuming a one percentage point change in the underlying interest rate curve and foreign currency exchange rates the estimated change in fair value of each of the underlying derivative instruments would not exceed 2 million  

interest rate risk 

at december 31 2017  we are exposed to market risks related to fluctuations in interest rates primarily on variable rate debt as of december 31 2017  44 million  of our variablerate debt was hedged by interest rate swap transactions the interest rate swaps are designated as cash flow hedges with the objective of managing the exposure to interest rate risk by converting the interest rates on our variablerate debt to fixed interest rates 

interest rate fluctuations will generally not affect our future earnings or cash flows on our fixed rate debt and assets until their maturity or earlier prepayment and refinancing if interest rates have risen at the time we seek to refinance our fixed rate debt whether at maturity or otherwise our future earnings and cash flows could adversely be affected by additional borrowing costs conversely lower interest rates at the time of refinancing may reduce our overall borrowing costs however interest rate changes will affect the fair value of our fixed rate instruments a one percentage point increase or decrease in interest rates would change the fair value of our fixed rate debt by approximately 332 million and 358 million respectively and would not materially impact earnings or cash flows a one percentage point increase or decrease in interest rates would change the fair value of our fixed rate debt investments by approximately 8 million and 9 million respectively and would not materially impact earnings or cash flows conversely changes in interest rates on variable rate debt and investments would change our future earnings and cash flows but not materially impact the fair value of those instruments assuming a one percentage point change in the interest rate related to our variablerate debt and variablerate investments and assuming no other changes in the outstanding balance as of december 31 2017  our annual interest expense and interest income would change by approximately 12 million  and 1 million  respectively 

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

at december 31 2017  our exposure to foreign currencies primarily relates to uk investments in leased real estate and related gbp denominated cash flows our foreign currency exposure is partially mitigated through the use of gbp denominated borrowings and foreign currency swap contracts based solely on our operating results for the year ended december 31 2017  including the impact of existing hedging arrangements if the value of the gbp relative to the us dollar were to increase or decrease by 10 compared to the average exchange rate during the year ended december 31 2017 the increase or decrease to our cash flows would not be material 

market risk 

we have investments in marketable debt securities classified as heldtomaturity because we have the positive intent and ability to hold the securities to maturity heldtomaturity securities are recorded at amortized cost and adjusted for the amortization of premiums and discounts through maturity we consider a variety of factors in evaluating an otherthantemporary decline in value such as the length of time and the extent to which the market value has been less than our current adjusted carrying value the issuer’s financial condition capital strength and nearterm prospects any recent events specific to that issuer and economic conditions of its industry and our investment horizon in relationship to an anticipated nearterm recovery in the market value if any at december 31 2017  both the fair value and carrying value of marketable debt securities were 19 million

for a description of our significant activities during 2016 see item 7 in this report 

  

business strategy 

we invest and manage our real estate portfolio for the longterm to maximize the benefit to our stockholders and support the growth of our dividends the core elements of our strategy are i to acquire develop lease own and manage a diversified portfolio of quality healthcare properties across multiple geographic locations and business segments including senior housing medical office and life science among others ii to align ourselves with leading healthcare companies operators and service providers which over the longterm should result in higher relative rental rates net operating cash flows and appreciation of property values iii to maintain adequate liquidity with longterm fixed rate debt financing with staggered maturities which supports the longerterm nature of our investments while reducing our exposure to interest rate volatility and refinancing risk at any point in the interest rate or credit cycles and iv to continue to manage our balance sheet with a targeted financial leverage of 40 relative to our assets  

internal growth strategies 

we believe our real estate portfolio holds the potential for increased future cash flows as it is wellmaintained and in desirable locations within markets where new supply is generally limited by the lack of available sites and the difficulty of obtaining the necessary licensing other approvals andor financing our strategy for maximizing the benefits from these opportunities is to i work with new or existing tenants and operators to address their space and capital needs and ii provide highquality property management services in order to motivate tenants to renew expand or relocate into our properties 

we expect to continue our internal growth as a result of our ability to 





 



investment strategies 

the delivery of healthcare services requires real estate and as a result tenants and operators depend on real estate in part to maintain and grow their businesses we believe that the healthcare real estate market provides investment opportunities due to the i compelling longterm demographics driving the demand for healthcare services ii specialized nature of healthcare real estate investing and iii ongoing consolidation of the fragmented healthcare real estate sector  

while we emphasize healthcare real estate ownership we may also provide real estate secured financing to or invest in equity or debt securities of healthcare operators or other entities engaged in healthcare real estate ownership we may also acquire all or substantially all of the securities or assets of other reits operating companies or similar entities where such investments would be consistent with our investment strategies we may coinvest alongside institutional or development investors through partnerships or limited liability companies 

we monitor but do not limit our investments based on the percentage of our total assets that may be invested in any one property type investment vehicle or geographic location the number of properties that may be leased to a single tenant or operator or loans that may be made to a single borrower in allocating capital we target opportunities with the most attractive riskreward profile for our portfolio as a whole we may take additional measures to mitigate risk including diversifying our investments by sector geography tenant or operator structuring transactions as master leases requiring tenant or operator insurance and indemnifications and obtaining credit enhancements in the form of guarantees letters of credit or security deposits 

we believe we are wellpositioned to achieve external growth through acquisitions financing and development other factors that contribute to our competitive position include 

  













financing strategies 

our reit qualification requires us to distribute at least 90 of our reit taxable income excluding net capital gains therefore we don’t retain a significant amount of capital as a result we regularly access the public equity and debt markets to raise the funds necessary to finance acquisitions and debt investments develop and redevelop properties and refinance maturing debt   

we may finance acquisitions and other investments through the following vehicles 





 





we maintain a disciplined balance sheet by actively managing our debt to equity levels and maintaining multiple sources of liquidity our debt obligations are primarily longterm fixed rate with staggered maturities 

we finance our investments based on our evaluation of available sources of funding for shortterm purposes we may utilize our revolving line of credit facility or arrange for other shortterm borrowings from banks or other sources we arrange for longerterm financing by offering debt and equity securities placing mortgage debt and obtaining capital from institutional lenders and joint venture partners 

  

segments 

the following table summarizes our revenues by segment in thousands 



senior housing sh nnn and shop our senior housing facilities are managed utilizing triplenet leases and ridea structures which are permitted by the housing and economic recovery act of 2008 commonly referred to as “ridea” and include independent living facilities “ilfs” assisted living facilities “alfs” memory care facilities “mcfs” care homes and continuing care retirement communities “ccrcs” which cater to different segments of the elderly population based upon their personal needs services provided by our tenants or operators in these facilities are primarily paid for by the residents directly or through private insurance and are less reliant on government reimbursement programs such as medicare and medicaid 

we have entered into longterm agreements with operators including brookdale senior living inc “brookdale” to operate and manage properties that are operated under a ridea structure under the provisions of ridea a reit may lease a “qualified healthcare property” on an arm’s length basis to a taxable reit subsidiary “trs” if the property is managed on behalf of such subsidiary by a person who qualifies as an “eligible independent contractor” ridea structures allow us to own the risks and rewards of the operations of healthcare facilities as compared to leasing the property for contractual triplenet rents in a tax efficient manner we view ridea as a structure primarily to be used on properties that present attractive valuation entry points andor growth profiles by i transitioning the asset to a new operator that can bring scale operating efficiencies andor ancillary services or ii investing capital to reposition the asset brookdale provides comprehensive facility management and accounting services with respect to a majority of our senior housing ridea properties for which we pay annual management fees pursuant to the aforementioned agreements most of the management agreements have terms ranging from 10 to 15 years with three to four 5year renewals the base management fees are 45 to 50 of gross revenues as defined generated by the ridea facilities in addition there are incentive management fees payable to brookdale if operating results of the ridea properties exceed preestablished ebitdar defined as earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization and rent thresholds 

our senior housing property types under both triplenet leases and ridea structures are further described below 



 







the following table provides information about our sh nnn tenant concentration for the year ended december 31 2016 





as of december 31 2016 brookdale managed or operated in our shop segment approximately 18 of our real estate investments based on gross assets because an operator manages our facilities in exchange for the receipt of a management fee we are not directly exposed to the credit risk of the operators in the same manner or to the same extent as our triplenet tenants however adverse developments in their business and affairs or financial condition could impair their ability to efficiently and effectively manage our facilities 

life science these properties contain laboratory and office space primarily for biotechnology medical device and pharmaceutical companies scientific research institutions government agencies and other organizations involved in the life science industry while these properties have characteristics similar to commercial office buildings they generally contain more advanced electrical mechanical and heating ventilating and air conditioning “hvac” systems the facilities generally have specialty equipment including emergency generators fume hoods lab bench tops and related amenities in many instances life science tenants make significant investments to improve their leased space in addition to landlord improvements to accommodate biology chemistry or medical device research initiatives 

life science properties are primarily configured in business park or campus settings and include multiple buildings the business park and campus settings allow us the opportunity to provide flexible contiguousadjacent expansion to accommodate the growth of existing tenants our properties are located in wellestablished geographical markets known for scientific research and drug discovery including san francisco and san diego california and durham north carolina at december 31 2016 97 of our life science properties were triplenet leased based on leased square feet 

 

the following table provides information about our life science tenant concentration for the year ended december 31 2016 





  

medical office medical office buildings “mobs” typically contain physicians’ offices and examination rooms and may also include pharmacies hospital ancillary service space and outpatient services such as diagnostic centers rehabilitation clinics and daysurgery operating rooms while these facilities are similar to commercial office buildings they require additional plumbing electrical and mechanical systems to accommodate multiple exam rooms that may require sinks in every room and special equipment such as xray machines in addition mobs are often built to accommodate higher structural loads for certain equipment and may contain vaults or other specialized construction our mobs are typically multitenant properties leased to healthcare providers hospitals and physician practices with approximately 82 of our mobs based on square feet located on hospital campuses and 95 are affiliated with hospital systems occasionally we invest in mobs located on hospital campuses which may be subject to ground leases at december 31 2016 approximately 53 of our medical office buildings were triplenet leased based on leased square feet with the remaining leased under gross or modified gross leases 

the following table provides information about our medical office tenant concentration for the year ended december 31 2016 





  

other nonreportable segments at december 31 2016 we had interests in and managed 15 hospitals 61 care homes in the united kingdom “uk” five postacuteskilled nursing facilities “snfs” 4 of which were owned by our unconsolidated joint ventures and 877 million of debt investments services provided by our tenants and operators in hospitals are paid for by private sources thirdparty payors eg insurance and hmos or through medicare and medicaid programs our hospital property types include acute care longterm acute care specialty and rehabilitation hospitals care homes offer personal care services such as lodging meal services housekeeping and laundry services medication management and assistance with adl care homes are registered to provide different levels of services ranging from personal care to nursing care some homes can be further registered for a specific care need such as dementia or terminal illness snfs offer restorative rehabilitative and custodial nursing care for people following a hospital stay or not requiring the more extensive and complex treatment available at hospitals all of our care homes in the uk hospitals and snfs are triplenet leased 

  

competition 

investing in real estate serving the healthcare industry is highly competitive we face competition from other reits investment companies pension funds private equity and hedge fund investors sovereign funds healthcare operators lenders developers and other institutional investors some of whom may have greater flexibility eg nonreit competitors resources and lower costs of capital than we do increased competition makes it more challenging for us to identify and successfully capitalize on opportunities that meet our objectives our ability to compete may also be impacted by global national and local economic trends availability of investment alternatives availability and cost of capital construction and renovation costs existing laws and regulations new legislation and population trends 

income from our investments depends on our tenants’ and operators’ ability to compete with other companies on multiple levels including the quality of care provided reputation success of product or drug development the physical appearance 

 

of a facility price and range of services offered alternatives for healthcare delivery the supply of competing properties physicians staff referral sources location the size and demographics of the population in surrounding areas and the financial condition of our tenants and operators for a discussion of the risks associated with competitive conditions affecting our business see “item 1a risk factors” in this report 

  

government regulation licensing and enforcement 

overview 

our tenants and operators are typically subject to extensive and complex federal state and local healthcare laws and regulations relating to quality of care licensure and certificate of need government reimbursement fraud and abuse practices and similar laws governing the operation of healthcare facilities and we expect that the healthcare industry in general will continue to face increased regulation and pressure in the areas of fraud waste and abuse cost control healthcare management and provision of services among others these regulations are wide ranging and can subject our tenants and operators to civil criminal and administrative sanctions affected tenants and operators may find it increasingly difficult to comply with this complex and evolving regulatory environment because of a relative lack of guidance in many areas as certain of our healthcare properties are subject to oversight from several government agencies and the laws may vary from one jurisdiction to another changes in laws regulations reimbursement enforcement activity and regulatory noncompliance by our tenants and operators can all have a significant effect on their operations and financial condition which in turn may adversely impact us as detailed below and set forth under “item 1a risk factors” in this report 

based on information primarily provided by our tenants and operators including our medical office segment at december 31 2016 we estimate that approximately 13 and 12 15 and 14 excluding our medical office segment of the annualized base rental payments received from our tenants and operators were dependent on medicare and medicaid reimbursement respectively 

the following is a discussion of certain laws and regulations generally applicable to our operators and in certain cases to us 

fraud and abuse enforcement 

there are various extremely complex us federal and state laws and regulations and in relation to our facilities located in the uk national laws and regulations of england scotland northern ireland and wales governing healthcare providers’ relationships and arrangements and prohibiting fraudulent and abusive practices by such providers these laws include i us federal state false claims acts and uk antifraud legislation and regulation which among other things prohibit providers from filing false claims or making false statements to receive payment from medicare medicaid or other us federal or state or uk healthcare programs ii us federal state antikickback and feesplitting statutes including the medicare and medicaid antikickback statute which prohibit or restrict the payment or receipt of remuneration to induce referrals or recommendations of healthcare items or services and uk legislation and regulations on financial inducements and vested interests iii us federal and state physician selfreferral laws commonly referred to as the “stark law” which generally prohibit referrals by physicians to entities with which the physician or an immediate family member has a financial relationship iv the federal civil monetary penalties law which prohibits among other things the knowing presentation of a false or fraudulent claim for certain healthcare services and v us federal state and uk privacy laws including the privacy and security rules contained in the health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 commonly referred to as “hipaa” and the uk data protection act 1988 which provide for the privacy and security of personal health information violations of us and uk healthcare fraud and abuse laws carry civil criminal and administrative sanctions including punitive sanctions monetary penalties imprisonment denial of medicare and medicaid reimbursement and potential exclusion from medicare medicaid or other federal or state healthcare programs these laws are enforced by a variety of federal state and local agencies and in the us can also be enforced by private litigants through among other things federal and state false claims acts which allow private litigants to bring qui tam or “whistleblower” actions many of our tenants and operators are subject to these laws and may become the subject of governmental enforcement actions if they fail to comply with applicable laws 

 

reimbursement 

sources of revenue for many of our tenants and operators include among others governmental healthcare programs such as the federal medicare programs and state medicaid programs and in the uk the national health service “nhs” and local authority funding and nongovernmental thirdparty payors such as insurance carriers and hmos as federal and state governments focus on healthcare reform initiatives and as the federal government many states face significant current and future budget deficits efforts to reduce costs by these payors will likely continue which may result in reduced or slower growth in reimbursement for certain services provided by some of our tenants and operators similarly in the uk the nhs and the local authorities are undertaking efforts to reduce costs which may result in reduced or slower growth in reimbursement for certain services provided by our uk tenants and operators additionally new and evolving payor and provider programs in the us including but not limited to medicare advantage dual eligible accountable care organizations “aco” and bundled payments could adversely impact our tenants’ and operators’ liquidity financial condition or results of operations 

healthcare licensure and certificate of need 

certain healthcare facilities in our portfolio including our facilities located in the uk are subject to extensive national federal state and local licensure certification and inspection laws and regulations in addition various licenses and permits are required to handle controlled substances including narcotics operate pharmacies handle radioactive materials and operate equipment many states in the us require certain healthcare providers to obtain a certificate of need which requires prior approval for the construction expansion or closure of certain healthcare facilities the approval process related to state certificate of need laws may impact some of our tenants’ and operators’ abilities to expand or change their businesses 

life science facilities 

while certain of our life science tenants include some wellestablished companies other tenants are less established and in some cases may not yet have a product approved by the food and drug administration or other regulatory authorities for commercial sale creating a new pharmaceutical product or medical device requires substantial investments of time and capital in part because of the extensive regulation of the healthcare industry it also entails considerable risk of failure in demonstrating that the product is safe and effective and in gaining regulatory approval and market acceptance 

senior housing entrance fee communities 

certain of our senior housing facilities are operated as entrance fee communities generally an entrance fee is an upfront fee or consideration paid by a resident a portion of which may be refundable in exchange for some form of longterm benefit some of the entrance fee communities are subject to significant state regulatory oversight including for example oversight of each facility’s financial condition establishment and monitoring of reserve requirements and other financial restrictions the right of residents to cancel their contracts within a specified period of time lien rights in favor of the residents restrictions on change of ownership and similar matters 

americans with disabilities act the “ada” 

our properties must comply with the ada and any similar state or local laws to the extent that such properties are “public accommodations” as defined in those statutes the ada may require removal of barriers to access by persons with disabilities in certain public areas of our properties where such removal is readily achievable to date we have not received any notices of noncompliance with the ada that have caused us to incur substantial capital expenditures to address ada concerns should barriers to access by persons with disabilities be discovered at any of our properties we may be directly or indirectly responsible for additional costs that may be required to make facilities adacompliant noncompliance with the ada could result in the imposition of fines or an award of damages to private litigants the obligation to make readily achievable accommodations pursuant to the ada is an ongoing one and we continue to assess our properties and make modifications as appropriate in this respect 

environmental matters 

a wide variety of federal state and local environmental and occupational health and safety laws and regulations affect healthcare facility operations these complex federal and state statutes and their enforcement involve a myriad of regulations many of which involve strict liability on the part of the potential offender some of these federal and state statutes may directly impact us under various federal state and local environmental laws ordinances and regulations an 

 

owner of real property or a secured lender such as us may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of hazardous or toxic substances at under or disposed of in connection with such property as well as other potential costs relating to hazardous or toxic substances including government fines and damages for injuries to persons and adjacent property the cost of any required remediation removal fines or personal or property damages and any related liability therefore could exceed or impair the value of the property andor the assets in addition the presence of such substances or the failure to properly dispose of or remediate such substances may adversely affect the value of such property and the owner’s ability to sell or rent such property or to borrow using such property as collateral which in turn could reduce our earnings for a description of the risks associated with environmental matters see “item 1a risk factors” in this report 

  

insurance 

we obtain various types of insurance to mitigate the impact of property business interruption liability flood windstorm earthquake environmental and terrorism related losses we attempt to obtain appropriate policy terms conditions limits and deductibles considering the relative risk of loss the cost of such coverage and current industry practice there are however certain types of extraordinary losses such as those due to acts of war or other events that may be either uninsurable or not economically insurable in addition we have a large number of properties that are exposed to earthquake flood and windstorm occurrences which carry higher deductibles 

we maintain property insurance for all of our properties and this insurance is primary for our shop ridea life science and medical office segments tenants under triplenet leases primarily in our sh nnn segment are required to provide primary property business interruption and liability insurance we maintain separate general and professional liability insurance for our shop ridea facilities additionally our corporate general liability insurance program also extends coverage for all of our properties beyond the aforementioned we periodically review whether we or our ridea operators will bear responsibility for maintaining the required insurance coverage for the applicable shop properties but the costs of such insurance are facility expenses paid from the revenues of those properties regardless of who maintains the insurance 

we also maintain directors and officers liability insurance which provides protection for claims against our directors and officers arising from their responsibilities as directors and officers such insurance also extends to us in certain situations 

  

employees of hcp 

at december 31 2016 we had 188 fulltime employees none of whom were subject to a collective bargaining agreement 

  

sustainability 

we believe that sustainability initiatives are a vital part of corporate responsibility which supports our primary goal of increasing stockholder value through profitable growth we continue to advance our commitment to sustainability with a focus on achieving goals in each of the environmental social and governance “esg” dimensions of sustainability 

our environmental management programs strive to capture cost efficiencies that ultimately benefit our investors tenants operators employees and other stakeholders while providing a positive impact on the communities in which we operate our social responsibility team leads our local philanthropic and volunteer activities and our transparent corporate governance initiatives incorporate sustainability as a critical component to achieving our business objectives and properly managing risks 

 

our 2016 sustainability achievements include being named the healthcare leader in the light award winner by the national association of real estate investment trusts “nareit” and constituency in the ftse4good index series for the fifth consecutive year 

additionally we achieved constituency in the north america dow jones sustainability index “djsi” for the fourth consecutive year as well as the world djsi for the second time accordingly hcp was included in the sustainability yearbook a listing of the world’s most sustainable companies which includes only those companies in the top 15 of their industry as scored by the djsi assessment for additional information regarding our esg sustainability initiatives and our approach to climate change please visit our website at wwwhcpicomsustainability

 item 1a  risk factors   

the section below discusses the most significant risk factors that may materially adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

as set forth below we believe that the risks we face generally fall into the following categories 









  

  

risks related to our business and operations 

we depend on one tenant and operator brookdale for a significant percentage of our revenues and net operating income continuing adverse developments including operational challenges in brookdale’s business and affairs or financial condition would likely have a materially adverse effect on us 

we manage our facilities utilizing ridea and triplenet lease “lease arrangements” structures as of december 31 2016 brookdale leased or managed 212 senior housing facilities that we own and 16 shop facilities owned by our unconsolidated joint venture pursuant to longterm lease and management agreements 

  

properties managed by brookdale under ridea structures as of december 31 2016 accounted for 18 of our gross segment assets services provided by our managers in facilities managed under a ridea structure are primarily paid for by the residents directly or through private insurance and are less reliant on government reimbursement programs we report the resident level fees and services revenues and corresponding operating expenses in our consolidated financial statements 

  

 

in addition to our ridea structures with brookdale our leases with respect to brookdale as a tenant accounted for 12 of our revenues for the year ended december 31 2016 

  

although we have various rights as the property owner under our management agreements we rely on brookdale’s personnel expertise technical resources and information systems proprietary information good faith and judgment to manage our related senior living operations efficiently and effectively we also rely on brookdale to set appropriate resident fees manage occupancy provide accurate and complete propertylevel financial results for these senior housing communities in a timely manner and otherwise operate them in compliance with the terms of our management agreements and all applicable laws and regulations 

  

in its capacity as a manager in the ridea structures brookdale does not lease our properties and therefore our exposure to its credit risk is in a different manner as compared to a triplenet tenant brookdale has experienced significant challenges in integrating its july 2014 acquisition of emeritus corp and has been adversely affected by increased competition that has negatively impacted occupancy rates and in certain cases brookdale has offered additional discounts and incentives to residents brookdale as well as our other operators has also experienced labor expense pressure and increased labor turnover 

  

in its capacity as a triplenet tenant we depend on brookdale to pay all insurance tax utilities maintenance and repair expenses in connection with the leased properties we depend on adequate maintenance and repair of the properties to remain competitive and attract and retain patients and residents adverse developments in brookdale’s business and related declining rent coverage ratios have increased its credit risk if these adverse developments result in prolonged inadequate property maintenance or improvements or impair brookdale’s access to capital necessary for maintenance or improvements it could lead to a significant reduction in occupancy rates and market rents which would likely have a materially adverse effect on us 

  

brookdale’s operational challenges and potential adverse developments in its business affairs and financial results could significantly divert management’s attention increase employee turnover and impair its ability to manage the properties or its operations efficiently and effectively this could ultimately result in among other adverse events acceleration of brookdale’s indebtedness impairment of its continued access to capital the enforcement of default remedies by its counterparties or the commencement of insolvency proceedings by or against it under the us bankruptcy code 

  

in addition brookdale depends on private sources for its revenues and the ability of its patients and residents to pay its fees for example costs associated with independent and assisted living services are not generally reimbursable under governmental reimbursement programs such as medicare and medicaid accordingly brookdale depends on attracting seniors with appropriate levels of income and assets which may be affected by many factors including prevailing economic and market trends consumer confidence and demographics consequently if brookdale fails to effectively conduct its operations or to maintain and improve our properties it would adversely affect its business reputation and its ability to attract and retain patients and residents in our properties which would have a materially adverse effect on its and our business results of operations and financial condition 

  

brookdale also relies on reimbursements from governmental programs for a portion of its revenues changes in reimbursement policies and other governmental regulation such as potential changes to or repeal of the patient protection and affordable care act along with the health care and education reconciliation act of 2010 collectively the “affordable care act” that may result from the new presidential administration may result in reductions in brookdale’s revenues operations and cash flows and affect its ability to meet its obligations to us for a further discussion of the legislation and regulation that are applicable to us and our tenants operators and borrowers see “—legislation and regulation—the requirements of or changes to governmental reimbursement programs such as medicare or medicaid may adversely affect our tenants’ operators’ and borrowers’ ability to meet their financial and other contractual obligations to us” while brookdale generally has also agreed to indemnify us for various claims litigation and liabilities arising in connection with its business it may have insufficient assets income access to financing andor insurance coverage to enable them to satisfy its indemnification obligations 

  

 

the inability unwillingness or other failure of brookdale under its lease agreements and ridea structures to meet its obligations to us could materially reduce our cash flow net operating income and results of operations and have other materially adverse effects on our business results of operations and financial condition 

the bankruptcy insolvency or financial deterioration of one or more of our major tenants operators or borrowers may materially adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

we lease our properties directly to operators in most cases and in certain other cases we lease to third party tenants who enter into longterm management agreements with operators to manage the properties we are also a direct or indirect lender to various tenants and operators we have very limited control over the success or failure of our tenants’ and operators’ businesses any of our tenants or operators may experience a downturn in its business that materially weakens its financial condition as a result they may fail to make payments when due although we generally have arrangements and other agreements that give us the right under specified circumstances to terminate a lease evict a tenant or operator or demand immediate repayment of certain obligations to us we may determine not to do so if we believe that enforcement of our rights would be more detrimental to our business than seeking alternative approaches 

a downturn in any of our tenants’ or operators’ businesses could ultimately lead to bankruptcy if it is unable to timely resolve the underlying causes which may be largely outside of its control bankruptcy and insolvency laws afford certain rights to a party that has filed for bankruptcy or reorganization that may render certain of these remedies unenforceable or at the least delay our ability to pursue such remedies and realize any recoveries in connection therewith for example we cannot evict a tenant or operator solely because of its bankruptcy filing 

a debtor has the right to assume or to assume and assign to a third party or to reject its executory contracts and unexpired leases in a bankruptcy proceeding if a debtor were to reject its leases with us obligations under such rejected leases would cease the claim against the rejecting debtor would be an unsecured claim which would be limited by the statutory cap set forth in the us bankruptcy code this statutory cap may be substantially less than the remaining rent actually owed under the lease in addition a debtor may also assert in bankruptcy proceedings that leases should be recharacterized as financing agreements which could result in our being deemed a lender instead of a landlord a lender’s rights and remedies as compared to a landlord’s generally are materially more unfavorable 

furthermore the automatic stay provisions of the us bankruptcy code would preclude us from enforcing our remedies unless we first obtain relief from the court having jurisdiction over the bankruptcy case this would effectively limit or delay our ability to collect unpaid rent and we may ultimately not receive any payment at all in addition we would likely be required to fund certain expenses and obligations eg real estate taxes insurance debt costs and maintenance expenses to preserve the value of our properties avoid the imposition of liens on our properties or transition our properties to a new tenant operator or manager additionally we lease many of our facilities to healthcare providers who provide longterm custodial care to the elderly evicting these operators for failure to pay rent while the facility is occupied may involve specific procedural or regulatory requirements and may not be successful even if eviction is possible we may determine not to do so due to reputational or other risks 

bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings may also result in increased costs to the operator and significant management distraction if we are unable to transition affected properties they could experience prolonged operational disruption leading to lower occupancy rates and further depressed revenues publicity about the operator’s financial condition and insolvency proceeds may also negatively impact their and our reputations decreasing customer demand and revenues any or all of these risks could have a material adverse effect on our revenues results of operations and cash flows these risks would be magnified where we lease multiple properties to a single operator under a master lease as an operator failure or default under a master lease would expose us to these risks across multiple properties 

 

additionally the financial weakness or other inability of our tenants operators or borrowers to make payments or comply with certain other lease obligations may affect our compliance with certain covenants contained in our debt securities credit facilities and the mortgages on the properties leased or managed by such borrowers tenants and operators or otherwise adversely affect our results of operations under certain conditions defaults under the underlying mortgages may result in cross default under our other indebtedness although we may be able to secure amendments under the applicable agreements in those circumstances the bankruptcy of a borrower tenant or operator may result in less favorable borrowing terms than currently available delays in the availability of funding or other materially adverse consequences 

increased competition and market and legislative changes have resulted and may further result in lower net revenues for some of our tenants operators and borrowers and may affect their ability to meet their financial and other contractual obligations to us 

the healthcare industry is highly competitive the occupancy levels at and rental income from our facilities are dependent on our ability and the ability of our tenants operators and borrowers to compete with other tenants and operators on a number of different levels including the quality of care provided reputation the physical appearance of a facility price the range of services offered family preference alternatives for healthcare delivery the supply of competing properties physicians staff referral sources location and the size and demographics of the population in the surrounding area in addition our tenants operators and borrowers face an increasingly competitive labor market for skilled management personnel and nurses an inability to attract and retain skilled management personnel and nurses and other trained personnel could negatively impact the ability of our tenants operators and borrowers to meet their obligations to us a shortage of nurses or other trained personnel or general inflationary pressures on wages may force tenants operators and borrowers to enhance pay and benefits packages to compete effectively for skilled personnel or to use more expensive contract personnel but they be unable to offset these added costs by increasing the rates charged to residents any increase in labor costs and other property operating expenses or any failure by our tenants operators or borrowers to attract and retain qualified personnel could adversely affect our cash flow and have a materially adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

our tenants operators and borrowers also compete with numerous other companies providing similar healthcare services or alternatives such as home health agencies life care at home communitybased service programs retirement communities and convalescent centers this competition which is due in part to overdevelopment in some segments in which we invest has caused the occupancy rate of newly constructed buildings to slow and the monthly rate that many newly built and previously existing facilities were able to obtain for their services to decrease our tenants operators and borrowers may be unable to achieve occupancy and rate levels and to manage their expenses in a way that will enable them to meet all of their obligations to us further many competing companies may have resources and attributes that are superior to those of our tenants operators and borrowers our tenants operators and borrowers may encounter increased competition that could limit their ability to maintain or attract residents or expand their businesses or to manage their expenses either of which could materially adversely affect their ability to meet their financial and other contractual obligations to us potentially decreasing our revenues and impairing our assets andor increasing collection and dispute costs 

in addition our operators’ revenues are determined by a number of factors including licensed bed capacity occupancy the healthcare needs of residents the rate of reimbursement and or a decrease the income or assets of seniors in the regions in which we operate for example due to generally increased vulnerability to illness occupancy at our senior housing facilities could significantly decrease in the event of a severe flu season an epidemic or any other widespread illness additionally new and evolving payor and provider programs in the united states including but not limited to medicare advantage dual eligible accountable care organizations and bundled payments have resulted in reduced reimbursement rates average length of stay and average daily census particularly for higher acuity patients 

furthermore the new presidential administration and new congress has introduced uncertainty in the direction of the healthcare regulatory landscape and we cannot predict the impact of any regulatory or legislative changes on the industry or our ability to compete effectively therein see the risks described under “—legislation and regulation—the requirements of or changes to governmental reimbursement programs such as medicare or medicaid may adversely affect our tenants’ operators’ and borrowers’ ability to meet their financial and other contractual obligations to us” 

 

competition may make it difficult to identify and purchase or develop suitable healthcare facilities to grow our investment portfolio to finance acquisitions on favorable terms or to retain or attract tenants and operators 

we face significant competition from other reits investment companies private equity and hedge fund investors sovereign funds healthcare operators lenders developers and other institutional investors some of whom may have greater resources and lower costs of capital than we do increased competition makes it more challenging for us to identify and successfully capitalize on opportunities that meet our business goals and could improve the bargaining power of property owners seeking to sell thereby impeding our investment acquisition and development activities similarly our properties face competition for tenants and operators from other properties in the same market which may affect our ability to attract and retain tenants and operators or may reduce the rents we are able to charge if we cannot capitalize on our development pipeline identify and purchase a sufficient quantity of healthcare facilities at favorable prices finance acquisitions on commercially favorable terms or attract and retain profitable tenants and operators our business results of operations and financial condition may be materially adversely affected 

we depend on investments in the healthcare property sector making our profitability more vulnerable to a downturn or slowdown in that specific sector than if we were investing in multiple industries 

we concentrate our investments in the healthcare property sector as a result we are subject to risks inherent to investments in a single industry a downturn or slowdown in the healthcare property sector would have a greater adverse impact on our business than if we had investments in multiple industries specifically a downturn in the healthcare property sector could negatively impact the ability of our tenants operators and borrowers to meet their obligations to us as well as the ability to maintain rental and occupancy rates this could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations in addition a downturn in the healthcare property sector could adversely affect the value of our properties and our ability to sell properties at prices or on terms acceptable to us 

in addition real estate investments are relatively illiquid our ability to quickly sell or exchange any of our properties in response to changes in the performance of our properties or economic and other conditions is limited we may be unable to recognize full value for any property that we seek to sell for liquidity reasons our inability to respond rapidly to changes in the performance of our investments could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations in addition we are exposed to the risks inherent in concentrating investments in real estate and in particular health care industries 

changes within the life science industry may adversely impact our revenues and results of operations 

our life science investments could be adversely affected if the life science industry is impacted by an economic financial or banking crisis or if the life science industry migrates from the us to other countries or to areas outside of primary markets in south san francisco and san diego also some of our properties may be better suited for a particular life science industry client tenant and could require modification before we are able to release vacant space to another life science industry client tenant generally our properties may not be suitable for lease to traditional office client tenants without significant expenditures on renovations 

our ability to negotiate contractual rent escalations on future leases and to achieve increases in rental rates will depend upon market conditions and the demand for life science properties at the time the leases are negotiated and the increases are proposed 

many life science entities have completed mergers or consolidations mergers or consolidations of life science entities in the future could reduce the amount of rentable square footage requirements of our client tenants and prospective client tenants which may adversely impact our revenues from lease payments and results of operations 

the hospitals on whose campuses our mobs are located and their affiliated healthcare systems could fail to remain competitive or financially viable which could adversely impact their ability to attract physicians and physician groups to our mobs and our other facilities that serve the healthcare industry 

our mobs and other facilities that serve the healthcare industry depend on the viability of the hospitals on whose campuses our mobs are located and their affiliated healthcare systems in order to attract physicians and other healthcarerelated users the viability of these hospitals in turn depends on factors such as the quality and mix of healthcare services provided competition demographic trends in the surrounding community market position and growth potential as well 

 

as the ability of the affiliated healthcare systems to provide economies of scale and access to capital if a hospital whose campus is located on or near one of our mobs is unable to meet its financial obligations and if an affiliated healthcare system is unable to support that hospital the hospital may not be able to compete successfully or could be forced to close or relocate which could adversely impact its ability to attract physicians and other healthcarerelated users because we rely on our proximity to and affiliations with these hospitals to create tenant demand for space in our mobs their inability to remain competitive or financially viable or to attract physicians and physician groups could adversely affect our mob operations and have a materially adverse effect on us 

in addition the potential repeal of the affordable care act and related regulations and uncertainty regarding potential replacement legislation could result in significant changes to the scope of insurance coverage and reimbursement policies which could put negative pressure on the operations and revenues of our mobs 

we may be unable to maintain or expand our relationships with our existing and future hospital and health system clients 

the success of our medical office portfolio depends to a large extent on past current and future relationships with hospitals and their affiliated health systems we invest significant amounts of time in developing relationships with both new and existing clients if we fail to maintain these relationships including through a lack of responsiveness failure to adapt to the current market and employment of individuals with adequate experience our reputation and relationships will be harmed and we may lose business to competitors if our relationships with hospitals and their affiliated health systems deteriorate it could have a materially adverse effect on us 

economic and other conditions that negatively affect geographic areas from which a greater percentage of our revenues is recognized could materially adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

for the year ended december 31 2016 26 of our revenue was derived from properties located in california which is also where substantially all of our lifescience portfolio is located as a result we may be subject to increased exposure to adverse conditions affecting the state including downturns in the local economies or changes in local real estate conditions increased competition or decreased demand changes in statespecific legislation and local climate events and natural disasters such as earthquakes wildfires and hurricanes which could cause significant disruption in our businesses in the region harm our ability to compete effectively result in increased costs and divert more management attention any or all of which could adversely affect our business and results of operations 

if we must replace any of our tenants or operators we may have difficulty identifying replacements and we may be required to incur substantial renovation costs to make certain of our healthcare properties suitable for other tenants and operators 

we cannot predict whether our tenants will renew existing leases beyond their current term if we or our tenants terminate or do not renew the leases for our properties we would attempt to reposition those properties with another tenant or operator healthcare facilities are typically highly customized and may not be easily adapted to nonhealthcarerelated uses the improvements generally required to conform a property to healthcare use such as upgrading electrical gas and plumbing infrastructure are costly and at times tenantspecific and may be subject to regulatory requirements a new or replacement tenant or operator may require different features in a property depending on that tenant’s or operator’s particular business in addition infrastructure improvements for life science facilities typically are significantly more costly than improvements to other property types and we may be unable to recover part or all of these higher costs therefore if a current tenant or operator is unable to pay rent andor vacates a property we may incur substantial expenditures to modify a property and experience delays before we are able to secure another tenant or operator or to accommodate multiple tenants or operators these expenditures or renovations and delays may materially adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

additionally we may fail to identify suitable replacements or enter into leases or other arrangements with new tenants or operators on a timely basis or on terms as favorable to us as our current leases if at all we may be required to fund certain expenses and obligations such as real estate taxes debt costs and maintenance expenses to preserve the value of and avoid the imposition of liens on our properties while they are being repositioned in addition we may incur certain obligations and liabilities including obligations to indemnify the replacement tenant or operator which could have a materially adverse 

 

effect on us 

we face additional risks associated with property development and redevelopment that can render a project less profitable or not profitable at all and under certain circumstances prevent completion of development activities once undertaken 

property development is a component of our growth strategy for example in october 2016 we commenced the third phase of the cove at oyster point our newest life science development in south san francisco at december 31 2016 our actual investment and estimated commitments under our development and redevelopment platforms including land held for development represented approximately 673 million or 4 of our total assets largescale groundup development of healthcare properties presents additional risks for us including risks that 









any of the foregoing risks could materially adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

our use of joint ventures may limit our flexibility with jointly owned investments 

we have and may continue in the future to develop andor acquire properties in joint ventures with other persons or entities when circumstances warrant the use of these structures our participation in joint ventures is subject to risks that may not be present with other methods of ownership including 













any of the foregoing risks could materially adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

from time to time we acquire other companies and if we are unable to successfully integrate these operations our business results of operations and financial condition may be materially adversely affected 

acquisitions require the integration of companies that have previously operated independently successful integration of 

 

the operations of these companies depends primarily on our ability to consolidate operations systems procedures properties and personnel and to eliminate redundancies and costs we may encounter difficulties in these integrations potential difficulties associated with acquisitions include our ability to effectively monitor and manage our expanded portfolio of properties the loss of key employees the disruption of our ongoing business or that of the acquired entity possible inconsistencies in standards controls procedures and policies and the assumption of unexpected liabilities including 













in addition the acquired companies and their properties may fail to perform as expected including in respect of estimated cost savings inaccurate assumptions regarding future rental or occupancy rates could result in overly optimistic estimates of future revenues similarly we may underestimate future operating expenses or the costs necessary to bring properties up to standards established for their intended use or for property improvements 

if we have difficulties with any of these areas or if we later discover additional liabilities or experience unforeseen costs relating to our acquired companies we might not achieve the economic benefits we expect from our acquisitions and this may materially adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

from time to time we have made and we may seek to make one or more material acquisitions which may involve the expenditure of significant funds 

we regularly review potential transactions in order to maximize stockholder value our review process may require significant management attention and a potential transaction could be abandoned or rejected by us or the other parties involved after we expend significant resources and time in addition future acquisitions may require the issuance of securities the incurrence of debt assumption of contingent liabilities or incurrence of significant expenditures each of which could materially adversely impact our business financial condition or results of operations in addition the financing required for such acquisitions may not be available on commercially favorable terms or at all 

our tenants operators and borrowers face litigation and may experience rising liability and insurance costs 

in some states advocacy groups have been created to monitor the quality of care at healthcare facilities and these groups have brought litigation against the tenants and operators of such facilities also in several instances private litigation by patients residents or “whistleblowers” has sought and sometimes resulted in large damage awards see “—the requirements of or changes to governmental reimbursement programs such as medicare or medicaid may adversely affect our tenants’ operators’ and borrowers’ ability to meet their financial and other contractual obligations to us” the effect of this litigation and other potential litigation may materially increase the costs incurred by our tenants operators and borrowers for monitoring and reporting quality of care compliance in addition their cost of liability and medical malpractice insurance can be significant and may increase or not be available at a reasonable cost so long as the present healthcare litigation environment continues cost increases could cause our tenants and operators to be unable to make their lease or mortgage payments or fail to purchase the appropriate liability and malpractice insurance or cause our borrowers to be unable to meet their obligations to us potentially decreasing our revenues and increasing our collection and litigation costs in addition as a result of our ownership of healthcare facilities we may be named as a defendant in lawsuits arising from the alleged actions of our tenants or operators for which claims such tenants and operators have agreed to indemnify us but which may require unanticipated expenditures on our part furthermore although our leases and agreements provide us with certain information rights with respect to our tenants and operators one or more of our tenants may be or become party to pending litigation or investigation to which we are unaware or do not have a right to participate or evaluate in such cases we would be unable to determine the potential impact of such litigation or 

 

investigation on our tenants or our business or results moreover negative publicity of any of our operators’ or tenants’ litigation other legal proceedings or investigations may also negatively impact their and our reputation resulting in lower customer demand and revenues which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flow 

we through our subsidiaries enter into management contracts with third party eligible independent contractors to manage some of our facilities whereby we assume additional operational risks and are subject to additional regulation and liability 

ridea structures at the year ended december 31 2016 accounted for 24 of our gross segment assets ridea permits reits such as us to lease healthcare facilities that we own or partially own to a trs provided that our trs hires an independent qualifying management company to operate the facility under the ridea lease structure the independent qualifying management company receives a management fee from our trs for operating the facility as an independent contractor as the owner of the facility contracting out operational responsibility we assume more of the operational risk relative to other structures because we lease our facility to our own partially or whollyowned subsidiary rather than a third party operator our resulting revenues therefore depend more on occupancy rates the rates charged to residents and the ability to control operating expenses our trs and hence we are responsible for any operating deficits incurred by the facility 

the operator which would be our trs when we use a ridea lease structure of a healthcare facility is generally required to be the holder of the applicable healthcare license this licensing requirement subjects our trs and us through our ownership interest in our trs to various regulatory laws including those described above most states regulate and inspect healthcare facility operations patient care construction and the safety of the physical environment if one or more of our healthcare real estate facilities fails to comply with applicable laws our trs if it holds the healthcare license and is the entity enrolled in government health care programs could be subject to penalties including loss or suspension of license certification or accreditation exclusion from government healthcare programs ie medicare medicaid administrative sanctions civil monetary penalties and in certain instances criminal penalties additionally if our trs holds the healthcare license it could have exposure to professional liability claims arising out of an alleged breach of the applicable standard of care rules 

in addition rents from this trs structure are treated as qualifying rents from real property if i they are paid pursuant to an armslength lease of a “qualified healthcare property” with the trs and ii the manager qualifies as an “eligible independent contractor” as defined in the code if either of these conditions is not satisfied then the rents will not be qualifying rents 

the requirements of or changes to governmental reimbursement programs such as medicare or medicaid may adversely affect our tenants’ operators’ and borrowers’ ability to meet their financial and other contractual obligations to us 

certain of our tenants operators and borrowers are affected directly or indirectly by an extremely complex set of federal state and local laws and regulations pertaining to governmental reimbursement programs these laws and regulations are subject to frequent and substantial changes that are sometimes applied retroactively see “item 1—business—government regulation licensing and enforcement” above for example to the extent that our tenants operators or borrowers receive a significant portion of their revenues from governmental payors primarily medicare and medicaid they are generally subject to among other things 













 







the failure to comply with the extensive laws regulations and other requirements applicable to their business and the operation of our properties could result in among other challenges i becoming ineligible to receive reimbursement from governmental reimbursement programs ii bans on admissions of new patients or residents iii civil or criminal penalties and iv significant operational changes these laws and regulations are enforced by a variety of federal state and local agencies and can also be enforced by private litigants through among other things federal and state false claims acts which allow private litigants to bring qui tam or “whistleblower” actions for example we have provided a loan to tandem health care “tandem” a property company with ownership interests in 69 facilities totaling 6924 beds see note 7 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information the sole operator of tandem’s facilities consulate health care “consulate” is facing a qui tam or “whistleblower” action alleging that consulate overbilled the federal government and the state of florida  united states of america v cmc ii llc et al  us district court md florida trial commenced on january 17 2017 and we are unable to assess a likely outcome however a negative outcome could have a materially adverse effect on consulate which in turn could have a resulting materially adverse effect on tandem’s ability to meet its debt service obligations to us regardless of the ultimate outcome our tenants operators and borrowers could be adversely affected by the resources required to respond to an investigation or other enforcement action in such event the results of operations and financial condition of our tenants and the results of operations of our properties operated by those entities could be materially adversely affected which in turn could have a materially adverse effect on us we are unable to predict future federal state and local regulations and legislation including the medicare and medicaid statutes and regulations or the intensity of enforcement efforts with respect to such regulations and legislation and any changes in the regulatory framework could have a materially adverse effect on our tenants and operators which in turn could have a materially adverse effect on us 

sometimes governmental payors freeze or reduce payments to healthcare providers or provide annual reimbursement rate increases that are smaller than expected due to budgetary and other pressures healthcare reimbursement will likely continue to be of significant importance to federal and state authorities we cannot make any assessment as to the ultimate timing or the effect that any future legislative reforms may have on our tenants’ operators’ and borrowers’ costs of doing business and on the amount of reimbursement by government and other thirdparty payors the failure of any of our tenants operators or borrowers to comply with these laws and regulations and significant limits on the scope of services reimbursed and on reimbursement rates and fees could materially adversely affect their ability to meet their financial and contractual obligations to us 

furthermore executive orders and legislation may repeal the affordable care act and related regulations in whole or in part we also anticipate that congress state legislatures and thirdparty payors may continue to review and assess alternative healthcare delivery and payment systems and may propose and adopt legislation or policy changes or implementations effecting additional fundamental changes in the healthcare system we cannot quantify or predict the likely impact of these possible changes on our business model prospects financial condition or results of operations 

legislation to address federal government operations and administration decisions affecting the centers for medicare and medicaid services could have a materially adverse effect on our tenants’ operators’ and borrowers’ liquidity financial condition or results of operations 

congressional consideration of legislation pertaining to the federal debt ceiling the affordable care act tax reform and entitlement programs including reimbursement rates for physicians could have a materially adverse effect on our tenants’ operators’ and borrowers’ liquidity financial condition or results of operations in particular reduced funding for entitlement programs such as medicare and medicaid may result in increased costs and fees for programs such as medicare advantage plans and additional reductions in reimbursements to providers amendments to or repeal of the affordable care act and decisions by the centers for medicare and medicaid services could impact the delivery of services and benefits under medicare medicaid or medicare advantage plans and could affect our tenants and operators and the manner in which they are reimbursed by such programs such changes could have a materially adverse effect on our tenants’ operators’ and borrowers’ liquidity financial condition or results of operations which could adversely affect their ability to satisfy their obligations to us and could have a materially adverse effect on us 

 

tenants and operators that fail to comply with federal state local and international laws and regulations including licensure certification and inspection requirements may cease to operate or be unable to meet their financial and other contractual obligations to us 

our tenants operators and borrowers are subject to or impacted by extensive frequently changing federal state local and international laws and regulations these laws and regulations include among others laws protecting consumers against deceptive practices laws relating to the operation of our properties and how our tenants and operators conduct their business such as fire health and safety and privacy laws federal and state laws affecting hospitals clinics and other healthcare communities that participate in both medicare and medicaid that mandate allowable costs pricing reimbursement procedures and limitations quality of services and care food service and physical plants and similar foreign laws regulating the healthcare industry resident rights laws including abuse and neglect laws and fraud laws antikickback and physician referral laws the ada and similar state and local laws and safety and health standards set by the occupational safety and health administration or similar foreign agencies certain of our properties may also require a license registration andor certificate of need to operate 

our tenants’ operators’ or borrowers’ failure to comply with any of these laws regulations or requirements could result in loss of accreditation denial of reimbursement imposition of fines suspension or decertification from government healthcare programs loss of license or closure of the facility andor the incurrence of considerable costs arising from an investigation or regulatory action which may have an adverse effect on facilities owned by or mortgaged to us and therefore may materially adversely impact us see “item 1—business—government regulation licensing and enforcement—healthcare licensure and certificate of need” above 

our tenants in the life science industry face high levels of regulation expense and uncertainty 

life science tenants particularly those involved in developing and marketing pharmaceutical products are subject to certain unique risks including the following 













if our tenants’ businesses are adversely affected they may have difficulty making payments to us which could materially adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

 

we may be unable to successfully foreclose on the collateral securing our real estaterelated loans and even if we are successful in our foreclosure efforts we may be unable to successfully operate occupy or reposition the underlying real estate which may adversely affect our ability to recover our investments 

if a tenant or operator defaults under one of our mortgages or mezzanine loans we may have to foreclose on the loan or protect our interest by acquiring title to the collateral and thereafter making substantial improvements or repairs in order to maximize the property’s investment potential in some cases the collateral consists of the equity interests in an entity that directly or indirectly owns the applicable real property or interests in operating facilities and accordingly we may not have full recourse to assets of that entity or that entity may have incurred unexpected liabilities tenants operators or borrowers may contest enforcement of foreclosure or other remedies seek bankruptcy protection against our exercise of enforcement or other remedies andor bring claims for lender liability in response to actions to enforce mortgage obligations foreclosurerelated costs high loantovalue ratios or declines in the value of the facility may prevent us from realizing an amount equal to our mortgage or mezzanine loan upon foreclosure and we may be required to record a valuation allowance for such losses even if we are able to successfully foreclose on the collateral securing our real estaterelated loans we may inherit properties for which we may be unable to expeditiously secure tenants or operators if at all or we may acquire equity interests that we are unable to immediately resell due to limitations under the securities laws either of which would adversely affect our ability to fully recover our investment 

required regulatory approvals can delay or prohibit transfers of our healthcare facilities 

transfers of healthcare facilities to successor tenants or operators may be subject to regulatory approvals or ratifications including but not limited to change of ownership approvals and medicare and medicaid provider arrangements that are not required for transfers of other types of commercial operations and other types of real estate the replacement of any tenant or operator could be delayed by the regulatory approval process of any federal state or local government agency necessary for the transfer of the facility or the replacement of the operator licensed to manage the facility if we are unable to find a suitable replacement tenant or operator upon favorable terms or at all we may take possession of a facility which might expose us to successor liability require us to indemnify subsequent operators to whom we might transfer the operating rights and licenses or require us to spend substantial time and funds to preserve the value of the property and adapt the facility to other uses all of which may materially adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

  

risks related to our capital structure and market conditions 

we rely on external sources of capital to fund future capital needs and if access to such capital is unavailable on acceptable terms or at all it could have a materially adverse effect on our ability to meet commitments as they become due or make future investments necessary to grow our business 

we may not be able to fund all future capital needs including capital expenditures debt maturities and other commitments from cash retained from operations if we are unable to obtain enough internal capital we may need to rely on external sources of capital including debt and equity financing to fulfill our capital requirements our access to capital depends upon a number of factors some of which we have little or no control over including but not limited to 















 







if access to capital is unavailable on acceptable terms or at all it could have a materially adverse impact on our ability to fund operations repay or refinance our debt obligations fund dividend payments acquire properties and make the investments needed to grow our business 

adverse changes in our credit ratings could impair our ability to obtain additional debt and equity financing on favorable terms if at all and negatively impact the market price of our securities including our common stock 

our credit ratings can affect the amount and type of capital we can access as well as the terms of any financing we may obtain we may be unable to maintain our current credit ratings and in the event that our current credit ratings deteriorate we would likely incur higher borrowing costs and it may be more difficult or expensive to obtain additional financing or refinance existing obligations and commitments also a downgrade in our credit ratings would trigger additional costs or other potentially negative consequences under our current and future credit facilities and debt instruments the credit ratings of our senior unsecured debt are based on among other things our operating performance liquidity and leverage ratios overall financial position level of indebtedness and pending or future changes in the regulatory framework applicable to our operators and our industry 

our level of indebtedness may increase and materially adversely affect our future operations 

our outstanding indebtedness as of december 31 2016 was approximately 92 billion we may incur additional indebtedness in the future including in connection with the development or acquisition of assets which may be substantial any significant additional indebtedness could negatively affect the credit ratings of our debt and require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow to interest and principal payments due on our indebtedness greater demands on our cash resources may reduce funds available to us to pay dividends conduct development activities make capital expenditures and acquisitions or carry out other aspects of our business strategy increased indebtedness can also make us more vulnerable to general adverse economic and industry conditions and create competitive disadvantages for us compared to other companies with relatively lower debt levels increased future debt service obligations may limit our operational flexibility including our ability to finance or refinance our properties contribute properties to joint ventures or sell properties as needed 

covenants in our debt instruments limit our operational flexibility and breaches of these covenants could materially adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

the terms of our current secured and unsecured debt instruments and other indebtedness that we may incur in the future require or will require us to comply with a number of customary financial and other covenants such as maintaining leverage ratios minimum tangible net worth requirements reit status and certain levels of debt service coverage our continued ability to incur additional debt and to conduct business in general is subject to compliance with these financial and other covenants which limit our operational flexibility for example mortgages on our properties contain customary covenants such as those that limit or restrict our ability without the consent of the lender to further encumber or sell the applicable properties or to replace the applicable tenant or operator breaches of certain covenants may result in defaults under the mortgages on our properties and crossdefaults under certain of our other indebtedness even if we satisfy our payment obligations to the respective obligee covenants that limit our operational flexibility as well as defaults resulting from the breach of any of these covenants could materially adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

 

an increase in interest rates could increase interest cost on new debt and existing variable rate debt and could materially adversely impact our ability to refinance existing debt sell assets and conduct acquisition investment and development activities 

since the most recent recession the us federal reserve has taken actions which have resulted in low interest rates prevailing in the marketplace for a historically long period of time in december 2016 the us federal reserve raised its benchmark interest rate by a quarter of a percentage point at this point it is uncertain what impact the december rate increase might have on us additionally market interest rates may continue to increase and the increase may materially and negatively affect us if interest rates increase so could our interest costs for any variable rate debt and for new debt this increased cost could make the financing of any acquisition and development activity more costly rising interest rates could limit our ability to refinance existing debt when it matures or cause us to pay higher interest rates upon refinancing and increase interest expense on refinanced indebtedness in addition an increase in interest rates could decrease the amount third parties are willing to pay for our assets thereby limiting our ability to reposition our portfolio promptly in response to changes in economic or other conditions 

we manage a portion of our exposure to interest rate risk by accessing debt with staggered maturities and through the use of derivative instruments primarily interest rate swap agreements however no amount of hedging activity can fully insulate us from the risks associated with changes in interest rates swap agreements involve risk including that counterparties may fail to honor their obligations under these arrangements that these arrangements may not be effective in reducing our exposure to interest rate changes that the amount of income we earn from hedging transactions may be limited by federal tax provisions governing reits and that these arrangements may cause us to pay higher interest rates on our debt obligations than would otherwise be the case failure to hedge effectively against interest rate risk if we choose to engage in such activities could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

volatility disruption or uncertainty in the financial markets may impair our ability to raise capital obtain new financing or refinance existing obligations and fund real estate and development activities 

the global financial markets have experienced and may continue to undergo periods of significant volatility disruption and uncertainty while economic conditions have improved since the economic downturn in 2008 and 2009 economic growth has at times been slow and uneven and the strength and sustainability of an economic recovery is challenging and uncertain increased or prolonged market disruption volatility or uncertainty could materially adversely impact our ability to raise capital obtain new financing or refinance our existing obligations as they mature and fund real estate and development activities 

market volatility could also lead to significant uncertainty in the valuation of our investments and those of our joint ventures which may result in a substantial decrease in the value of our properties and those of our joint ventures as a result we may be unable to recover the carrying amount of such investments and the associated goodwill if any which may require us to recognize impairment charges in earnings 

we may be adversely affected by fluctuations in currency exchange rates 

we may pursue growth opportunities in international markets where the us dollar is not the denominated currency the ownership of investments located outside of the united states subjects us to risk from fluctuations in exchange rates between foreign currencies and the us dollar a significant change in the value of the british pound sterling “gbp” may have a materially adverse effect on our financial position debt covenant ratios results of operations and cash flow 

we may attempt to manage the impact of foreign currency exchange rate changes through the use of derivative contracts or other methods for example we currently utilize gbp denominated liabilities as a natural hedge against our gbp denominated assets additionally we executed currency swap contracts to hedge the risk related to a portion of the forecasted interest receipts on these investments however no amount of hedging activity can fully insulate us from the risks associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates and the failure to hedge effectively against foreign currency exchange rate risk if we choose to engage in such activities could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition in addition any international currency gain recognized with respect to changes in exchange rates may not qualify under the 75 gross income test or the 95 gross income test that we must satisfy annually in order to qualify and maintain our status as a reit 

 

  

  

risks related to other events 

we are subject to certain provisions of maryland law and our charter relating to business combinations which may prevent a transaction that may otherwise be in the interest of our stockholders 

the maryland business combination act provides that unless exempted a maryland corporation may not engage in business combinations including a merger consolidation share exchange or in circumstances specified in the statute an asset transfer or issuance or reclassification of equity securities with an “interested stockholder” or an affiliate of an interested stockholder for five years after the most recent date on which the interested stockholder became an interested stockholder and thereafter unless specified criteria are met an interested stockholder is generally a person owning or controlling directly or indirectly 10 or more of the voting power of the outstanding voting stock of a maryland corporation unless our board of directors takes action to exempt us generally or with respect to certain transactions from this statute in the future the maryland business combination act will be applicable to business combinations between us and other persons 

in addition to the restrictions on business combinations contained in the maryland business combination act our charter also contains restrictions on business combinations our charter requires that except in certain circumstances “business combinations” including a merger or consolidation and certain asset transfers and issuances of securities with a “related person” including a beneficial owner of 10 or more of our outstanding voting stock be approved by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 90 of our outstanding voting stock 

the restrictions on business combinations provided under maryland law and contained in our charter may delay defer or prevent a change of control or other transaction even if such transaction involves a premium price for our common stock or our stockholders believe that such transaction is otherwise in their best interests 

unfavorable resolution of litigation matters and disputes could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition 

from time to time we are involved in legal proceedings lawsuits and other claims we may also be named as defendants in lawsuits arising out of our alleged actions or the alleged actions of our tenants and operators for which such tenants and operators have agreed to indemnify defend and hold us harmless an unfavorable resolution of any such litigation may have a materially adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition regardless of the outcome litigation or other legal proceedings may result in substantial costs disruption of our normal business operations and the diversion of management attention we may be unable to prevail in or achieve a favorable settlement of any pending or future legal action against us see item 3—legal proceedings of this annual report on form 10k 

loss of our key personnel could temporarily disrupt our operations and adversely affect us 

we depend on the efforts of our executive officers and competition for these individuals is intense although they are covered by our executive severance plan and change in control plan which provide many of the benefits typically found in executive employment agreements none of our executive chairman chief executive officer or incoming chief financial officer have employment agreements with us we cannot assure you that they or our president who does have an employment agreement with us will remain employed with us the loss or limited availability of the services of any of our executive officers or our inability to recruit and retain qualified personnel in the future could at least temporarily have a materially adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition and the value of our common stock 

we may experience uninsured or underinsured losses which could result in a significant loss of the capital invested in a property lower than expected future revenues or unanticipated expense 

we maintain comprehensive insurance coverage on our properties with terms conditions limits and deductibles that we believe are adequate and appropriate given the relative risk and costs of such coverage and we regularly review our insurance coverage however a large number of our properties are located in areas exposed to earthquake windstorm flood and other natural disasters and may be subject to other losses in particular our life science portfolio is concentrated 

 

in areas known to be subject to earthquake activity while we purchase insurance coverage for earthquake windstorm flood and other natural disasters that we believe is adequate in light of current industry practice and analyses prepared by outside consultants such insurance may not fully cover such losses these losses can result in decreased anticipated revenues from a property and the loss of all or a portion of the capital we have invested in a property following these events we may remain liable for any mortgage debt or other financial obligations related to the property the insurance market for such exposures can be very volatile and we may be unable to purchase the limits and terms we desire on a commercially reasonable basis in the future in addition there are certain exposures for which we do not purchase insurance because we do not believe it is economically feasible to do so or where there is no viable insurance market 

if one of our properties experiences a loss that is uninsured or that exceeds policy coverage limits we could lose our investment in the damaged property as well as the anticipated future cash flows from such property if the damaged property is subject to recourse indebtedness we could continue to be liable for the indebtedness even if the property is irreparably damaged 

in addition even if damage to our properties is covered by insurance a disruption of business caused by a casualty event may result in loss of revenues for us any business interruption insurance may not fully compensate them or us for such loss of revenue 

environmental compliance costs and liabilities associated with our real estaterelated investments may be substantial and may materially impair the value of those investments 

federal state and local laws ordinances and regulations may require us as a current or previous owner of real estate to investigate and clean up certain hazardous or toxic substances or petroleum released at a property we may be held liable to a governmental entity or to third parties for property damage and for investigation and cleanup costs incurred by the third parties in connection with the contamination the costs of cleanup and remediation could be substantial in addition some environmental laws create a lien on the contaminated site in favor of the government for damages and the costs it incurs in connection with the contamination 

although we currently carry environmental insurance on our properties in an amount that we believe is commercially reasonable and generally require our tenants and operators to indemnify us for environmental liabilities they cause such liabilities could exceed the amount of our insurance the financial ability of the tenant or operator to indemnify us or the value of the contaminated property as the owner of a site we may also be held liable to third parties for damages and injuries resulting from environmental contamination emanating from the site we may also experience environmental liabilities arising from conditions not known to us the cost of defending against these claims complying with environmental regulatory requirements conducting remediation of any contaminated property or paying personal injury or other claims or fines could be substantial and could have a materially adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

in addition the presence of contamination or the failure to remediate contamination may materially adversely affect our ability to use sell or lease the property or to borrow using the property as collateral 

we rely on information technology in our operations and any material failure inadequacy interruption or security failure of that technology could harm our business 

we rely on information technology networks and systems including the internet to process transmit and store electronic information and to manage or support a variety of business processes including financial transactions and records and maintaining personal identifying information and tenant and lease data we purchase some of our information technology from vendors on whom our systems depend we rely on commercially available systems software tools and monitoring to provide security for the processing transmission and storage of confidential tenant and customer data including individually identifiable information relating to financial accounts although we have taken steps to protect the security of our information systems and the data maintained in those systems it is possible that our safety and security measures will not prevent the systems’ improper functioning or damage or the improper access or disclosure of personally identifiable information such as in the event of cyberattacks security breaches including physical or electronic breakins computer viruses attacks by hackers and similar breaches can create system disruptions shutdowns or unauthorized disclosure of confidential information the risk of security breaches has generally increased as the number intensity and sophistication 

 

of attacks have increased in some cases it may be difficult to anticipate or immediately detect such incidents and the damage they cause any failure to maintain proper function security and availability of our information systems could interrupt our operations damage our reputation subject us to liability claims or regulatory penalties and could have a materially adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

  

risk related to tax including reitrelated risks 

loss of our tax status as a reit would substantially reduce our available funds and would have materially adverse consequences for us and the value of our common stock 

qualification as a reit involves the application of numerous highly technical and complex provisions of the internal revenue code of 1986 as amended the “code” for which there are only limited judicial and administrative interpretations as well as the determination of various factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control we intend to continue to operate in a manner that enables us to qualify as a reit however our qualification and taxation as a reit depend upon our ability to meet through actual annual operating results asset diversification distribution levels and diversity of stock ownership the various qualification tests imposed under the code for example to qualify as a reit at least 95 of our gross income in any year must be derived from qualifying sources and we must make distributions to our stockholders aggregating annually at least 90 of our reit taxable income excluding net capital gains in addition new legislation regulations administrative interpretations or court decisions could change the tax laws or interpretations of the tax laws regarding qualification as a reit or the federal income tax consequences of that qualification in a manner that is materially adverse to our stockholders accordingly there is no assurance that we have operated or will continue to operate in a manner so as to qualify or remain qualified as a reit 

if we lose our reit status we will face serious tax consequences that will substantially reduce the funds available to make payments of principal and interest on the debt securities we issue and to make distributions to stockholders if we fail to qualify as a reit 









as a result of all these factors our failure to qualify as a reit could also impair our ability to expand our business and raise capital and could materially adversely affect the value of our common stock 

the present federal income tax treatment of reits may be modified possibly with retroactive effect by legislative judicial or administrative action at any time which could affect the federal income tax treatment of an investment in us the federal income tax rules dealing with reits constantly are under review by persons involved in the legislative process the us internal revenue service the “irs” and the us treasury department which results in statutory changes as well as frequent revisions to regulations and interpretations revisions in federal tax laws and interpretations thereof could affect or cause us to change our investments and commitments and affect the tax considerations of an investment in us 

we could have potential deferred and contingent tax liabilities from corporate acquisitions that could limit delay or impede future sales of our properties 

if during the fiveyear period beginning on the date we acquire certain companies we recognize a gain on the disposition of any property acquired then to the extent of the excess of i the fair market value of such property as of the acquisition date over ii our adjusted income tax basis in such property as of that date we will be required to pay a corporatelevel federal income tax on this gain at the highest regular corporate rate there can be no assurance that these triggering dispositions will not occur and these requirements could limit delay or impede future sales of our properties 

 

in addition the irs may assert liabilities against us for corporate income taxes for taxable years prior to the time that we acquire certain companies in which case we will owe these taxes plus interest and penalties if any 

there are uncertainties relating to the calculation of nonreit tax earnings and profits “ep” in certain acquisitions which may require us to distribute ep 

in order to remain qualified as a reit we are required to distribute to our stockholders all of the accumulated nonreit ep of certain companies that we acquire prior to the close of the first taxable year in which the acquisition occurs failure to make such ep distributions would result in our disqualification as a reit the determination of the amount to be distributed in such ep distributions is a complex factual and legal determination we may have less than complete information at the time we undertake our analysis or we may interpret the applicable law differently from the irs we currently believe that we have satisfied the requirements relating to such ep distributions there are however substantial uncertainties relating to the determination of ep including the possibility that the irs could successfully assert that the taxable income of the companies acquired should be increased which would increase our nonreit ep moreover an audit of the acquired company following our acquisition could result in an increase in accumulated nonreit ep which could require us to pay an additional taxable distribution to our thenexisting stockholders if we qualify under rules for curing this type of default or could result in our disqualification as a reit 

thus we might fail to satisfy the requirement that we distribute all of our nonreit ep by the close of the first taxable year in which the acquisition occurs moreover although there are procedures available to cure a failure to distribute all of our ep we cannot now determine whether we will be able to take advantage of these procedures or the economic impact on us of doing so 

recent tax legislation impacts certain us federal income tax rules applicable to reits and could adversely affect our current tax positions 

the protecting americans from tax hikes act of 2015 the “act” contains changes to certain aspects of the us federal income tax rules applicable to us the act is the most recent example of changes to the reit rules and additional legislative changes may occur that could adversely affect our current tax positions the act modifies various rules that apply to our ownership of and business relationship with our trss and reduces the maximum allowable value of our assets attributable to trss from 25 to 20 which could impact our ability to enter into future investments the act makes permanent the reduction of the recognition period from ten years to five years during which an entity that converted from a corporation to a reit or was acquired by a reit is subject to a corporatelevel tax on builtin gains recognized during such period which could influence the types of investments we enter into in the future the act also makes multiple changes related to the foreign investment in real property tax act or firpta expands prohibited transaction safe harbors and qualifying hedges and repeals the preferential dividend rule for public reits previously applicable to us lastly the act adjusts the way we may calculate certain earnings and profits calculations to avoid double taxation at the stockholder level and expands the types of qualifying assets and income for purposes of the reit requirements the provisions enacted by the act could result in changes in our tax positions or investments and future legislative changes related to those rules described above could have a materially adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition 

our international investments and operations may result in additional taxrelated risks 

we have investments and operations in the united kingdom and may further expand internationally international expansion presents taxrelated risks that are different from those we face with respect to our domestic properties and operations these risks include but are not limited to 







 

our charter contains ownership limits with respect to our common stock and other classes of capital stock 

our charter contains restrictions on the ownership and transfer of our common stock and preferred stock that are intended to assist us in preserving our qualification as a reit under our charter subject to certain exceptions no person or entity may own actually or constructively more than 98 by value or by number of shares whichever is more restrictive of the outstanding shares of our common stock or any class or series of our preferred stock 

additionally our charter has a 99 ownership limitation on the direct or indirect ownership of our voting shares which may include common stock or other classes of capital stock our board of directors in its sole discretion may exempt a proposed transferee from either ownership limit the ownership limits may delay defer or prevent a transaction or a change of control that might involve a premium price for our common stock or might otherwise be in the best interests of our stockholders

results of operations 

we evaluate our business and allocate resources among our reportable business segments i senior housing triplenet sh nnn ii senior housing operating portfolio shop iii life science and iv medical office under the medical office segment we invest through the acquisition and development of mobs which generally require a greater level of property management otherwise we primarily invest through the acquisition and development of real estate in single tenant and operator properties we have other nonreportable segments that are comprised primarily of our uk care homes debt investments and hospitals we evaluate performance based upon i property net operating income from continuing operations “noi” and ii adjusted noi cash noi of the combined consolidated and unconsolidated investments in each segment the accounting policies of the segments are the same as those described in the summary of significant accounting policies see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements 

 

nongaap financial measures 

net operating income 

noi and adjusted noi are nonus generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” supplemental financial measures used to evaluate the operating performance of real estate we include properties from our consolidated portfolio as well as our prorata share of properties owned by our unconsolidated joint ventures in our noi and adjusted noi we believe providing this information assists investors and analysts in estimating the economic interest in our total portfolio of real estate our prorata share information is prepared on a basis consistent with the comparable consolidated amounts is intended to reflect our proportionate economic interest in the operating results of properties in our portfolio and is calculated by applying our actual ownership percentage for the period we do not control the unconsolidated joint ventures and the prorata presentations of revenues and expenses included in noi see below do not represent our legal claim to such items the joint venture members or partners are entitled to profit or loss allocations and distributions of cash flows according to the joint venture agreements which provide for such allocations generally according to their invested capital 

the presentation of prorata information has limitations which include but are not limited to the following i the amounts shown on the individual line items were derived by applying our overall economic ownership interest percentage determined when applying the equity method of accounting and do not necessarily represent our legal claim to the assets and liabilities or the revenues and expenses and ii other companies in our industry may calculate their prorata interest differently limiting the usefulness as a comparative measure because of these limitations the prorata financial information should not be considered independently or as a substitute for our financial statements as reported under gaap we compensate for these limitations by relying primarily on our gaap financial statements using the prorata financial information as a supplement 

noi is defined as rental and related revenues including tenant recoveries resident fees and services and income from dfls less property level operating expenses noi excludes all other financial statement amounts included in net income loss as presented in note 14 to the consolidated financial statements management believes noi provides relevant and useful information because it reflects only income and operating expense items that are incurred at the property level and presents them on an unleveraged basis adjusted noi is calculated as noi after eliminating the effects of straightline rents dfl noncash interest amortization of market lease intangibles nonrefundable entrance fees and lease termination fees “noncash adjustments” adjusted noi is oftentimes referred to as “cash noi” we use noi and adjusted noi to make decisions about resource allocations to assess and compare property level performance and to evaluate our same property portfolio “spp” as described below we believe that net income loss is the most directly comparable gaap measure to noi noi should not be viewed as an alternative measure of operating performance to net income loss as defined by gaap since it does not reflect various excluded items further our definition of noi may not be comparable to the definition used by other reits or real estate companies as they may use different methodologies for calculating noi for a reconciliation of noi and adjusted noi to net income loss by segment refer to note 14 to the consolidated financial statements 

operating expenses generally relate to leased medical office and life science properties and senior housing ridea properties we generally recover all or a portion of our leased medical office and life science property expenses through tenant recoveries we present expenses as operating or general and administrative based on the underlying nature of the expense periodically we review the classification of expenses between categories and make revisions based on changes in the underlying nature of the expenses 

same property portfolio 

spp noi and adjusted noi information allows us to evaluate the performance of our property portfolio under a consistent population by eliminating changes in the composition of our portfolio of properties we include properties from our consolidated portfolio as well as properties owned by our unconsolidated joint ventures in our spp noi and adjusted noi see noi above for further discussion regarding our use of prorata share information and its limitations we identify our spp as stabilized properties that remained in operations and were consistently reported as leased properties or ridea properties for the duration of the yearoveryear comparison periods presented excluding assets held for sale accordingly it takes a stabilized property a minimum of 12 months in operations under a consistent reporting structure to be included in our spp newly acquired operating assets are generally considered stabilized at the earlier of leaseup typically when the tenants controls the physical use of at least 80 of the space or 12 months from the acquisition date newly 

 

completed developments and redevelopments are considered stabilized at the earlier of leaseup or 24 months from the date the property is placed in service spp noi excludes i certain nonproperty specific operating expenses that are allocated to each operating segment on a consolidated basis and ii entrance fees and related activity such as deferred expenses reserves and management fees related to entrance fees a property is removed from our spp when it is sold placed into redevelopment or changes its reporting structure for a reconciliation of spp to total portfolio adjusted noi and other relevant disclosures by segment refer to our segment analysis below 

funds from operations 

we believe ffo applicable to common shares diluted ffo applicable to common shares and diluted ffo per common share are important supplemental nongaap measures of operating performance for a reit because the historical cost accounting convention used for real estate assets utilizes straightline depreciation except on land such accounting presentation implies that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time since real estate values instead have historically risen and fallen with market conditions presentations of operating results for a reit that use historical cost accounting for depreciation could be less informative the term ffo was designed by the reit industry to address this issue 

ffo as defined by the national association of real estate investment trusts “nareit” is net income loss applicable to common shares computed in accordance with gaap excluding gains or losses from sales of depreciable property including any current and deferred taxes directly associated with sales of depreciable property impairments of or related to depreciable real estate plus real estate and other depreciation and amortization and adjustments to compute our share of ffo and ffo as adjusted see below from joint ventures adjustments for joint ventures are calculated to reflect our prorata share of both our consolidated and unconsolidated joint ventures we reflect our share of ffo for unconsolidated joint ventures by applying our actual ownership percentage for the period to the applicable reconciling items on an entity by entity basis we reflect our share for consolidated joint ventures in which we do not own 100 of the equity by adjusting our ffo to remove the third party ownership share of the applicable reconciling items based on actual ownership percentage for the applicable periods our prorata share information is prepared on a basis consistent with the comparable consolidated amounts is intended to reflect our proportionate economic interest in the operating results of properties in our portfolio and is calculated by applying our actual ownership percentage for the period we do not control the unconsolidated joint ventures and the prorata presentations of reconciling items included in ffo see above do not represent our legal claim to such items the joint venture members or partners are entitled to profit or loss allocations and distributions of cash flows according to the joint venture agreements which provide for such allocations generally according to their invested capital

debt 

bank line of credit and term loans our 20 billion unsecured revolving line of credit facility the “facility” matures on march 31 2018 and contains a oneyear extension option borrowings under the facility accrue interest at libor plus a margin that depends on our credit ratings we pay a facility fee on the entire revolving commitment that depends on our credit ratings based on our credit ratings at january 31 2017 the margin on the facility was 105 and the facility fee was 020 the facility also includes a feature that allows us to increase the borrowing capacity by an aggregate amount of up to 500 million subject to securing additional commitments from existing lenders or new lending institutions at december 31 2016 we had 900 million including £372 million 460 million outstanding under the facility with a weighted average effective interest rate of 1821 in january 2017 we paid down 440 million on the facility primarily using proceeds from our ridea ii transaction 

on july 30 2012 we entered into a credit agreement with a syndicate of banks for a £137 million 169 million at december 31 2016 unsecured term loan which matures in 2017 based on our credit ratings at january 31 2017 the 2012 term loan accrues interest at a rate of gbp libor plus 140 

on january 12 2015 we entered into a credit agreement with a syndicate of banks for a £220 million 272 million at december 31 2016 fouryear unsecured term loan the “2015 term loan” that accrues interest at a rate of gbp libor plus 115 subject to adjustments based on our credit ratings the 2012 and 2015 term loans are collectively the “term loans” proceeds from the 2015 term loan were used to repay a £220 million draw on the facility that partially funded the november 2014 hcone facility see note 7 to the consolidated financial statements concurrently we entered into a threeyear interest rate swap agreement that effectively fixes the interest rate of the 2015 term loan 197 at december 31 2016 the 2015 term loan contains a oneyear committed extension option 

the facility and term loans contain certain financial restrictions and other customary requirements including crossdefault provisions to other indebtedness among other things these covenants using terms defined in the agreements i limit the ratio of consolidated total indebtedness to consolidated total asset value to 60 ii limit the ratio of secured debt to consolidated total asset value to 30 iii limit the ratio of unsecured debt to consolidated unencumbered asset value to 60 and iv require a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio of 15 times the facility and term loans also require a minimum consolidated tangible net worth of 65 billion at december 31 2016 which requirement was reduced via an amendment to the facility effective upon the completion of the spinoff of qcp on october 31 2016 at december 31 2016 we were in compliance with each of these restrictions and requirements of the facility and term loans 

senior unsecured notes at december 31 2016 we had senior unsecured notes outstanding with an aggregate principal balance of 72 billion interest rates on the notes ranged from 279 to 688 with a weighted average effective interest rate of 434 and a weighted average maturity of six years at december 31 2016 the senior unsecured notes contain certain covenants including limitations on debt maintenance of unencumbered assets crossacceleration provisions and other customary terms at december 31 2016 we believe we were in compliance with these covenants

mortgage debt generally requires monthly principal and interest payments is collateralized by real estate assets and is generally nonrecourse mortgage debt typically restricts transfer of the encumbered assets prohibits additional liens restricts prepayment requires payment of real estate taxes requires maintenance of the assets in good condition requires maintenance of insurance on the assets and includes conditions to obtain lender consent to enter into or terminate material leases some of the mortgage debt is also crosscollateralized by multiple assets and may require tenants or operators to maintain compliance with the applicable leases or operating agreements of such real estate assets 

 

  

equity 

at december 31 2016 we had 468 million shares of common stock outstanding equity totaled 59 billion and our equity securities had a market value of 141 billion 

at december 31 2016 nonmanaging members held an aggregate of 4 million units in five limited liability companies “downreits” for which we are the managing member the downreit units are exchangeable for an amount of cash approximating the thencurrent market value of shares of our common stock or at our option shares of our common stock subject to certain adjustments such as stock splits and reclassifications 

atthemarket program in june 2015 we established an atthemarket program in connection with the renewal of our shelf registration statement under this program we may sell shares of our common stock from time to time having an aggregate gross sales price of up to 750 million through a consortium of banks acting as sales agents or directly to the banks acting as principals there was no activity during the year ended december 31 2016 and as of december 31 2016 shares of our common stock having an aggregate gross sales price of 676 million were available for sale under the atthemarket program actual future sales will depend upon a variety of factors including but not limited to market conditions the trading price of our common stock and our capital needs we have no obligation to sell the remaining shares available for sale under our program 

  

shelf registration 

we filed a prospectus with the sec as part of a registration statement on form s3asr using a shelf registration process which expires in june 2018 under the “shelf” process we may sell any combination of the securities described in the prospectus through one or more offerings the securities described in the prospectus include common stock preferred stock depositary shares debt securities and warrants 

  

contractual obligations 

the following table summarizes our material contractual payment obligations and commitments at december 31 2016 in thousands 

















 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

we own interests in certain unconsolidated joint ventures as described under note 8 to the consolidated financial statements except in limited circumstances our risk of loss is limited to our investment in the joint venture and any outstanding loans receivable in addition we have certain properties which serve as collateral for debt that is owed by a previous owner of certain of our facilities as described under note 12 to the consolidated financial statements our risk of loss for these certain properties is limited to the outstanding debt balance plus penalties if any we have no other material offbalance sheet arrangements that we expect would materially affect our liquidity and capital resources except those described above under “contractual obligations” 

inflation 

our leases often provide for either fixed increases in base rents or indexed escalators based on the consumer price index or other measures andor additional rent based on increases in the tenants’ operating revenues most of our mob leases require the tenant to pay a share of property operating costs such as real estate taxes insurance and utilities substantially all of our senior housing life science and remaining other leases require the tenant or operator to pay all of the property operating costs or reimburse us for all such costs we believe that inflationary increases in expenses will be offset in part by the tenant or operator expense reimbursements and contractual rent increases described above

critical accounting policies 

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us gaap requires our management to use judgment in the application of accounting policies including making estimates and assumptions we base estimates on the best information available to us at the time our experience and on various other assumptions believed to be reasonable under the circumstances these estimates affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods if our judgment or interpretation of the facts and circumstances relating to various transactions or other matters had been different it is possible that different accounting would have been applied resulting in a different presentation of our consolidated financial statements from time to time we reevaluate our estimates and assumptions in the event estimates or assumptions prove to be different from actual results adjustments are made in subsequent periods to reflect more current estimates and assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain for a more detailed discussion of our significant accounting policies see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements below is a discussion of accounting policies that we consider critical in that they may require complex judgment in their application or require estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain 

  

principles of consolidation 

the consolidated financial statements include the accounts of hcp inc our whollyowned subsidiaries and joint ventures that we control through voting rights or other means we consolidate investments in variable interest entities “vies” when we are the primary beneficiary of the vie a variable interest holder is considered to be the primary beneficiary of a vie if it has the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the entity’s economic performance and has the obligation to absorb losses of or the right to receive benefits from the entity that could potentially be significant to the vie 

we make judgments about which entities are vies based on an assessment of whether i the equity investors as a group do not have a controlling financial interest ii the equity investment at risk is insufficient to finance that entity’s activities without additional subordinated financial support or iii substantially all of the entity’s activities involve or are performed on behalf of an equity investor that holds disproportionately few voting rights we make judgments with respect to our level of influence or control over an entity and whether we are or are not the primary beneficiary of a vie consideration of various factors includes but is not limited to our ability to direct the activities that most significantly impact the entity’s economic performance our form of ownership interest our representation on the entity’s governing body the size and seniority of our investment and our ability and the rights of other investors to participate in policy making decisions replace the manager andor liquidate the entity if applicable our ability to correctly assess our influence or control over an entity when determining the primary beneficiary of a vie affects the presentation of these entities in our consolidated financial statements when we perform a reanalysis of the primary beneficiary at a date other than at inception of the vie our assumptions may be different and may result in the identification of a different primary beneficiary 

if we determine that we are the primary beneficiary of a vie our consolidated financial statements would include the operating results of the vie rather than the results of the variable interest in the vie we would require the vie to provide us timely financial information and would review the internal controls of the vie to determine if we could rely on the financial information it provides if the vie has deficiencies in its internal controls over financial reporting or does not provide us with timely financial information this may adversely impact the quality andor timing of our financial reporting and our internal controls over financial reporting 

  

revenue recognition 

at the inception of a new lease arrangement including new leases that arise from amendments we assess the terms and conditions to determine the proper lease classification a lease arrangement is classified as an operating lease if none of the following criteria are met i transfer of ownership to the lessee prior to or shortly after the end of the lease term ii lessee has a bargain purchase option during or at the end of the lease term iii the lease term is equal to 75 or more of the underlying property’s economic life or iv the present value of future minimum lease payments excluding executory costs is equal to 90 or more of the excess estimated fair value over retained tax credits of the leased asset if one of the four criteria is met and the minimum lease payments are determined to be reasonably predictable and collectible the lease arrangement is generally accounted for as a direct financing lease if the assumptions utilized in the above classifications assessments were different our lease classification for accounting purposes may have been different thus 

 

the timing and amount of our revenue recognized would have been impacted which may be material to our consolidated financial statements 

we recognize rental revenue for operating leases on a straightline basis over the lease term when collectibility of all minimum lease payments is reasonably assured and the tenant has taken possession or controls the physical use of a leased asset if the lease provides for tenant improvements we determine whether the tenant improvements are owned by the tenant or us when we are the owner of the tenant improvements the tenant is not considered to have taken physical possession or have control of the leased asset until the tenant improvements are substantially complete when the tenant is the owner of the tenant improvements any tenant improvement allowance funded is treated as a lease incentive and amortized as a reduction of revenue over the lease term the determination of ownership of a tenant improvement is subject to significant judgment if our assessment of the owner of the tenant improvements was different the timing and amount of our revenue recognized would be impacted 

certain leases provide for additional rents that are contingent upon a percentage of the facility’s revenue in excess of specified base amounts or other thresholds such revenue is recognized when actual results reported by the tenant or estimates of tenant results exceed the base amount or other thresholds the recognition of additional rents requires us to make estimates of amounts owed and to a certain extent is dependent on the accuracy of the facility results reported to us our estimates may differ from actual results which could be material to our consolidated financial statements 

we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts including an allowance for operating lease straightline rent receivables for estimated losses resulting from tenant defaults or the inability of tenants to make contractual rent and tenant recovery payments we monitor the liquidity and creditworthiness of our tenants and operators on a continuous basis this evaluation considers industry and economic conditions property performance credit enhancements and other factors for straightline rent receivable amounts our assessment is based on income recoverable over the term of the lease we exercise judgment in establishing allowances and consider payment history and current credit status in developing these estimates these estimates may differ from actual results which could be material to our consolidated financial statements 

we use the direct finance method of accounting to record income from dfls for leases accounted for as dfls the net investment in the dfl represents receivables for the sum of future minimum lease payments receivable and the estimated residual values of the leased properties less the unamortized unearned income unearned income is deferred and amortized to income over the lease terms to provide a constant yield when collectibility of the lease payments is reasonably assured the determination of estimated useful lives and residual values are subject to significant judgment if these assessments were to change the timing and amount of our revenue recognized would be impacted 

loans receivable are classified as heldforinvestment based on management’s intent and ability to hold the loans for the foreseeable future or to maturity we recognize interest income on loans including the amortization of discounts and premiums using the interest method applied on a loanbyloan basis when collectibility of the future payments is reasonably assured premiums discounts and related costs are recognized as yield adjustments over the term of the related loans if management determined that certain loans should no longer be classified as heldforinvestment the timing and amount of our interest income recognized would be impacted 

loans receivable and dfls collectively “finance receivables” are reviewed and assigned an internal rating of performing watch list or workout finance receivables that are deemed performing meet all present contractual obligations and collection and timing of all amounts owed is reasonably assured watch list finance receivables are defined as finance receivables that do not meet the definition of performing or workout workout finance receivables are defined as finance receivables in which we have determined based on current information and events that i it is probable we will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the agreement ii the tenant operator or borrower is delinquent on making payments under the contractual terms of the agreement iii and we have commenced action or anticipate pursuing action in the near term to seek recovery of our investment 

 

finance receivables are placed on nonaccrual status when management determines that the collectibility of contractual amounts is not reasonably assured the asset will have an internal rating of either watch list or workout further we perform a credit analysis to support the tenant’s operator’s borrower’s andor guarantor’s repayment capacity and the underlying collateral values we use the cash basis method of accounting for finance receivables placed on nonaccrual status unless one of the following conditions exist whereby we utilize the cost recovery method of accounting i if we determine that it is probable that we will only recover the recorded investment in the finance receivable net of associated allowances or chargeoffs if any or ii we cannot reasonably estimate the amount of an impaired finance receivable for cash basis method of accounting we apply payments received excluding principal paydowns to interest income so long as that amount does not exceed the amount that would have been earned under the original contractual terms for cost recovery method of accounting any payment received is applied to reduce the recorded investment generally we return a finance receivable to accrual status when all delinquent payments become current under the terms of the loan or lease agreements and collectibility of the remaining contractual loan or lease payments is reasonably assured 

allowances are established for finance receivables on an individual basis utilizing an estimate of probable losses if they are determined to be impaired finance receivables are impaired when it is deemed probable that we will be unable to collect all amounts due in accordance with the contractual terms of the loan or lease an allowance is based upon our assessment of the lessee’s or borrower’s overall financial condition economic resources payment record the prospects for support from any financially responsible guarantors and if appropriate the net realizable value of any collateral these estimates consider all available evidence including the expected future cash flows discounted at the finance receivable’s effective interest rate fair value of collateral general economic conditions and trends historical and industry loss experience and other relevant factors as appropriate should a finance receivable be deemed partially or wholly uncollectible the uncollectible balance is charged off against the allowance in the period in which the uncollectible determination has been made 

  

real estate 

we make estimates as part of our process for allocating a purchase price to the various identifiable assets of an acquisition based upon the relative fair value of each asset the most significant components of our allocations are typically buildings asifvacant land and inplace leases in the case of allocating fair value to buildings and intangibles our fair value estimates will affect the amount of depreciation and amortization we record over the estimated useful life of each asset acquired or the remaining lease term in the case of allocating fair value to inplace leases we make our best estimates based on our evaluation of the specific characteristics of each tenant’s lease factors considered include estimates of carrying costs during hypothetical expected leaseup periods market conditions and costs to execute similar leases our assumptions affect the amount of future revenue that we will recognize over the remaining lease term for the acquired inplace leases 

a variety of costs are incurred in the development and leasing of properties after determination is made to capitalize a cost it is allocated to the specific component of a project that is benefited determination of when a development project is substantially complete and capitalization must cease involves a degree of judgment the costs of land and buildings under development include specifically identifiable costs the capitalized costs include preconstruction costs essential to the development of the property development costs construction costs interest costs real estate taxes and other costs incurred during the period of development we consider a construction project to be considered substantially complete and available for occupancy and cease capitalization of costs upon the completion of the related tenant improvements 

 

  

impairment of longlived assets 

we assess the carrying value of our real estate assets and related intangibles “real estate assets” when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the real estate assets may not be recoverable but at least annually recoverability of real estate assets is measured by comparing the carrying amount of the real estate assets to the respective estimated future undiscounted cash flows the estimated future undiscounted cash flows are calculated utilizing the lowest level of identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities in order to review our real estate assets for recoverability we consider market conditions as well as our intent with respect to holding or disposing of the asset if our analysis indicates that the carrying value of the real estate assets is not recoverable on an undiscounted cash flow basis we recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the real estate asset 

the determination of the fair value of real estate assets involves significant judgment this judgment is based on our analysis and estimates of fair value of real estate assets future operating results and resulting cash flows of each real estate asset whose carrying amount may not be recoverable our ability to accurately predict future operating results resulting cash flows and estimate and allocate fair values impacts the timing and recognition of impairments while we believe our assumptions are reasonable changes in these assumptions may have a material impact on our financial results 

  

investments in unconsolidated joint ventures 

the initial carrying value of investments in unconsolidated joint ventures is based on the amount paid to purchase the joint venture interest or the carrying value of the assets prior to the sale or contribution of the interests to the joint venture we evaluate our equity method investments for impairment indicators based upon a comparison of the fair value of the equity method investment to our carrying value if we determine there is a decline in the fair value of our investment in an unconsolidated joint venture below its carrying value and it is otherthantemporary an impairment is recorded the determination of the fair value of investments in unconsolidated joint ventures and as to whether a deficiency in fair value is “otherthantemporary” involves significant judgment our estimates consider all available evidence including as appropriate the present value of the expected future cash flows discounted at market rates general economic conditions and trends severity and duration of a fair value deficiency and other relevant factors capitalization rates discount rates and credit spreads utilized in our valuation models are based upon rates that we believe to be within a reasonable range of current market rates for the respective investments while we believe our assumptions are reasonable changes in these assumptions may have a material impact on our financial results 

  

income taxes 

as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements significant management judgment is required to evaluate our compliance with reit requirements our determinations are based on interpretation of tax laws and our conclusions may have an impact on the income tax expense recognized adjustments to income tax expense may be required as a result of i audits conducted by federal state and local tax authorities ii our ability to qualify as a reit iii the potential for builtin gain recognition and iv changes in tax laws adjustments required in any given period are included within the income tax provision

see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for the impact of new accounting standards 




 item 7 a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we are exposed to various market risks including the potential loss arising from adverse changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates specifically the gbp we use derivative financial instruments in the normal course of business to mitigate interest rate and foreign currency risk we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes derivatives are recorded on the consolidated balance sheets at fair value see note 24 to the consolidated financial statements 

 

to illustrate the effect of movements in the interest rate and foreign currency markets we performed a market sensitivity analysis on our hedging instruments we applied various basis point spreads to the underlying interest rate curves and foreign currency exchange rates of the derivative portfolio in order to determine the change in fair value assuming a one percentage point change in the underlying interest rate curve and foreign currency exchange rates the estimated change in fair value of each of the underlying derivative instruments would not exceed 3 million 

  

interest rate risk 

at december 31 2016 we are exposed to market risks related to fluctuations in interest rates primarily on variable rate debt as of december 31 2016 317 million of our variablerate debt was hedged by interest rate swap transactions the interest rate swaps are designated as cash flow hedges with the objective of managing the exposure to interest rate risk by converting the interest rates on our variablerate debt to fixed interest rates 

interest rate fluctuations will generally not affect our future earnings or cash flows on our fixed rate debt and assets until their maturity or earlier prepayment and refinancing if interest rates have risen at the time we seek to refinance our fixed rate debt whether at maturity or otherwise our future earnings and cash flows could adversely be affected by additional borrowing costs conversely lower interest rates at the time of refinancing may reduce our overall borrowing costs however interest rate changes will affect the fair value of our fixed rate instruments assuming a one percentage point change in interest rates would change the fair value of our fixed rate debt and investments by approximately 56 million and 8 million respectively and would not materially impact earnings or cash flows conversely changes in interest rates on variable rate debt and investments would change our future earnings and cash flows but not materially impact the fair value of those instruments assuming a one percentage point change in the interest rate related to our variablerate debt and variablerate investments and assuming no other changes in the outstanding balance as of december 31 2016 our annual interest expense and interest income would change by approximately 15 million and 1 million respectively 

  

  

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

at december 31 2016 our exposure to foreign currencies primarily relates to uk investments in leased real estate senior notes and related gbp denominated cash flows our foreign currency exposure is partially mitigated through the use of gbp denominated borrowings and foreign currency swap contracts based solely on our operating results for the year ended december 31 2016 including the impact of existing hedging arrangements if the value of the gbp relative to the us dollar were to increase or decrease by 10 compared to the average exchange rate during the year ended december 31 2016 our cash flows would have decreased or increased as applicable by less than 1 million 

  

market risk 

we have investments in marketable debt securities classified as heldtomaturity because we have the positive intent and ability to hold the securities to maturity heldtomaturity securities are recorded at amortized cost and adjusted for the amortization of premiums and discounts through maturity we consider a variety of factors in evaluating an otherthantemporary decline in value such as the length of time and the extent to which the market value has been less than our current adjusted carrying value the issuer’s financial condition capital strength and nearterm prospects any recent events specific to that issuer and economic conditions of its industry and our investment horizon in relationship to an anticipated nearterm recovery in the market value if any at december 31 2016 both the fair value and carrying value of marketable debt securities were 69 million

business strategy 

we invest and manage our real estate portfolio for the longterm to maximize the benefit to our stock holders and support the growth of our dividends the core elements of our strategy are i to acquire develop lease own and manage a diversified portfolio of quality healthcare properties across multiple business segments and geographic locations including europe ii to align ourselves with leading healthcare companies operators and service providers which over the longterm should result in higher relative rental rates net operating cash flows and appreciation of property values iii to allocate capital targeting a balanced portfolio between longerterm escalating triplenet leases with highquality tenants and operating businesses with shorterterm leases in our m edical office and   l ife s cience segments  iv to maintain adequate liquidity with longterm fixed rate debt financing with staggered maturities which supports the longerterm nature of our investments while reducing our exposure to interest rate volatility and refinancing risk at any point in the interest rate or credit cycles and v to continue to manage our balance sheet with a targeted financial leverage of 40 relative to our assets  

internal growth strategies 

we believe that our longerterm escalating triplenet leases with larger tenants and operators having scale enhance the quality stability and growth of our rental income further we believe many of our existing properties hold the potential for increased future cash flows as they are well maintained and in desirable locations within markets where the creation of new supply is limited by the lack of available sites and the difficulty of obtaining the necessary licensing other approvals andor financing our strategy for maximizing the benefits from these opportunities is to i work with new or existing tenants and operators to address their space and capital needs and ii provide highquality property management services in order to motivate tenants to renew expand or relocate into our properties 

we expect to continue our internal growth as a result of our ability to  







investment strategies 

the delivery of healthcare services requires real estate and as a result tenants and operators depend on real estate in part to maintain and grow their businesses we believe that the healthcare real estate market provides investment opportunities due to the i compelling longterm demographics driving the demand for healthcare services ii specialized nature of healthcare real estate investing and iii ongoing consolidation of the fragmented healthcare real estate sector  

while we emphasize healthcare real estate ownership we may also provide real estate secured financing to or invest in equity or debt securities of healthcare operators or other entities engaged in healthcare real estate ownership we may also acquire all or substantially all of the securities or assets of other reits operating companies or similar entities where such investments would be consistent with our investment strategies we may coinvest alongside institutional or development investors through partnerships or limited liability companies 

we monitor but do not limit our investments based on the percentage of our total assets that may be invested in any one property type investment vehicle or geographic location the number of properties that may be leased to a single tenant or operator or loans that may be made to a single borrower in allocating capital to our multiple segments we target opportunities with the most attractive riskreward profile for our portfolio as a whole we may take additional measures to 

 

mitigate risk including diversifying our investments by sector geography tenant or operator structuring transactions as master leases requiring tenant or operator insurance and indemnifications and obtaining credit enhancements in the form of guarantees letters of credit or security deposits 

we believe we are well positioned to achieve external growth through acquisitions financing and development other factors that contribute to our competitive position include  

  

















financing strategies 

o ur reit qualification requires us to distribute at least 90 of our reit taxable income  ex cluding net capital gains  therefore we don’t retain capital  as a result we regularly access the public equity and debt markets to raise the funds necessary to finance acquisitions and debt investments develop and redevelop properties and refinance maturing debt    

we may finance acquisitions and other investments through the following vehicles  









we maintain a disciplined balance sheet by actively managing our debt to equity levels and maintaining multiple sources of liquidity such as our revolving line of credit facility access to capital markets and secured debt lenders relationships with current and prospective institutional joint venture partners and our ability to divest of assets our debt obligations are primarily longterm fixed rate with staggered maturities which reduces the impact of rising interest rates on our operations  

we finance our investments based on our evaluation of available sources of funding for shortterm purposes we may utilize our revolving line of credit facility or arrange for other shortterm borrowings from banks or other sources we arrange for longerterm financing by offering debt and equity securities placing mortgage debt and obtaining capital from institutional lenders and joint venture partners  

  

 

  

competition 

investing in real estate serving the healthcare industry is highly competitive we face competition from other reits investment companies pension funds private equity and hedge fund investors sovereign funds healthcare operators lenders developers and other institutional investors some of whom may have greater flexibility eg nonreit competitors resources and lower costs of capital than we do increased competition makes it more challenging for us to identify and successfully capitalize on opportunities that meet our objectives our ability to compete may also be impacted by global national and local economic trends availability of investment alternatives availability and cost of capital construction and renovation costs existing laws and regulations new legislation and population trends 

income from our investments is dependent on the ability of our tenants and operators to compete with other companies on a number of different levels including the quality of care provided reputation success of product or drug development the physical appearance of a facility price and range of services offered alternatives for healthcare delivery the supply of competing properties physicians staff referral sources location the size and demographics of the population in surrounding areas and the financial condition of our tenants and operators private federal and state payment programs and government reimbursement as well as the effect of laws and regulations may also have a significant influence on the profitability of our tenants and operators for a discussion of the risks associated with competitive conditions affecting our business see “item 1a risk factors” in this report 

healthcare segments 

senior housing at december 31 2015 we had interests in 528 senior housing facilities including 22 properties owned by our unconsolidated joint ventures our senior housing facilities are managed utilizing triplenet leases and ridea structures and include independent living facilities “ilfs” assisted living facilities “alfs” memory care facilities “mcfs” care homes and continuing care retirement communities “ccrcs” which cater to different segments of the elderly population based upon their personal needs services provided by our tenants or operators in these facilities are primarily paid for by the residents directly or through private insurance and are less reliant on government reimbursement programs such as medicare and medicaid  

we have entered into longterm agreements with operators including brookdale senior living inc “brookdale” to manage properties that are operated under a ridea structure under the provisions of ridea a reit may lease a “qualified healthcare property” on an arm’s length basis to a taxable reit subsidiary “trs” if the property is managed on behalf of such subsidiary by a person who qualifies as an “eligible independent contractor” ridea structures allow us to own the risks and rewards of the operations of healthcare facilities as compared to leasing the property for contractual triplenet rents in a tax efficient manner we view ridea as a structure primarily to be used on properties that present attractive valuation entry points andor growth profiles by i transitioning the asset to a new operator that can bring scale operating efficiencies andor ancillary services or ii investing capital to reposition the asset brookdale provides comprehensive facility management and accounting services with respect to our senior housing ridea properties for which we pay annual management fees pursuant to the aforementioned agreements most of the management agreements have terms ranging from 10 to 15 years with 5year renewals the base management fees are 45 to 50 of gross revenues as defined generated by the ridea facilities in addition there are incentive management fees payable to brookdale if operating results of the ridea properties exceed preestablished ebitdar defined as earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization and rent thresholds as of december   3 1 2015 127 properties were under ridea structures 1 9 of which were owned by our unconsolidated joint venture s  

our senior housing property types under both triplenet leases and ridea structures are further described below

insurance 

we obtain various types of insurance to mitigate the impact of property business interruption liability flood windstorm earthquake environmental and terrorism related losses we attempt to obtain appropriate policy terms conditions limits and deductibles considering the relative risk of loss the cost of such coverage and current industry practice there are 

 

however certain types of extraordinary losses such as those due to acts of war or other events that may be either uninsurable or not economically insurable in addition we have a large number of properties that are exposed to earthquake flood and windstorm occurrences for which the related insurances carry higher deductibles 

we maintain property insurance for all of our properties  and this insurance is primary for our medical office life science and ridea facilities tenants under triplenet leases primarily in our senior housing postacuteskilled nursing and hospital segments are required to provide primary property business interruption and liability insurance we maintain separate general and professional liability insurance for our ridea facilities additionally our corporate general and professional liability insurance program also extends coverage for all of our properties beyond the aforementioned on an annual basis we review whether we or brookdale will bear responsibility for maintaining the required insurance coverage for the applicable properties but the costs of such insurance are facility expenses paid from the revenues of those properties regardless of who maintains the insurance 

  

employees of hcp 

at december 31 2015 we had 18 7 fulltime employees none of whom were subject to a collective bargaining agreement 

  

government regulation licensing and enforcement 

overview 

our tenants and operators are typically subject to extensive and complex federal state and local healthcare laws and regulations relating to quality of care licensure and certificate of need government reimbursement fraud and abuse practices and similar laws governing the operation of healthcare facilities and we expect that the healthcare industry in general will continue to face increased regulation and pressure in the areas of fraud waste and abuse cost control healthcare management and provision of services among others these regulations are wide ranging and can subject our tenants and operators to civil criminal and administrative sanctions affected tenants and operators may find it increasingly difficult to comply with this complex and evolving regulatory environment because of a relative lack of guidance in many areas as certain of our healthcare properties are subject to oversight from several government agencies  and the laws may vary from one jurisdiction to another changes in laws regulations reimbursement enforcement activity and regulatory non  compliance by our tenants and operators can all have a significant effect on their operations and financial condition which in turn may adversely impact us as detailed below and set forth under “item 1a risk factors” in this report  

based on information primarily provided by our tenants and operators excluding our medical office segment at december 31 2015 we estimate that approximately 13 and 12 of the annualized base rental payments received from our tenants and operators were dependent on medicare and medicaid reimbursement respectively 

the following is a discussion of certain laws and regulations generally applicable to our operators and in certain cases to us 

fraud and abuse enforcement 

there are various extremely complex us federal and state laws and regulations and in relation to our facilities located in the uk national laws and regulations of england scotland northern ireland and wales governing healthcare providers’ relationships and arrangements and prohibiting fraudulent and abusive practices by such providers these laws include i us federal state false claims acts and uk antifraud legislation and regulation which among other things prohibit providers from filing false claims or making false statements to receive payment from medicare medicaid or other us federal or state or uk healthcare programs ii us federal state antikickback and feesplitting statutes including the medicare and medicaid antikickback statute which prohibit or restrict the payment or receipt of remuneration to induce referrals or recommendations of healthcare items or services and uk legislation and regulations on financial inducements and vested interests iii us federal and state physician selfreferral laws commonly referred to as the “stark law” which generally prohibit referrals by physicians to entities with which the physician or an immediate family member has a financial relationship iv the federal civil monetary penalties law which prohibits among other things the knowing presentation of a false or fraudulent claim for certain healthcare services and v us federal state and uk privacy laws including the privacy and security rules contained in the health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 commonly referred to as “hipaa” and the uk data protection act 1988 which provide for the privacy and security of personal health information violations of us and uk healthcare fraud and abuse laws 

 

carry civil criminal and administrative sanctions including punitive sanctions monetary penalties imprisonment denial of medicare and medicaid reimbursement and potential exclusion from medicare medicaid or other federal or state healthcare programs these laws are enforced by a variety of federal state and local agencies and in the us can also be enforced by private litigants through among other things federal and state false claims acts which allow private litigants to bring qui tam or “whistleblower” actions many of our tenants and operators are subject to these laws and may become the subject of governmental enforcement actions if they fail to comply with applicable laws  

reimbursement 

sources of revenue for many of our tenants and operators include among others governmental healthcare programs such as the federal medicare programs and state medicaid programs and in the uk the national health service “nh s” and local authority funding  and nongovernmental thirdparty payors such as insurance carriers and hmos as federal and state governments focus on healthcare reform initiatives and as the federal government many states face significant current and future budget deficits efforts to reduce costs by these payors will likely continue which may result in reduced or slower growth in reimbursement for certain services provided by some of our tenants and operators similarly in the uk the nhs and the local authorities are undertaking efforts to reduce costs which may result in reduced or slower growth in reimbursement for certain services provided by our uk    tenants and operators  additionally new and evolving payor and provider programs in the us including but not limited to medicare advantage dual eligible accountable care organizations “aco” and bundled payments could adversely impact our tenants’ and operators’ liquidity financial condition or results of operations    

healthcare licensure and certificate of need 

certain healthcare facilities in our portfolio including our facilities located in the uk are subject to extensive national federal state and local licensure certification and inspection laws and regulations in addition various licenses and permits are required to handle controlled substances including narcotics operate pharmacies handle radioactive materials and operate equipment many states in the us require certain healthcare providers to obtain a certificate of need which requires prior approval for the construction expansion or closure of certain healthcare facilities the approval process related to state certificate of need laws may impact some of our tenants’ and operators’ abilities to expand or change their businesses  

life science facilities 

while certain of our life science tenants include some wellestablished companies other tenants are less established and in some cases may not yet have a product approved by the food and drug administration or other regulatory authorities for commercial sale creating a new pharmaceutical product or medical device requires substantial investments of time and capital in part because of the extensive regulation of the healthcare industry it also entails considerable risk of failure in demonstrating that the product is safe and effective and in gaining regulatory approval and market acceptance 

senior housing entrance fee communities 

certain of our senior housing facilities are operated as entrance fee communities generally an entrance fee is an upfront fee or consideration paid by a resident a portion of which may be refundable in exchange for some form of longterm benefit some of the entrance fee communities are subject to significant state regulatory oversight including for example oversight of each facility’s financial condition establishment and monitoring of reserve requirements and other financial restrictions the right of residents to cancel their contracts within a specified period of time lien rights in favor of the residents restrictions on change of ownership and similar matters 

americans with disabilities act the “ada” 

our properties must comply with the ada and any similar state or local laws to the extent that such properties are “public accommodations” as defined in those statutes the ada may require removal of barriers to access by persons with disabilities in certain public areas of our properties where such removal is readily achievable to date we have not received any notices of noncompliance with the ada that have caused us to incur substantial capital expenditures to address ada concerns should barriers to access by persons with disabilities be discovered at any of our properties we may be directly or indirectly responsible for additional costs that may be required to make facilities adacompliant noncompliance with the ada could result in the imposition of fines or an award of damages to private litigants the obligation to make readily achievable accommodations pursuant to the ada is an ongoing one and we continue to assess our properties and make 

 

modifications as appropriate in this respect 

environmental matters 

a wide variety of federal state and local environmental and occupational health and safety laws and regulations affect healthcare facility operations these complex federal and state statutes and their enforcement involve a myriad of regulations many of which involve strict liability on the part of the potential offender some of these federal and state statutes may directly impact us under various federal state and local environmental laws ordinances and regulations an owner of real property or a secured lender such as us may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of hazardous or toxic substances at under or disposed of in connection with such property as well as other potential costs relating to hazardous or toxic substances including government fines and damages for injuries to persons and adjacent property the cost of any required remediation removal fines or personal or property damages and any related liability therefore could exceed or impair the value of the property andor the assets in addition the presence of such substances or the failure to properly dispose of or remediate such substances may adversely affect the value of such property and the owner’s ability to sell or rent such property or to borrow using such property as collateral which in turn could reduce our earnings for a description of the risks associated with environmental matters see “item 1a risk factors” in this report

 item 1a  risk factors   

the section below discusses the most significant risk factors that may materially adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

as set forth below we believe that the risks we face generally fall into the following categories 









  

  

risks related to our business and operations 

we depend on a limited number of tenants and operators for a large percentage of our revenues   and net operating income  

we manage our facilities utilizing lease and ridea structures under our lease arrangements we generated 33 of our revenues from hcrmc 23 and brookdale 10 during the year ended december 31 2015 hcrmc is an operator that primarily provides postacute care skilled nursing care and assisted living services and relies heavily on government reimbursement programs such as medicare and medicaid  

in addition to our lease arrangement with brookdale under ridea structures we generated 8  of our net operating   

 

income from properties managed by brookdale during the year ended december 31 2015  services provided by our tenants or operators in facilities managed under a ridea structure are primarily paid for by the residents directly or through private insurance and are less reliant on government reimbursement programs we report the resident level fees and services revenues and corresponding operating expenses in our consolidated financial statements  

the inability or other failure of either hcrmc under its lease agreements or brookdale under its lease agreements and ridea structures to meet their obligations to us could materially reduce our cash flow net operating income and results of operations which could in turn reduce the amount of dividends we pay to our stockholders cause our stock price to decline and have other materially adverse effects on our business results of operations and financial condition  

in addition any failure by hcrmc or brookdale to effectively conduct their operations or to maintain and improve our properties could adversely affect their business reputation and their ability to attract and retain patients and residents in our properties which could have a materially adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition furthermore they each face an increasingly competitive labor market for skilled management personnel and nurses which can cause operating costs to increase while hcrmc and brookdale generally have also agreed to indemnify defend and hold us harmless from and against various claims litigation and liabilities arising in connection with their respective businesses they may have insufficient assets income access to financing andor insurance coverage to enable them to satisfy their indemnification obligations  

the real estate portfolio that we have master leased to hcrmc accounts for a significant portion of our assets and revenues adverse regulatory and operational developments in hcrmc’s business and financial condition have had and could continue to have an adverse effect on us  

hcrmc a provider of a range of healthcare services primarily in postacute care skilled nursing care and assisted living is our largest tenant representing 23 of our gross assets and revenues as of and for the year ended december 31 2015 in april 2011 we completed a 6 billion acquisition of substantially all the real estate assets of and an equity interest in hcrmc in the first quarter 2015 we recorded an impairment charge of 478 million related to the real estate portfolio master leased to hcrmc based on the present value of the future lease payments under the amendment to the master lease with hcrmc that became effective april 1 2015 as a result of hcrmc’s fourth quarter 2015 performance deterioration and related decline in fixed charge coverage we subsequently placed the real estate portfolio master leased to hcrmc on “ w atch l ist” status effective at yearend 2015 and changed our accounting treatment to recognize rental income on a cash basis beginning january 1 2016 furthermore hcrmc’s preliminary 2016 forecast indicates only limited improvement in its fixed charge coverage and free cash flow after capital expenditures in 2016 accordingly we assessed the value of this real estate portfolio including obtaining an independent valuation appraisal of our postacute  skilled nursing and senior housing facilities as a result we reduced the carrying value of this real estate portfolio to  52 billion approximating its estimated market value which resulted in an impairment charge of  817 million recorded in the fourth quarter of 2015  

in the fourth quarter of 2014 and the third quarter of 2015 we recorded impairment charges of 36 million and 27 million respectively for our equity ownership interest in hcrmc these impairment charges resulted primarily from our review of their 2015 preliminary base financial forecast operating results and other financial information provided by hcrmc as well as market and industry data that among other factors showed a declining trend in admissions from hospitals and continuing trends in mix and length of stay driven by medicare advantage and other m anaged c are plans as a result of hcrmc’s fourth quarter 2015 performance deterioration we recorded an additional impairment charge of 19 million for our equity ownership in hcrmc reducing its carrying value to zero 

on april 20 2015 the   doj unsealed a previously filed complaint in the united states district court for the eastern district of virginia against hcrmc and certain of its affiliates in three consolidated cases following a civil investigation arising out of three lawsuits filed by former employees of hcrmc under the qui tam provisions of the federal false claims act the complaint alleges that hcrmc submitted claims to medicare for therapy services that were not covered by the skilled nursing facility benefit were not medically reasonable and necessary and were not skilled in nature and therefore not entitled to medicare reimbursement hcrmc incurred legal and regulatory defense costs of 3 million and 9 million during the fourth quarter and full year 2015 respectively while the doj litigation is at an early stage and hcrmc has indicated that it believes the claims are unjust and it will vigorously defend against them the ultimate outcome is uncertain and could among other things cause hcrmc to i incur substantial additional time and costs to respond to and defend 

 

hcrmc’s actions in the litigation with the doj and any other thirdparty payors ii refund or adjust amounts previously paid for services under governmental programs and to change business operations going forward in a manner that negatively impacts future revenue iii pay substantial fines and penalties and incur other administrative sanctions including having to conduct future business operations pursuant to a corporate integrity agreement which may be with the office of inspector general of the department of health and human services iv lose the right to participate in the medicare or medicaid programs and v suffer damage to hcrmc’s reputation in addition any settlement in the doj litigation with or without an admission of wrongdoing may include a substantial monetary component that could have a material adverse effect on hcrmc’s liquidity and financial condition that makes it difficult or not possible for hcrmc to meet its obligations under its amended master lease with us  

continued deterioration in hcrmc’s operating performance business or financial condition or adverse regulatory developments could further reduce the revenues we earn under our master lease with hcrmc further impair the value of our master lease with hcrmc and result in among other adverse events acceleration of hcrmc’s indebtedness impairment of its continued access to capital the enforcement of default remedies by its counterparties or the commencement of insolvency proceedings by or against it under the us bankruptcy code any one or a combination of which could have a materially adverse effect on us  

see additional information regarding the aforementioned impairment charges equity interest in hcrmc and master lease with hcrmc in i item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations—2015 transaction overview” and ii note 6 net investment in direct financing leases note 8 investments in and advances to unconsolidated joint ventures note 17 impairments and note 23 concentration of credit risk to the consolidated financial statements  

the properties managed by brookdale account for a significant portion of our revenues and operating income adverse developments in brookdale’s business and affairs or financial condition could have a materially adverse effect on us  

as of december 31 2015 brookdale managed 108 senior housing facilities that we own and 15 ccrcs owned by our unconsolidated joint venture pursuant to longterm management agreements for the year ended december 31 2015 these properties represented 12 and 10 of our gross assets and revenues respectively although we have various rights as the property owner under our management agreements we rely on brookdale’s personnel expertise technical resources and information systems proprietary information good faith and judgment to manage our senior living operations efficiently and effectively we also rely on brookdale to set appropriate resident fees to provide accurate propertylevel financial results for our properties in a timely manner and to otherwise operate our senior housing communities in compliance with the terms of our management agreements and all applicable laws and regulations    

in its capacity as a manager brookdale does not lease our properties and therefore we are not directly exposed to their credit risk in the same manner or to the same extent as a triplenet tenant however any adverse developments in brookdale’s business and affairs or financial condition could impair its ability to manage our properties efficiently and effectively and could have a materially adverse effect on us brookdale is also one of our triplenet tenants if brookdale experiences any significant financial legal accounting or regulatory difficulties due to a weak economy or otherwise such difficulties could result in among other adverse events acceleration of its indebtedness impairment of its continued access to capital the enforcement of default remedies by its counterparties or the commencement of insolvency proceedings by or against it under the us bankruptcy code any one or a combination of which indirectly could have a materially adverse effect on us  

the bankruptcy insolvency or financial deterioration of one or more of our major tenants operators or borrowers may materially adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition  

we lease our properties directly to operators in most cases and in certain other cases we lease to third party tenants who enter into longterm management agreements with operators to manage the properties we are also a direct or indirect lender to various tenants and operators although our leases financing arrangements and other agreements with our tenants and operators generally provide us the right under specified circumstances to terminate a lease evict a tenant or operator or demand immediate repayment of certain obligations to us the bankruptcy and insolvency laws afford certain rights to a party that has filed for bankruptcy or reorganization that may render certain of these remedies unenforceable or at the 

 

least delay our ability to pursue such remedies for example we cannot evict a tenant or operator solely because of its bankruptcy filing a debtor has the right to assume or to assume and assign to a third party or to reject its unexpired contracts in a bankruptcy proceeding if a debtor were to reject its leases with us our claim against the debtor for unpaid and future rents would be limited by the statutory cap set forth in the us bankruptcy code which may be substantially less than the remaining rent actually owed under the lease in addition a debtor may assert in a bankruptcy proceeding that our lease should be recharacterized as a financing agreement in which case our rights and remedies as a lender compared to a landlord generally would be more limited  

also if a debtormanager seeks bankruptcy protection the automatic stay provisions of the us bankruptcy code would preclude us from enforcing our remedies against the manager unless relief is first obtained from the court having jurisdiction over the bankruptcy case in any of these events we also may be required to fund certain expenses and obligations eg real estate taxes insurance debt costs and maintenance expenses to preserve the value of our properties avoid the imposition of liens on our properties or transition our properties to a new tenant operator or manager furthermore many of our facilities are leased to healthcare providers who provide longterm custodial care to the elderly evicting such operators for failure to pay rent while the facility is occupied may involve specific procedural requirements and may not be successful  

additionally the financial weakness or other inability of our tenants operators or borrowers to make payments or comply with certain other lease obligations may affect our compliance with certain covenants contained in our debt securities credit facilities and the mortgages on the properties leased or managed by such tenants and operators or otherwise adversely affect our results of operations under certain conditions defaults under the underlying mortgages may result in cross default under our other indebtedness although we may be able to secure amendments under the applicable agreements in those circumstances the bankruptcy of an applicable tenant or operator may potentially result in less favorable borrowing terms than currently available delays in the availability of funding or other materially adverse consequences  

increased competition has resulted and may further result in lower net revenues for some of our tenants operators and borrowers and may affect their ability to meet their financial and other contractual obligations to us  

the healthcare industry is highly competitive the occupancy levels at and rental income from our facilities are dependent on our ability and the ability of our tenants operators and borrowers to compete with other tenants and operators on a number of different levels including the quality of care provided reputation the physical appearance of a facility price the range of services offered family preference alternatives for healthcare delivery the supply of competing properties physicians staff referral sources location and the size and demographics of the population in the surrounding area in addition our tenants operators and borrowers face an increasingly competitive labor market for skilled management personnel and nurses an inability to attract and retain skilled management personnel and nurses and other trained personnel could negatively impact the ability of our tenants operators and borrowers to meet their obligations to us a shortage of nurses or other trained personnel or general inflationary pressures on wages may force tenants operators and borrowers to enhance pay and benefits packages to compete effectively for skilled personnel or to use more expensive contract personnel but they be unable to offset these added costs by increasing the rates charged to residents any increase in labor costs and other property operating expenses or any failure by our tenants operators or borrowers to attract and retain qualified personnel could adversely affect our cash flow and have a materially adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition  

our tenants operators and borrowers also compete with numerous other companies providing similar healthcare services or alternatives such as home health agencies life care at home communitybased service programs retirement communities and convalescent centers this competition which is due in part to over development in some segments in which we invest has caused the occupancy rate of newly constructed buildings to slow and the monthly rate that many newly built and previously existing facilities were able to obtain for their services to decrease we cannot be certain that our tenants operators and borrowers will be able to achieve occupancy and rate levels and to manage their expenses in a way that will enable them to meet all of their obligations to us further many competing companies may have resources and attributes that are superior to those of our tenants operators and borrowers they may encounter increased competition that could limit their ability to maintain or attract residents or expand their businesses or to manage their expenses either of which could materially adversely affect their ability to meet their financial and other contractual obligations to us potentially decreasing our revenues impairing our assets andor increasing our collection and dispute costs    

 

competition may make it difficult to identify and purchase or develop suitable healthcare facilities to grow our investment portfolio to finance acquisitions on favorable terms or to retain or attract tenants and operators  

we face significant competition from other reits investment companies private equity and hedge fund investors sovereign funds healthcare operators lenders developers and other institutional investors some of whom may have greater resources and lower costs of capital than we do increased competition makes it more challenging for us to identify and successfully capitalize on opportunities that meet our business goals and could improve the bargaining power of property owners seeking to sell thereby impeding our investment acquisition and development activities similarly our properties face competition for tenants and operators from other properties in the same market which may affect our ability to attract and retain tenants and operators or may reduce the rents we are able to charge if we cannot capitalize on our development pipeline identify and purchase a sufficient quantity of healthcare facilities at favorable prices finance acquisitions on commercially favorable terms or attract and retain profitable tenants and operators our business results of operations and financial condition may be materially adversely affected  

economic and other conditions that negatively affect geographic areas to which a greater percentage of our revenue is attributed could materially adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition  

for the year ended december 31 2015 35 of our revenue was derived from properties located in california 2 2  and texas 1 3  as a result we may be subject to increased exposure to adverse conditions affecting these regions including downturns in the local economies or changes in local real estate conditions increased competition or decreased demand changes in statespecific legislation and local climate events and natural disasters such as earthquakes wildfires and hurricanes which could adversely affect our business and results of operations  

we may be required to incur substantial renovation costs to make certain of our healthcare properties suitable for other tenants and operators  

healthcare facilities are typically highly customized and may not be easily adapted to nonhealthcarerelated uses the improvements generally required to conform a property to healthcare use such as upgrading electrical gas and plumbing infrastructure are costly and at times tenantspecific a new or replacement tenant or operator may require different features in a property depending on that tenant’s or operator’s particular business if a current tenant or operator is unable to pay rent andor vacates a property we may incur substantial expenditures to modify a property before we are able to secure another tenant or operator or to accommodate multiple tenants or operators these expenditures or renovations may materially adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition  

we face additional risks associated with property development that can render a project less profitable or not profitable at all and under certain circumstances prevent completion of development activities once undertaken 

property development is a component of our growth strategy at december 31 2015 our actual investment and estimated commitments   under our development platform including land held for redevelopment represented approximately  721 million or 3 of our total assets largescale groundup development of healthcare properties presents additional risks for us including risks that  











 



any of the foregoing risks could materially adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition  

our use of joint ventures may limit our flexibility with jointly owned investments  

we have and may continue in the future to develop andor acquire properties in joint ventures with other persons or entities when circumstances warrant the use of these structures our participation in joint ventures is subject to risks that may not be present with other methods of ownership including  













any of the foregoing risks could materially adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

from time to time we acquire other companies and if we are unable to successfully integrate these operations our business results of operations and financial condition may be materially adversely affected  

acquisitions require the integration of companies that have previously operated independently successful integration of the operations of these companies depends primarily on our ability to consolidate operations systems procedures properties and personnel and to eliminate redundancies and costs we may encounter difficulties in these integrations potential difficulties associated with acquisitions include the loss of key employees the disruption of our ongoing business or that of the acquired entity possible inconsistencies in standards controls procedures and policies and the assumption of unexpected liabilities including  











in addition the acquired companies and their properties may fail to perform as expected including in respect of estimated cost savings inaccurate assumptions regarding future rental or occupancy rates could result in overly optimistic estimates of future revenues similarly we may underestimate future operating expenses or the costs necessary to bring properties up to standards established for their intended use if we have difficulties with any of these areas or if we later discover additional liabilities or experience unforeseen costs relating to our acquired companies we might not achieve the economic benefits we expect from our acquisitions and this may materially adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition  

 

from time to time we have made and in the future we may seek to make one or more material acquisitions which may involve the expenditure of significant funds  

we regularly review potential transactions in order to maximize stockholder value future acquisitions may require the issuance of securities the incurrence of debt assumption of contingent liabilities or incurrence of significant expenditures each of which could materially adversely impact our business financial condition or results of operations in addition the financing required for such acquisitions may not be available on commercially favorable terms or at all  

our tenants operators and borrowers face litigation and may continue to experience rising liability and insurance costs  

in some states advocacy groups have been created to monitor the quality of care at healthcare facilities and these groups have brought litigation against the tenants and operators of such facilities also in several instances private litigation by patients has resulted in large damage awards for alleged abuses the effect of this litigation and other potential litigation may materially increase the costs incurred by our tenants operators and borrowers for monitoring and reporting quality of care compliance in addition their cost of liability and medical malpractice insurance can be significant and may increase or not be available at a reasonable cost so long as the present healthcare litigation environment continues cost increases could cause our tenants and operators to be unable to make their lease or mortgage payments or fail to purchase the appropriate liability and malpractice insurance or cause our borrowers to be unable to meet their obligations to us potentially decreasing our revenues and increasing our collection and litigation costs in addition as a result of our ownership of healthcare facilities we may be named as a defendant in lawsuits arising from the alleged actions of our tenants or operators for which claims such tenants and operators have agreed to indemnify us but which may require unanticipated expenditures on our part  

the requirements of or changes to governmental reimbursement programs such as medicare or medicaid may adversely affect our tenants’ operators’ and borrowers’ ability to meet their financial and other contractual obligations to us  

certain of our tenants operators and borrowers are affected directly or indirectly by an extremely complex set of federal state and local laws and regulations pertaining to governmental reimbursement programs such laws and regulations are subject to frequent and substantial changes that are sometimes applied retroactively see “item 1—business—government regulation licensing and enforcement” above for example to the extent that any of our tenants or operators receive a significant portion of their revenues from governmental payors primarily medicare and medicaid such revenues may be subject to  



















if our tenants operators or borrowers directly or indirectly fail to comply with the extensive laws regulations and other requirements applicable to their business and the operation of our properties they could become ineligible to receive reimbursement from governmental reimbursement programs face bans on admissions of new patients or residents suffer civil or criminal penalties or be required to make significant changes to their operations these laws and regulations are enforced by a variety of federal state and local agencies and can also be enforced by private litigants through among other things federal and state false claims acts which allow private litigants to bring qui tam or “whistleblower” actions for 

 

example one of our borrowers tandem health care has an operator of its facilities consulate health care “consulate” facing a qui tam or “whistleblower” action alleging that consulate overbilled the federal government and the state of florida our tenants operators and borrow er s could be adversely affected by the resources required to respond to an investigation or other enforcement action in such event the results of operations and financial condition of our tenants and the results of operations of our properties operated by those entities could be materially adversely affected which in turn could have a materially adverse effect on us we are unable to predict future federal state and local regulations and legislation including the medicare and medicaid statutes and regulations or the intensity of enforcement efforts with respect to such regulations and legislation and any changes in the regulatory framework could have a materially adverse effect on our tenants which in turn could have a materially adverse effect on us  

in recent years governmental payors have frozen or reduced payments to healthcare provide rs due to budgetary pressures healthcare reimbursement will likely continue to be of significant importance to federal and state authorities we cannot make any assessment as to the ultimate timing or the effect that any future legislative reforms may have on our tenants’ operators’ and borrowers’ costs of doing business and on the amount of reimbursement by government and other thirdparty payors the failure of any of our tenants operators or borrowers to comply with these laws and regulations and significant limits on the scope of services reimbursed and on reimbursement rates and fees could materially adversely affect their ability to meet their financial and contractual obligations to us  

legislation to address federal government operations and administration decisions affecting the centers for medicare and medicaid services could have a materially adverse effect on our tenants’ operators’ and borrowers’ liquidity financial condition or results of operations  

congressional consideration of legislation pertaining to the federal debt ceiling the affordable care act as defined below tax reform and entitlement programs including reimbursement rates for physicians could have a materially adverse effect on our tenants’ operators’ and borrowers’ liquidity financial condition or results of operations in particular changes in funding for entitlement programs such as medicare and medicaid may result in increased costs and fees for programs such as medicare advantage plans and additional reductions in reimbursements to providers additionally amendments to the patient protection and affordable care act along with the health care and education reconciliation act of 2010 collectively the “affordable care act” implementation of the affordable care act and decisions by the centers for medicare and medicaid services could impact the delivery of services and benefits under medicare medicaid or medicare advantage plans and could affect our tenants and operators and the manner in which they are reimbursed by such programs such changes could have a materially adverse effect on our tenants’ operators’ and borrowers’ liquidity financial condition or results of operations which could adversely affect their ability to satisfy their obligations to us and could have a materially adverse effect on us  

furthermore the supreme court’s decision upholding the constitutionality of the individual healthcare mandate while striking down the provisions linking federal funding of state medicaid programs with a federally mandated expansion of those programs has contributed to the uncertainty regarding the impact that the law will have on healthcare delivery systems over the next decade we can expect that federal authorities will continue to implement the law but because of the supreme court’s mixed ruling the implementation will take longer than originally expected with a commensurate increase in the period of uncertainty regarding the longterm financial impact on the delivery of and payment for healthcare  

tenants and operators that fail to comply with federal state local and international laws and regulations including licensure certification and inspection requirements may cease to operate or be unable to meet their financial and other contractual obligations to us  

our tenants operators and borrowers are subject to or impacted by extensive frequently changing federal state local and international laws and regulations these laws and regulations include among others laws protecting consumers against deceptive practices laws relating to the operation of our properties and how our tenants and operators conduct their operations such as fire health and safety laws and privacy laws federal and state laws affecting hospitals clinics and other healthcare communities that participate in both medicare and medicaid that mandate allowable costs pricing reimbursement procedures and limitations quality of services and care food service and physical plants and similar foreign laws regulating the healthcare industry resident rights laws including abuse and neglect laws and fraud laws antikickback and physician referral laws the ada and similar state and local laws and safety and health standards set by the occupational safety and health administration or similar foreign agencies certain of our properties may also require a license registration andor certificate of need to operate 

 

our tenants’ operators’ or borrowers’ failure to comply with any of these laws regulations or requirements could result in loss of accreditation denial of reimbursement imposition of fines suspension or decertification from government healthcare programs loss of license or closure of the facility andor the incurrence of considerable costs arising from an investigation or regulatory action which may have an adverse effect on facilities owned by or mortgaged to us and therefore may materially adversely impact us see “item 1—business—government regulation licensing and enforcement—healthcare licensure and certificate of need” above  

our tenants in the life science industry face high levels of regulation expense and uncertainty  

life science tenants particularly those involved in developing and marketing pharmaceutical products are subject to certain unique risks including the following  











if our tenants’ businesses are adversely affected they may have difficulty making payments to us which could materially adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition  

we may be unable to successfully foreclose on the collateral securing our real estaterelated loans and even if we are successful in our foreclosure efforts we may be unable to successfully operate occupy or reposition the underlying real estate which may adversely affect our ability to recover our investments  

if a tenant or operator defaults under one of our mortgages or mezzanine loans we may have to foreclose on the loan or protect our interest by acquiring title to the collateral and thereafter making substantial improvements or repairs in order to maximize the property’s investment potential in some cases the collateral consists of the equity interests in an entity that directly or indirectly owns the applicable real property or interests in operating facilities and accordingly we may not have full recourse to assets of that entity tenants operators or borrowers may contest enforcement of foreclosure or other remedies seek bankruptcy protection against our exercise of enforcement or other remedies andor bring claims for lender liability in response to actions to enforce mortgage obligations foreclosurerelated costs high loantovalue ratios or declines in the value of the facility may prevent us from realizing an amount equal to our mortgage or mezzanine loan upon foreclosure and we may be required to record a valuation allowance for such losses even if we are able to successfully foreclose on the collateral securing our real estaterelated loans we may inherit properties for which we may be unable to expeditiously secure tenants or operators if at all or we may acquire equity interests that we are unable to immediately resell due to limitations under the securities laws either of which would adversely affect our ability to fully recover our investment  

required regulatory approvals can delay or prohibit transfers of our healthcare facilities  

transfers of healthcare facilities to successor tenants or operators may be subject to regulatory approvals or ratifications including but not limited to change of ownership approvals under certificate of need laws and medicare and medicaid provider arrangements that are not required for transfers of other types of commercial operations and other types of real estate the replacement of any tenant or operator could be delayed by the regulatory approval process of any federal state or local government agency necessary for the transfer of the facility or the replacement of the operator licensed to manage the facility if we are unable to find a suitable replacement tenant or operator upon favorable terms or at all we may take possession of a facility which might expose us to successor liability require us to indemnify subsequent operators to 

 

whom we might transfer the operating rights and licenses or spend substantial time and funds to adapt the facility to other uses all of which may materially adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition  

  

risks related to our capital structure and market conditions 

we rely on external sources of capital to fund future capital needs and if access to such capital is unavailable on acceptable terms or at all it could have a materially adverse effect on our ability to meet commitments as they become due or make future investments necessary to grow our business  

we may not be able to fund all future capital needs from cash retained from operations if we are unable to obtain enough internal capital we may need to rely on external sources of capital including debt and equity financing to fulfill our capital requirements our access to capital depends upon a number of factors some of which we have little or no control over including but not limited to  





















if access to capital is unavailable on acceptable terms or at all it could have a materially adverse impact on our ability to fund operations repay or refinance our debt obligations fund dividend payments acquire properties and make the investments needed to grow our business  

adverse changes in our credit ratings could impair our ability to obtain additional debt and equity financing on favorable terms if at all and negatively impact the market price of our securities including our common stock  

our credit ratings can affect the amount and type of capital we can access as well as the terms of any financings we may obtain we may be unable to maintain our current credit ratings and in the event that our current credit ratings deteriorate we would likely incur higher borrowing costs and it may be more difficult or expensive to obtain additional financing or refinance existing obligations and commitments also a downgrade in our credit ratings would trigger additional costs or other potentially negative consequences under our current and future credit facilities and debt instruments the credit ratings of our senior unsecured debt are based on among other things our operating performance liquidity and leverage ratios overall financial position level of indebtedness and pending or future changes in the regulatory framework applicable to our operators and our industry  

our level of indebtedness may increase and materially adversely affect our future operations 

our outstanding indebtedness as of december 31 2015 was approximately 111 billion we may incur additional indebtedness in the future including in connection with the development or acquisition of assets which may be substantial any significant additional indebtedness could negatively affect the credit ratings of our debt and require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow to interest and principal payments due on our indebtedness greater demands on our cash resources may reduce funds available to us to pay dividends conduct development activities make capital 

 

expenditures and acquisitions or carry out other aspects of our business strategy increased indebtedness can also make us more vulnerable to general adverse economic and industry conditions and create competitive disadvantages for us compared to other companies with relatively lower debt levels increased future debt service obligations may limit our operational flexibility including our ability to finance or refinance our properties contribute properties to joint ventures or sell properties as needed  

an increase in interest rates could increase interest cost on new debt and could materially adversely impact our ability to refinance existing debt sell assets and conduct acquisition investment and development activities  

if interest rates increase so could our interest costs for any variable rate debt and for new debt this increased cost could make the financing of any acquisition and development activity more costly rising interest rates could limit our ability to refinance existing debt when it matures or cause us to pay higher interest rates upon refinancing and increase interest expense on refinanced indebtedness in addition an increase in interest rates could decrease the amount third parties are willing to pay for our assets thereby limiting our ability to reposition our portfolio promptly in response to changes in economic or other conditions 

we manage a portion of our exposure to interest rate risk by accessing debt with staggered maturities and through the use of derivative instruments primarily interest rate swap agreements however no amount of hedging activity can fully insulate us from the risks associated with changes in interest rates swap agreements involve risk including that counterparties may fail to honor their obligations under these arrangements that these arrangements may not be effective in reducing our exposure to interest rate changes that the amount of income we earn from hedging transactions may be limited by federal tax provisions governing reits and that these arrangements may cause us to pay higher interest rates on our debt obligations than would otherwise be the case failure to hedge effectively against interest rate risk if we choose to engage in such activities could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition  

covenants in our debt instruments limit our operational flexibility and breaches of these covenants could materially adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition  

the terms of our current secured and unsecured debt instruments and other indebtedness that we may incur in the future require or will require us to comply with a number of customary financial and other covenants such as maintaining leverage ratios minimum tangible net worth requirements reit status and certain levels of debt service coverage our continued ability to incur additional debt and to conduct business in general is subject to compliance with these financial and other covenants which limit our operational flexibility for example mortgages on our properties contain customary covenants such as those that limit or restrict our ability without the consent of the lender to further encumber or sell the applicable properties or to replace the applicable tenant or operator breaches of certain covenants may result in defaults under the mortgages on our properties and crossdefaults under certain of our other indebtedness even if we satisfy our payment obligations to the respective obligee covenants that limit our operational flexibility as well as defaults resulting from the breach of any of these covenants could materially adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition  

volatility disruption or uncertainty in the financial markets may impair our ability to raise capital obtain new financing or refinance existing obligations and fund real estate and development activities  

the global financial markets have experienced periods of significant volatility disruption and uncertainty while these conditions have stabilized since the first quarter of 2009 and the capital markets continue to show signs of improvement the strength and sustainability of an economic recovery is uncertain increased or prolonged market disruption volatility or uncertainty could materially adversely impact our ability to raise capital obtain new financing or refinance our existing obligations as they mature and fund real estate and development activities 

market volatility could also lead to significant uncertainty in the valuation of our investments and those of our joint ventures which may result in a substantial decrease in the value of our properties and those of our joint ventures as a result we may be unable to recover the carrying amount of such investments and the associated goodwill if any which may require us to recognize impairment charges in earnings  

 

we may be adversely affected by fluctuations in currency exchange rates  

we continue to pursue growth opportunities in international markets where the us dollar is not the denominated currency the ownership of investments located outside of the united states subjects us to risk from fluctuations in exchange rates between foreign currencies and the us dollar a significant change in the value of the british pound sterling “gbp” or other currencies in countries where we have a significant investment may have a materially adverse effect on our financial position debt covenant ratios results of operations and cash flow 

we may attempt to manage the impact of foreign currency exchange rate changes through the use of derivative contracts or other methods for example we currently utilize gbp denominated liabilities as a natural hedge against our gbp denominated assets additionally we executed currency swap contracts to hedge the risk related to a portion of the forecasted interest receipts on these investments however no amount of hedging activity can fully insulate us from the risks associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates and the failure to hedge effectively against foreign currency exchange rate risk if we choose to engage in such activities could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition in addition any international currency gain recognized with respect to changes in exchange rates may not qualify under the 75 gross income test or the 95 gross income test that we must satisfy annually in order to qualify and maintain our status as a reit  

  

  

risks related to other events 

we are subject to certain provisions of maryland law and our charter relating to business combinations which may prevent a transaction that may otherwise be in the interest of our stockholders  

the maryland business combination act provides that unless exempted a maryland corporation may not engage in business combinations including a merger consolidation share exchange or in circumstances specified in the statute an asset transfer or issuance or reclassification of equity securities with an “interested stockholder” or an affiliate of an interested stockholder for five years after the most recent date on which the interested stockholder became an interested stockholder and thereafter unless specified criteria are met an interested stockholder is generally a person owning or controlling directly or indirectly 10 or more of the voting power of the outstanding voting stock of a maryland corporation unless our board of directors takes action to exempt us generally or with respect to certain transactions from this statute in the future the maryland business combination act will be applicable to business combinations between us and other persons 

in addition to the restrictions on business combinations contained in the maryland business combination act our charter also contains restrictions on business combinations our charter requires that except in certain circumstances “business combinations” including a merger or consolidation and certain asset transfers and issuances of securities with a “related person” including a beneficial owner of 10 or more of our outstanding voting stock be approved by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 90 of our outstanding voting stock 

the restrictions on business combinations provided under maryland law and contained in our charter may delay defer or prevent a change of control or other transaction even if such transaction involves a premium price for our common stock or our stockholders believe that such transaction is otherwise in their best interests  

unfavorable resolution of litigation matters and disputes could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  

from time to time we are involved in legal proceedings lawsuits and other claims we may also be named as defendants in lawsuits arising out of our alleged actions or the alleged actions of our tenants and operators for which such tenants and operators have agreed to indemnify defend and hold us harmless an unfavorable resolution of any such litigation may have a materially adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition regardless of the outcome litigation or other legal proceedings may result in substantial costs disruption of our normal business operations and the diversion of management attention we may be unable to prevail in or achieve a favorable settlement of any pending or future legal action against us  

 

loss of our key personnel could temporarily disrupt our operations and adversely affect us  

we are dependent on the efforts of our executive officers and competition for these individuals is intense although our chief executive officer chief financial officer and chief investment officer have employment agreements with us we cannot assure you that they will remain employed with us the loss or limited availability of the services of any of our executive officers or our inability to recruit and retain qualified personnel in the future could at least temporarily have a materially adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition and the value of our common stock  

we may experience uninsured or underinsured losses which could result in a significant loss of the capital invested in a property lower than expected future revenues or unanticipated expense  

we maintain comprehensive insurance coverage on our properties with terms conditions limits and deductibles that we believe are adequate and appropriate given the relative risk and costs of such coverage and we regularly review our insurance coverage however a large number of our properties are located in areas exposed to earthquake windstorm flood and other natural disasters and may be subject to other losses in particular our life science portfolio is concentrated in areas known to be subject to earthquake activity while we purchase insurance coverage for earthquake windstorm flood and other natural disasters that we believe is adequate in light of current industry practice and analyses prepared by outside consultants such insurance may not fully cover such losses these losses can result in decreased anticipated revenues from a property and the loss of all or a portion of the capital we have invested in a property following these events we may remain liable for any mortgage debt or other financial obligations related to the property the insurance market for such exposures can be very volatile and we may be unable to purchase the limits and terms we desire on a commercially reasonable basis in the future in addition there are certain exposures for which we do not purchase insurance because we do not believe it is economically feasible to do so or where there is no viable insurance market  

environmental compliance costs and liabilities associated with our real estaterelated investments may be substantial and may materially impair the value of those investments  

federal state and local laws ordinances and regulations may require us as a current or previous owner of real estate to investigate and clean up certain hazardous or toxic substances or petroleum released at a property we may be held liable to a governmental entity or to third parties for property damage and for investigation and cleanup costs incurred by the third parties in connection with the contamination the costs of cleanup and remediation could be substantial in addition some environmental laws create a lien on the contaminated site in favor of the government for damages and the costs it incurs in connection with the contamination 

although we currently carry environmental insurance on our properties in an amount that we believe is commercially reasonable and generally require our tenants and operators to indemnify us for environmental liabilities they cause such liabilities could exceed the amount of our insurance the financial ability of the tenant or operator to indemnify us or the value of the contaminated property as the owner of a site we may also be held liable to third parties for damages and injuries resulting from environmental contamination emanating from the site including the release of asbestoscontaining materials into the air we may also experience environmental liabilities arising from conditions not known to us the cost of defending against these claims complying with environmental regulatory requirements conducting remediation of any contaminated property or paying personal injury or other claims or fines could be substantial and could have a materially adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

in addition the presence of contamination or the failure to remediate contamination may materially adversely affect our ability to use sell or lease the property or to borrow using the property as collateral  

we rely on information technology in our operations and any material failure inadequacy interruption or security failure of that technology could harm our business  

we rely on information technology networks and systems including the internet to process transmit and store electronic information and to manage or support a variety of business processes including financial transactions and records and maintaining personal identifying information and tenant and lease data we purchase some of our information technology from vendors on whom our systems depend we rely on commercially available systems software tools and monitoring to provide security for the processing transmission and storage of confidential tenant and customer data including individually identifiable information relating to financial accounts although we have taken steps to protect the security of 

 

our information systems and the data maintained in those systems it is possible that our safety and security measures will not prevent the systems’ improper functioning or damage or the improper access or disclosure of personally identifiable information such as in the event of cyberattacks security breaches including physical or electronic breakins computer viruses attacks by hackers and similar breaches can create system disruptions shutdowns or unauthorized disclosure of confidential information the risk of security breaches has generally increased as the number intensity and sophistication of attacks have increased in some cases it may be difficult to anticipate or immediately detect such incidents and the damage they cause any failure to maintain proper function security and availability of our information systems could interrupt our operations damage our reputation subject us to liability claims or regulatory penalties and could have a materially adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations  

  

risk related to tax including reitrelated risks 

loss of our tax status as a reit would substantially reduce our available funds and would have materially adverse consequences for us and the value of our common stock  

qualification as a reit involves the application of numerous highly technical and complex provisions of the internal revenue code of 1986 as amended the “code” for which there are only limited judicial and administrative interpretations as well as the determination of various factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control we intend to continue to operate in a manner that enables us to qualify as a reit however our qualification and taxation as a reit depend upon our ability to meet through actual annual operating results asset diversification distribution levels and diversity of stock ownership the various qualification tests imposed under the code for example to qualify as a reit at least 95 of our gross income in any year must be derived from qualifying sources and we must make distributions to our stockholders aggregating annually at least 90 of our reit taxable income excluding net capital gains in addition new legislation regulations administrative interpretations or court decisions could change the tax laws or interpretations of the tax laws regarding qualification as a reit or the federal income tax consequences of that qualification in a manner that is materially adverse to our stockholders accordingly there is no assurance that we have operated or will continue to operate in a manner so as to qualify or remain qualified as a reit 

if we lose our reit status we will face serious tax consequences that will substantially reduce the funds available to make payments of principal and interest on the debt securities we issue and to make distributions to stockholders if we fail to qualify as a reit  









as a result of all these factors our failure to qualify as a reit could also impair our ability to expand our business and raise capital and could materially adversely affect the value of our common stock 

the present federal income tax treatment of reits may be modified possibly with retroactive effect by legislative judicial or administrative action at any time which could affect the federal income tax treatment of an investment in us the federal income tax rules dealing with reits constantly are under review by persons involved in the legislative process the us internal revenue service the “irs” and the us treasury department which results in statutory changes as well as frequent revisions to regulations and interpretations revisions in federal tax laws and interpretations thereof could affect or cause us to change our investments and commitments and affect the tax considerations of an investment in us  

we could have potential deferred and contingent tax liabilities from corporate acquisitions that could limit delay or impede future sales of our properties  

if during the five year period beginning on the date we acquire certain companies we recognize a gain on the disposition of any property acquired then to the extent of the excess of i the fair market value of such property as of the acquisition 

 

date over ii our adjusted income tax basis in such property as of that date we will be required to pay a corporatelevel federal income tax on this gain at the highest regular corporate rate there can be no assurance that these triggering dispositions will not occur and these requirements could limit delay or impede future sales of our properties 

in addition the irs may assert liabilities against us for corporate income taxes for taxable years prior to the time that we acquire certain companies in which case we will owe these taxes plus interest and penalties if any  

there are uncertainties relating to the calculation of nonreit tax earnings and profits “ep” in certain acquisitions which may require us to distribute ep  

in order to remain qualified as a reit we are required to distribute to our stockholders all of the accumulated nonreit ep of certain companies that we acquire prior to the close of the first taxable year in which the acquisition occurs failure to make such ep distributions would result in our disqualification as a reit the determination of the amount to be distributed in such ep distributions is a complex factual and legal determination we may have less than complete information at the time we undertake our analysis or we may interpret the applicable law differently from the irs we currently believe that we have satisfied the requirements relating to such ep distributions there are however substantial uncertainties relating to the determination of ep including the possibility that the irs could successfully assert that the taxable income of the companies acquired should be increased which would increase our nonreit ep moreover an audit of the acquired company following our acquisition could result in an increase in accumulated nonreit ep which could require us to pay an additional taxable distribution to our thenexisting stockholders if we qualify under rules for curing this type of default or could result in our disqualification as a reit 

thus we might fail to satisfy the requirement that we distribute all of our nonreit ep by the close of the first taxable year in which the acquisition occurs moreover although there are procedures available to cure a failure to distribute all of our ep we cannot now determine whether we will be able to take advantage of these procedures or the economic impact on us of doing so  

the lease of “qualified healthcare properties” to a taxable reit subsidiary or trs is subject to special requirements  

we may lease certain “qualified healthcare properties” to a trs which in turn contracts with a manager or related party to operate the property the rents from this trs lessee structure are treated as qualifying rents from real property if i they are paid pursuant to an armslength lease of a “qualified healthcare property” with the trs and ii the manager qualifies as an “eligible independent contractor” as defined in the code if either of these conditions is not satisfied then the rents will not be qualifying rents  

recent tax legislation impacts certain us federal income tax rules applicable to reits and could adversely affect our current tax positions  

the recently enacted protecting americans from tax hikes act of 2015 the “act” contains changes to certain aspects of the us federal income tax rules applicable to us the act is the most recent example of changes to the reit rules and additional legislative changes may occur that could adversely affect our current tax positions the act modifies various rules that apply to our ownership of and business relationship with our trss and reduces the maximum allowable value of our assets attributable to trss from 25 to 20 which could impact our ability to enter into future investments the act makes permanent the reduction of the recognition period from ten years to five years during which an entity that converted from a corporation to a reit or was acquired by a reit is subject to a corporatelevel tax on builtin gains recognized during such period which could influence the types of investments we enter into in the future the act also makes multiple changes related to the foreign investment in real property tax act or firpta expands prohibited transaction safe harbors and qualifying hedges and repeals the preferential dividend rule for public reits previously applicable to us lastly the act adjusts the way we may calculate certain earnings and profits calculations to avoid double taxation at the stockholder level and expands the types of qualifying assets and income for purposes of the reit requirements the provisions enacted by the act could result in changes in our tax positions or investments and future legislative changes related to those rules described above could have a materially adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition  

 

our international expansion may result in additional taxrelated risks  

we have expanded our operations to include the united kingdom and may continue to expand internationally international expansion presents taxrelated risks that are different from those we face with respect to our domestic properties and operations these risks include but are not limited to  







our charter contains ownership limits with respect to our common stock and other classes of capital stock  

our charter contains restrictions on the ownership and transfer of our common stock and preferred stock that are intended to assist us in preserving our qualification as a reit under our charter subject to certain exceptions no person or entity may own actually or constructively more than 98 by value or by number of shares whichever is more restrictive of the outstanding shares of our common stock or any class or series of our preferred stock 

additionally our charter has a 99 ownership limitation on the direct or indirect ownership of our voting shares which may include common stock or other classes of capital stock our board of directors in its sole discretion may exempt a proposed transferee from either ownership limit the ownership limits may delay defer or prevent a transaction or a change of control that might involve a premium price for our common stock or might otherwise be in the best interests of our stockholders

the postacuteskilled nursing “snf” industry and hcrmc continued to experience a challenging operating environment in 2015 due to the ongoing change in reimbursement models which reduces rates and lowers census the result of shorter lengths of stay hcrmc’s normalized f ixed c harge c overage for the 12month period end ed december   31 2015 was 107x  

for the fourth quarter 2015 hcrmc reported normalized ebitdar of 110 million which decreased 36 million on a yearoveryear basis compared to the fourth quarter 2014 and decreased 17 million sequentially compared to the third quarter 2015 the results were impacted by core operating performance weakness and unfavorable nonroutine items discussed below the level of performance was below expectations and uncharacteristic for the fourth quarter which has historically been strong due in large part to increased census and the annual medicare rate increases on october 1 

hcrmc ended 2015 with 125 million of cash and cash equivalents and continues to be current on its obligations under the amended master lease the “amended master lease” 

 

core operating performance  before the impact from nonroutine items described below hcrmc’s fourth quarter ebitdar was below its forecast primarily due to the continued change in payor mix from traditional medicare to managed care plans which reduced reimbursement rates and lowered census as a result hcrmc reported a decline in its core snf operating metrics which excludes the 50 nonstrategic disposition assets with fourth quarter census decreasing 175 basis points from the prior year to 826  

nonroutine items  as discussed below  hcrmc is in the process of exiting 50 nonstrategic assets of which 21 sales were completed in the fourth quarter and an additional 11 closed in the first quarter 2016 as such disruption resulting from transitioning operations to new owners and closing costs led to additional underperformance from this pool of assets ebitdar losses from the sale of nonstrategic assets totaled 11 million in the fourth quarter 2015 and 22 million for full year 2015 hcp continues to expect total proceeds of 350 million from the sales of the nonstrategic assets of which 280 million have closed todate with the remaining 70 million expected to close in mid2016  

in addition hcrmc continues to defend against the doj civil complaint previously disclosed in april 2015 hcrmc incurred legal and regulatory defense costs of 3 million during the fourth quarter 2015 and 9 million for the full year 2015 the outcome of the doj civil complaint remains uncertain and hcrmc expects to incur additional legal and regulatory defense costs in 2016  

as a result of hcrmc’s fourth quarter performance deterioration and the related decline in its fcc we placed our real estate portfolio operated by hcrmc on “watch list” status at year end 2015 and changed our accounting treatment to recognize rental income on a cash basis beginning january 2016 as such we will no longer recognize noncash accretion income under the hcrmc dfls see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements   

the reduced growth outlook for the broader postacutesnf industry indicates challenges to the improvement in hcrmc’s financial performance over the next few years at year end 2015 the company determined that it is probable that its hcrmc dfl investments are impaired and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated in the fourth quarte r 2015 the company recorded an allowance impairment charge for dfl losses of 817 million reducing the carrying amount of its hcrmc dfl investments from 60 billion to 52 billion see notes 6 and 17 to the consolidated financial statements we also recorded a fourth quarter 2015 impairment charge of 19 million related to our equity investment in hcrmc opco see note 8 to the consolidated financial statements   

hcp has engaged advisors and continues to work closely with hcrmc to jointly explore all opportunities that reduce our concentration improve the credit quality and coverage of our amended master lease and ensure hcrmc can continue to deliver high quality care and services  

hcrmc third quarter 2015 

in october 2015 we concluded that our equity investment in hcrmc was otherthantemporarily impaired as of september 30 2015 and we recorded an impairment charge of 27 million during the third quarter of 2015 the impairment charge reduced the carrying amount of our equity investment in hcrmc to 21 million our impairment determination primarily resulted from our review of hcrmc operating results and market and industry data which among other factors showed a declining trend in admissions from hospitals and continuing trends in mix and length of stay driven by medicare advantage and other manage care plans  

hcrmc first quarter 2015 

during the quarter ended march 31 2015 hcp and hcrmc agreed to market for sale the real estate and operations associated with 50 nonstrategic facilities that were under the master lease and security agreement the “master lease” for an estimated total gross sales price of approximately 350 million hcrmc receives annual rent reduction under the master lease based on 775 of the net sales proceeds received by hcp during the year ended december 3 1 2015 we completed sales of 22 nonstrategic hcrmc facilities for  21 9 mill ion through february 8 2016 3 3 of the facility sales have closed and the remaining facility sales are expected to close mid 2016  

additionally hcp and hcrmc agreed to amend the master lease the “hcrmc lease amendment” commencing april 1 2015 hcp provided an annual net rent reduction of 68 million which equates to initial lease year rent of 473   million compared to 541 million that would have commenced april 1 2015 prior to the hcrmc lease 

 

amendment the contractual rent will increase by 30 annually during the initial term in exchange hcp receive d the following consideration 







  

in march 2015 we recorded a noncash impairment charge of 478 million related to our hcrmc dfl investments the noncash charge reduced the carrying value of the hcrmc dfl investments from 66 billion to 61   billion which represented the present value of the future lease payments under the amended master lease  the impairment determination resulted from discussions with hcrmc in which they expressed an increasing desire to reduce rent in consideration of potential economic trades to hcp prior to the april 1 2015 rental increase of 35 under the master lease without regard to the hcrmc lease amendment 

  

see note 6 to the consolidated financial statements for additional discussion o f the hcrmc lease amendment and impairment of our hcrmc dfl investment s  note 8 to the consolidated financial statements for additional discussion regarding our equity interest in hcrmc and the doj complaint against hcrmc and note 17 to the consolidated financial statements for additional discussion regarding the impairments  which information is incorporated by reference herein

results of operations

nongaap financial measures   

net operating income “noi” 

noi and adjusted noi are nongaap supplemental financial measures used to evaluate the operating performance of real estate noi is defined as rental and related revenues including tenant recoveries resident fees and services and income from dfls less property level operating expenses noi excludes all other financial statement amounts included in net income loss as presented in note 14 to the consolidated financial statements management believes noi provides relevant and useful information because it reflects only income and operating expense items that are incurred at the property level and presents them on an unleveraged basis adjusted noi is calculated as noi after eliminating the effects of straightline rents dfl accretion amortization of market lease intangibles and lease termination fees adjusted noi is oftentimes referred to as “cash noi” we use noi and adjusted noi to make decisions about resource allocations assess and compare property level performance and evaluate our same property portfolio “spp”  as described below  we believe that net income loss is the most directly comparable us generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” measure to noi noi should not be viewed as an alternative measure of operating performance to net income loss as defined by gaap since it does not reflect various excluded items further our definition of noi may not be comparable to the definition used by other reits or real estate companies as they may use different methodologies for calculating noi noi and adjusted noi are nongaap supplemental financial measures for a reconciliation of net income loss to noi and adjusted noi and other relevant disclosure refer to note   14 to the consolidated financial statements 

operating expenses generally relate to leased medical office and life science properties and senior housing ridea properties we generally recover all or a portion of our leased medical office and life science property expenses through tenant recoveries we present expenses as operating or general and administrative based on the underlying nature of the expense periodically we review the classification of expenses between categories and make revisions based on changes in the underlying nature of the expenses 

same property portfolio “spp” 

spp noi and adjusted noi information allows us to evaluate the performance of our property portfolio under a consistent population by eliminating changes in the composition of our portfolio of properties we identify our spp as stabilized properties that remained in operations and were consistently reported as leased properties or ridea properties for the duration of the year  over  year comparison periods presented excluding assets held for sale accordingly it takes a stabilized property a minimum of 12 months in operations under a consistent reporting structure to be included in our spp newly acquired operating assets are generally considered stabilized at the earlier of lease up typically when the tenants controls the physical use of at least 80 of the space or 12 months from the acquisition date newly completed developments and redevelopments are considered stabilized at the earlier of lease up or 24 months from the date the 

 

property is placed in service spp noi excludes certain nonproperty specific operating expenses that are allocated to each operating segment on a consolidated basis spp adjusted noi excludes the effects of foreign exchange rate movements by using the average current period exchange rate to translate from gbp into usd for the comparison periods a property is removed from our spp when it is sold placed into redevelopment or changes its reporting structure 

funds from operations   

we believe ffo applicable to common shares diluted ffo applicable to common shares and diluted ffo per common share are important supplemental nongaap measures of operating performance for a reit because the historical cost accounting convention used for real estate assets utilizes straightline depreciation except on land such accounting presentation implies that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time since real estate values instead have historically risen and fallen with market conditions presentations of operating results for a reit that use historical cost accounting for depreciation could be less informative the term ffo was designed by the reit industry to address this issue 

ffo  as defined by the nareit is net income loss applicable to common shares computed in accordance with gaap excluding gains or losses from sales of property impairments of or related to depreciable real estate plus real estate and other depreciation and amortization and after adjustments for joint ventures adjustments for joint ventures are calculated to reflect ffo on the same basis ffo does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with gaap is not necessarily indicative of cash available to fund cash needs and should not be considered an alternative to net income loss we compute ffo in accordance with the current nareit definition however other reits may report ffo differently or have a different interpretation of the current nareit definition from ours   

in addition we present ffo before the impact of severancerelated charges litigation settlement charges preferred stock redemption charges impairments recoveries of nondepreciable assets foreign currency remeasurement losses gains and transactionrelated items defined below “ffo as adjusted” transactionrelated items include acquisition and pursuit costs eg due diligence and closing and gainscharges incurred as a result of mergers and acquisitions and lease amendment or termination activities management believes that ffo as adjusted provides a meaningful supplemental measurement of our ffo runrate this measure is a modification of the nareit definition of ffo and should not be used as an alternative to net income loss determined in accordance with gaap or nareit ffo ffo and ffo as adjusted are nongaap supplemental financial measures for a reconciliation of net income loss to ffo and ffo as adjusted and other relevant disclosure refer to “nongaap financial measures reconciliations” below  

funds available for distribution 

fad is defined as ffo as adjusted after excluding the impact of the following i amortization of acquired market lease intangibles net ii amortization of deferred compensation expense iii amortization of deferred financing costs net iv straightline rents v accretion and depreciation related to dfls and lease incentive amortization reduction of straightline rents and vi deferred revenues excluding amounts amortized into rental income that are associated with tenant funded improvements ownedrecognized by us and upfront cash payments made by tenants to reduce their contractual rents also fad i is computed after deducting recurring capital expenditures including leasing costs and second generation tenant and capital improvements and ii includes lease restructure payments and adjustments to compute our share of fad from our unconsolidated joint ventures and those related to ccrc nonrefundable entrance fees other reits or real estate companies may use different methodologies for calculating fad and accordingly our fad may not be comparable to those reported by other reits although our fad computation may not be comparable to that of other reits management believes fad provides a meaningful supplemental measure of our performance and is frequently used by analysts investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of our performance as a reit fad does not represent cash generated from operating activities determined in accordance with gaap is not necessarily indicative of cash available to fund cash needs and should not be considered as an alternative to net income loss determined in accordance with gaap fad is a nongaap supplemental financial measure for a reconciliation of net income loss to fad as defined and other relevant disclosure refer to “nongaap financial measures reconciliations” below

our principal investing liquidity needs for the next 12 months are to 





we anticipate satisfying these future investing needs using one or more of the following 









access to capital markets impacts our cost of capital and ability to refinance maturing indebtedness as well as our ability to fund future acquisitions and development through the issuance of additional securities or secured debt credit ratings impact our ability to access capital and directly impact our cost of capital as well for example as noted below our revolving line of credit facility accrues interest at a rate per annum equal to libor plus a margin that depends upon our credit ratings we also pay a facility fee on the entire revolving commitment that depends upon our credit ratings  as of january 29  201 6  we had a credit rating of bbb from fitch baa1 from moody’s and bbb from sp on our senior unsecured debt securities 

 

  

cash flow summary 

the following summary discussion of our cash flows is based on the consolidated statements of cash flows and is not meant to be an allinclusive discussion of the changes in our cash flows for the periods presented below

the in crease in operating cash flow is the result of a net paydown of working capital our cash flow from operations is dependent upon the occupancy levels of our buildings rental rates on leases our tenants’ performance on their lease obligations the level of operating expenses and other factors  

the following are significant investing and financing activities for the year ended december 31 2015  







debt 

bank line of credit and term loans our 20 billion unsecured revolving line of credit facility the “facility” matures on march 31 2018 and contains a oneyear extension option borrowings under the facility accrue interest at libor plus a margin that depends upon our credit ratings we pay a facility fee on the entire revolving commitment that depends on our credit ratings based on our credit ratings at january   29  201 6  the margin on the facility was 0925 and the facility fee was 015 the facility also includes a feature that will allow us to increase the borrowing capacity by an aggregate amount of up to 500 million subject to securing additional commitments from existing lenders or new lending institutions at december 3 1  2015 we had  397   m illion  £ 270 million outstanding under the facility with a weighted average effective interest rate of 1 7 2  

on july 30 2012 we entered into a credit agreement with a syndicate of banks for a £137 million 2 02 million at december 31 2015  fouryear unsecured term loan the “2012 term loan” based on our credit ratings at january 29  201 6  the 2012 term loan accrues interest at a rate of gbp libor plus 120 concurrent with the closing of the 2012 term loan we entered into a fouryear interest rate swap contract that fixes the rate of the 2012 term loan at 181 subject to adjustments based on our credit ratings the 2012 term loan contains a oneyear committed extension option 

on january 12 2015 we entered into a credit agreement with a syndicate of banks for a £220 million  32 3 million at december 3 1  2015 fouryear unsecured term loan the “2015 term loan” that accrues interest at a rate of gbp libor plus 0975 subject to adjustments based on our credit ratings the 2012 and 2015 term loans are collectively the “term loans”  proceeds from this term loan were used to repay a £220 million draw on the facility that partially funded the november 2014 hcone facility see note 7 to the consolidated financial statements concurrently we entered into a threeyear interest rate swap agreement that effectively fixes the interest rate of the 2015 term loan at 179 see note 2 4 to the consolidated financial statements the 2015 term loan contains a oneyear committed extension option  

 

the facility and term loans contain certain financial restrictions and other customary requirements among other things these covenants using terms defined in the agreements i limit the ratio of consolidated total indebtedness to consolidated total asset value to 60 ii limit the ratio of secured debt to consolidated total asset value to 30 iii limit the ratio of unsecured debt to consolidated unencumbered asset value to 60 and iv require a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio of 15 times the facility and term loans also require a minimum consolidated tangible net worth of 95 billion at december 31 2015  at december 31 2015  we were in compliance with each of these restrictions and requirements of the facility and term loan s  

senior unsecured notes at december 31 2015  we had senior unsecured notes outstanding with an aggregate principal balance of  92 billion interest rates on the notes ranged from 279 to 6 88  with a weighted average effective interest rate of 4 68  and a weighted average maturity of six years at december 31 2015  the senior unsecured notes contain certain covenants including limitations on debt maintenance of unencumbered assets crossacceleration provisions and other customary terms at december 31 2015  we believe we were in compliance with these covenants 

mortgage debt at december 31 2015  we had  9 3 3   m illion in aggregate principal amount of mortgage debt outstanding that is secured by 62 healthcare facilities including redevelopment properties with a carrying value of 1 2 billion interest rates on the mortgage debt ranged from 314  to 8 35  with a weighted average effective interest rate of 6 2 1 and a weighted average maturity of two years at december 31 2015  

mortgage debt generally requires monthly principal and interest payments is collateralized by real estate assets and is generally nonrecourse mortgage debt typically restricts transfer of the encumbered assets prohibits additional liens restricts prepayment requires payment of real estate taxes requires maintenance of the assets in good condition requires maintenance of insurance on the assets and includes conditions to obtain lender consent to enter into and terminate material leases some of the mortgage debt is also crosscollateralized by multiple assets and may require tenants or operators to maintain compliance with the applicable leases or operating agreements of such real estate assets 

equity 

at december 31 2015  we had 46 5 million shares of common stock outstanding equity totaled  97 billion and our equity securities had a market value of  18 0 billion 

at   december 31 2015  nonmanaging members held an aggregate of four million units in five limited liability companies “downreits” for which we are the managing member  the downreit units are exchangeable for an amount of cash approximating the thencurrent market value of shares of our common stock or at our option shares of our common stock subject to certain adjustments such as stock splits and reclassifications 

atthemarket program  in june 2015 we established an atm program in connection with the renewal of our shelf registration statement under this program we may sell shares of our common stock from time to time having an aggregate gross sales price of up to 750 million through a consortium of banks acting as sales agents or directly to the banks acting as principals during the year ended december 3 1  2015 we issued 1 8 million shares of common stock at a weighted average price of 40 14 for proceeds of  73 million net of fees and commissions of 1 million actual future sales will depend upon a variety of factors including but not limited to market conditions the trading price of our common stock and our capital needs we have no obligation to sell the remaining shares available for sale under our program  

shelf registration 

we filed a prospectus with the sec as part of a registration statement on form s3asr using a shelf registration process which expires in june 2018 under the “shelf” process we may sell any combination of the securities described in the prospectus through one or more offerings the securities described in the prospectus include common stock preferred stock depositary shares debt securities and warrants  

 

  

capital market outlook 

the capital markets have facilitated our continued growth including our international expansion for the 2 4 months ended december 3 1  2015 we have raised  31 billion in senior unsecured notes originated a £220 million 333   million fouryear unsecured term loan and increased our facility from 15 billion to 20 billion the capital raised in combination with available cash and borrowing capacity under our facility supported  42 billion of investments completed during the 24 months ended december 31 201 5  we believe our equity and debt investors as well as our banking relationships will provide additional capital as we pursue new investment opportunities  

contractual obligations 

the following table summarizes our material contractual payment obligations and commitments at december 31 2015 in thousands 



















offbalance sheet arrangements 

we own interests in certain unconsolidated joint ventures as described under note 8 to the consolidated financial statements except in limited circumstances our risk of loss is limited to our investment in the joint venture and any outstanding loans receivable in addition we have certain properties which serve as collateral for debt that is owed by a previous owner of certain of our facilities as described under note 12 to the consolidated financial statements our risk of loss for these certain properties is limited to the outstanding debt balance plus penalties if any we have no other material offbalance sheet arrangements that we expect would materially affect our liquidity and capital resources except those described above under “ contractual obligations ”  

inflation 

our leases often provide for either fixed increases in base rents or indexed escalators based on the consumer price index or other measures andor additional rent based on increases in the tenants’ operating revenues most of our mob leases require the tenant to pay a share of property operating costs such as real estate taxes insurance and utilities substantially all of our senior housing life science postacuteskilled nursing and hospital leases require the tenant or operator to pay all of the property operating costs or reimburse us for all such costs we believe that inflationary increases in expenses will be offset in part by the tenant or operator expense reimbursements and contractual rent increases described above

critical accounting policies 

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us gaap requires our management to use judgment in the application of accounting policies including making estimates and assumptions we base estimates on the best information available to us at the time our experience and on various other assumptions believed to be reasonable under the circumstances these estimates affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods if our judgment or interpretation of the facts and circumstances relating to various transactions or other matters had been different it is possible that different accounting would have been applied resulting in a different presentation of our consolidated financial statements from time to time we reevaluate our estimates and assumptions in the event estimates or assumptions prove to be different from actual results adjustments are made in subsequent periods to reflect more current estimates and assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain for a more detailed discussion of our significant accounting policies see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements below is a discussion of accounting policies that we consider critical in that they may require complex judgment in their application or require estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain 

  

principles of consolidation 

the consolidated financial statements include the accounts of hcp inc our wholly owned subsidiaries and joint ventures that we control through voting rights or other means we consolidate investments in variable interest entities “vies” when we are the primary beneficiary of the vie a variable interest holder is considered to be the primary beneficiary of a vie if it has the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the entity’s economic performance and has the obligation to absorb losses of or the right to receive benefits from the entity that could potentially be significant to the vie  

we make judgments about which entities are vies based on an assessment of whether i the equity investors as a group if any do not have a controlling financial interest ii the equity investment at risk is insufficient to finance that entity’s activities without additional subordinated financial support or iii substantially all of the entity’s activities involve or are performed on behalf of an equity investor that holds disproportionately few voting rights we make judgments with respect to our level of influence or control over an entity and whether we are or are not the primary beneficiary of a vie consideration of various factors includes but is not limited to our ability to direct the activities that most significantly impact the entity’s economic performance our form of ownership interest our representation on the entity’s governing body the size and seniority of our investment and our ability and the rights of other investors to participate in policy making decisions replace the manager andor liquidate the entity if applicable our ability to correctly assess our influence or control over an entity when determining the primary beneficiary of a vie affects the presentation of these entities in our consolidated financial statements when we perform a reanalysis of the primary beneficiary at a date other than at inception of the vie our assumptions may be different and may result in the identification of a different primary beneficiary  

if we determine that we are the primary beneficiary of a vie our consolidated financial statements would include the operating results of the vie rather than the results of the variable interest in the vie we would require the vie to provide us timely financial information and would review the internal controls of the vie to determine if we could rely on the financial information it provides if the vie has deficiencies in its internal controls over financial reporting or does not provide us with timely financial information this may adversely impact the quality andor timing of our financial reporting and our internal controls over financial reporting  

revenue recognition 

at the inception of a new lease arrangement including new leases that arise from amendments we assess the terms and conditions to determine the proper lease classification a lease arrangement is classified as an operating lease if none of the following criteria are met i transfer of ownership to the lessee prior to or shortly after the end of the lease term ii lessee has a bargain purchase option during or at the end of the lease term iii the lease term is equal to 75 or more of the underlying property’s economic life or iv the present value of future minimum lease payments excluding executory costs is equal to 90 or more of the excess estimated fair value over retained tax credits of the leased asset if one of the four criteria is met and the minimum lease payments are determined to be reasonably predictable and collectible the lease arrangement is generally accounted for as a direct financing lease if the assumptions utilized in the above 

 

classifications assessments were different our lease classification for accounting purposes may have been different thus the timing and amount of our revenue recognized would have been impacted which may be material to our consolidated financial statements  

we recognize rental revenue for operating leases on a straightline basis over the lease term when collectibility of all minimum lease payments is reasonably assured and the tenant has taken possession or controls the physical use of a leased asset if the lease provides for tenant improvements we determine whether the tenant improvements are owned by the tenant or us when we are the owner of the tenant improvements the tenant is not considered to have taken physical possession or have control of the leased asset until the tenant improvements are substantially complete when the tenant is the owner of the tenant improvements any tenant improvement allowance funded is treated as a lease incentive and amortized as a reduction of revenue over the lease term the determination of ownership of a tenant improvement is subject to significant judgment if our assessment of the owner of the tenant improvements was different the timing and amount of our revenue recognized would be impacted  

certain leases provide for additional rents that are contingent upon a percentage of the facility’s revenue in excess of specified base amounts or other thresholds such revenue is recognized when actual results reported by the tenant or estimates of tenant results exceed the base amount or other thresholds the recognition of additional rents requires us to make estimates of amounts owed and to a certain extent is dependent on the accuracy of the facility results reported to us our estimates may differ from actual results which could be material to our consolidated financial statements  

we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts including an allowance for operating lease straightline rent receivables for estimated losses resulting from tenant defaults or the inability of tenants to make contractual rent and tenant recovery payments we monitor the liquidity and creditworthiness of our tenants and operators on a continuous basis this evaluation considers industry and economic conditions property performance credit enhancements and other factors for straightline rent receivable amounts our assessment is based on income recoverable over the term of the lease we exercise judgment in establishing allowances and consider payment history and current credit status in developing these estimates these estimates may differ from actual results which could be material to our consolidated financial statements  

we use the direct finance method of accounting to record income from dfls for leases accounted for as dfls the net investment in the dfl represents receivables for the sum of future minimum lease payments receivable and the estimated residual values of the leased properties less the unamortized unearned income unearned income is deferred and amortized to income over the lease terms to provide a constant yield when collectibility of the lease payments is reasonably assured the determination of estimated useful lives and residual values are subject to significant judgment if these assessments were to change the timing and amount of our revenue recognized would be impacted 

loans receivable are classified as heldforinvestment based on management’s intent and ability to hold the loans for the foreseeable future or to maturity we recognize interest income on loans including the amortization of discounts and premiums using the interest method applied on a loanbyloan basis when collectibility of the future payments is reasonably assured premiums discounts and related costs are recognized as yield adjustments over the term of the related loans if management determined that certain loans should no longer be classified as heldforinvestment the timing and amount of our interest income recognized would be impacted 

loans receivable and dfls collectively “finance receivables” are reviewed and assigned an internal rating of performing watch list or workout finance receivables that are deemed performing meet all present contractual obligations and collection and timing of all amounts owed is reasonably assured watch list finance receivables are defined as finance receivables that do not meet the definition of performing or workout workout finance receivables are defined as finance receivables in which the company has determined based on current information and events that it is probable i it will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the agreement ii the tenant operator or borrower is delinquent on making payments under the contractual terms of the agreement iii and the company has commenced action or anticipates pursuing action in the near term to seek recovery of its investment 

 

finance receivables are placed on nonaccrual status when management determines that the collectibility of contractual amounts is not reasonably assured the asset will have an internal rating of either watch list or workout further we perform a credit analysis to support the tenant’s operator’s borrower’s andor guarantor’s repayment capacity and the underlying collateral values we use the cash basis method of accounting for finance receivables placed on nonaccrual status unless one of the following conditions exist whereby we utilize the cost recovery method of accounting i if we determine that it is probable that we will only recover the recorded investment in the finance receivable net of associated allowances or chargeoffs if any or ii we cannot reasonably estimate the amount of an impaired finance receivable for cash basis method of accounting we apply payments received excluding principal paydowns to interest income so long as that amount does not exceed the amount that would have been earned under the original contractual terms for cost recovery method of accounting any payment received is applied to reduce the recorded investment generally we return a finance receivable to accrual status when all delinquent payments become current under the terms of the loan or lease agreements and collectibility of the remaining contractual loan or lease payments is reasonably assured  

allowances are established for finance receivables on an individual basis utilizing an estimate of probable losses if they are determined to be impaired finance receivables are impaired when it is deemed probable that we will be unable to collect all amounts due in accordance with the contractual terms of the loan or lease an allowance is based upon our assessment of the lessee’s or borrower’s overall financial condition economic resources payment record the prospects for support from any financially responsible guarantors and if appropriate the net realizable value of any collateral these estimates consider all available evidence including the expected future cash flows discounted at the finance receivable’s effective interest rate fair value of collateral general economic conditions and trends historical and industry loss experience and other relevant factors as appropriate should a finance receivable be deemed partially or wholly uncollectible the uncollectible balance is charged off against the allowance in the period in which the uncollectible determination has been made 

real estate 

we make estimates as part of our process for allocating a purchase price to the various identifiable assets of an acquisition based upon the relative fair value of each asset the most significant components of our allocations are typically buildings asifvacant land and inplace leases in the case of allocating fair value to buildings and intangibles our fair value estimates will affect the amount of depreciation and amortization we record over the estimated useful life of each asset acquired or the remaining lease term in the case of allocating fair value to inplace leases we make our best estimates based on our evaluation of the specific characteristics of each tenant’s lease factors considered include estimates of carrying costs during hypothetical expected leaseup periods market conditions and costs to execute similar leases our assumptions affect the amount of future revenue that we will recognize over the remaining lease term for the acquired inplace leases  

a variety of costs are incurred in the development and leasing of properties after determination is made to capitalize a cost it is allocated to the specific component of a project that is benefited determination of when a development project is substantially complete and capitalization must cease involves a degree of judgment the costs of land and buildings under development include specifically identifiable costs the capitalized costs include preconstruction costs essential to the development of the property development costs construction costs interest costs real estate taxes and other costs incurred during the period of development we consider a construction project to be considered substantially complete and available for occupancy and cease capitalization of costs upon the completion of the related tenant improvements  

impairment of longlived assets and goodwill 

we assess the carrying value of our real estate assets and related intangibles “real estate assets” when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the real estate assets may not be recoverable but at least annually recoverability of real estate assets is measured by comparing the carrying amount of the real estate assets to the respective estimated future undiscounted cash flows the estimated future undiscounted cash flows are calculated utilizing the lowest level of identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities in order to review our real estate assets for recoverability we consider market conditions as well as our intent with respect to holding or disposing of the asset if our analysis indicates that the carrying value of the real estate assets is not recoverable on an undiscounted cash flow basis we recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the real estate asset  

 

goodwill is tested for impairment at least annually based on certain qualitative factors to determine if it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount potential impairment indicators and qualitative factors include a significant decline in real estate valuations restructuring plans current macroeconomic conditions state of the equity and capital markets or a significant decline in the value of our market capitalization if we determine that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount we apply the required twostep quantitative approach the quantitative procedures of the twostep approach i compare the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount including goodwill and if necessary ii compare the implied fair value of reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill as if it had been acquired in a business combination at the date of the impairment test the excess fair value of the reporting unit over the fair value of assets and liabilities excluding goodwill is the implied value of goodwill and is used to determine the amount of impairment if any we estimate the fair value of the assets and liabilities in the reporting unit through various valuation techniques including applying capitalization rates to segment net operating income quoted market values and thirdparty appraisals as necessary the fair value of the reporting unit may also include an allocation of an enterprise value premium that we estimate a third party would be willing to pay for the company  

the determination of the fair value of real estate assets and goodwill involves significant judgment this judgment is based on our analysis and estimates of fair value of real estate assets and reporting units future operating results and resulting cash flows of each real estate asset whose carrying amount may not be recoverable our ability to accurately predict future operating results resulting cash flows and estimate and allocate fair values impacts the timing and recognition of impairments while we believe our assumptions are reasonable changes in these assumptions may have a material impact on our financial results  

investments in unconsolidated joint ventures 

the initial carrying value of investments in unconsolidated joint ventures is based on the amount paid to purchase the joint venture interest or the carrying value of the assets prior to the sale or contribution of the interests to the joint venture we evaluate our equity method investments for impairment indicators based upon a comparison of the fair value of the equity method investment to our carrying value if we determine there is a decline in the fair value of our investment in an unconsolidated joint venture below its carrying value and it is otherthantemporary an impairment is recorded the determination of the fair value of investments in unconsolidated joint ventures and as to whether a deficiency in fair value is “otherthantemporary” involves significant judgment our estimates consider all available evidence including as appropriate the present value of the expected future cash flows discounted at market rates general economic conditions and trends severity and duration of a fair value deficiency and other relevant factors capitalization rates discount rates and credit spreads utilized in our valuation models are based upon rates that we believe to be within a reasonable range of current market rates for the respective investments while we believe our assumptions are reasonable changes in these assumptions may have a material impact on our financial results  

  

income taxes 

as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements significant management judgment is required to evaluate our compliance with reit requirements our determinations are based on interpretation of tax laws and our conclusions may have an impact on the income tax expense recognized adjustments to income tax expense may be required as a result of i audits conducted by federal state and local tax authorities ii our ability to qualify as a reit iii the potential for builtin gain recognition and iv changes in tax laws adjustments required in any given period are included within the income tax provision

 item 7 a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we are exposed to various market risks including the potential loss arising from adverse changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates specifically the gbp we use derivative financial instruments in the normal course of business to mitigate interest rate and foreign currency risk we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes derivatives are recorded on the consolidated balance sheets at fair value see note 24 to the consolidated financial statements 

 

to illustrate the effect of movements in the interest rate and foreign currency markets we performed a market sensitivity analysis on our hedging instruments we applied various basis point spreads to the underlying interest rate curves and foreign currency exchange rates of the derivative portfolio in order to determine the change in fair value assuming a one percentage point change in the underlying interest rate curve and foreign currency exchange rates the estimated change in fair value of each of the underlying derivative instruments would not exceed  6 million see note 24 to the consolidated financial statements for additional analysis details 

interest rate risk 

at december 31 2015  we are exposed to market risks related to fluctuations in interest rates primarily on variable rate debt which has been predominately hedged through interest rate swap contracts  

interest rate fluctuations will generally not affect our future earnings or cash flows on our fixed rate debt and assets until their maturity or earlier prepayment and refinancing if interest rates have risen at the time we seek to refinance our fixed rate debt whether at maturity or otherwise our future earnings and cash flows could adversely be affected by additional borrowing costs conversely lower interest rates at the time of refinancing may reduce our overall borrowing costs however interest rate changes will affect the fair value of our fixed rate instruments conversely changes in interest rates on variable rate debt and investments would change our future earnings and cash flows but not significantly affect the fair value of those instruments assuming a one percentage point increase in the interest rate related to the variablerate debt and variablerate investments and assuming no other changes in the outstanding balance as of december 31 2015  our annual interest expense would increase by approximately  3 million or less than 00 1 per common share on a diluted basis 

  

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

at december 31 2015  our exposure to foreign currencies primarily relates to uk investments in leased real estate senior notes and related gbp denominated cash flows our foreign currency exposure is partially mitigated through the use of gbp denominated borrowings and foreign currency swap contracts based solely on our operating results for the three months ended december 31 2015 including the impact of existing hedging arrangements if the value of the gbp relative to the us dollar were to increase or decrease by 10 compared to the average exchange rate during the quarter ended december 31 2015 our cash flows would have decreased or increased as applicable by less than 1 million  

market risk 

we have investments in marketable debt securities classified as heldtomaturity because we have the positive intent and ability to hold the securities to maturity heldtomaturity securities are recorded at amortized cost and adjusted for the amortization of premiums and discounts through maturity we consider a variety of factors in evaluating an otherthantemporary decline in value such as the length of time and the extent to which the market value has been less than our current adjusted carrying value the issuer’s financial condition capital strength and nearterm prospects any recent events specific to that issuer and economic conditions of its industry and our investment horizon in relationship to an anticipated nearterm recovery in the market value if any  at december 31 2015  both the fair value and carrying value of marketable debt securities were  103 million 

 

the principal amount and the average interest rates for our loans receivable and debt categorized by maturity dates is presented in the table below the fair value for our senior unsecured notes payable is based on prevailing market prices the fair value estimates for loans receivable and mortgage debt payable are based on discounting future cash flows utilizing current rates for loans and debt of the same type and remaining maturity

business strategy 

we invest and manage our real estate portfolio for the longterm to maximize the benefit to our shareholders and support the growth of our dividends the core elements of our strategy are i to acquire develop lease own and manage a diversified portfolio of quality healthcare properties across multiple business segments and geographic locations including europe ii to align ourselves with leading healthcare companies operators and service providers which over the longterm should result in higher relative rental rates net operating cash flows and appreciation of property values iii to concentrate on longerterm escalating triplenet leases with highquality tenants while using ridea structures for properties that have higher growth potential iv to maintain adequate liquidity with longterm fixed rate debt financing with staggered maturities which supports the longerterm nature of our investments while reducing our exposure to interest rate volatility and refinancing risk at any point in the interest rate or credit cycles and v to continue to manage our balance sheet with a targeted financial leverage of 40 relative to our assets  

internal growth strategies 

we believe that our longerterm escalating triplenet leases with financially strong tenants and operators enhance the quality stability and growth of our rental income further we believe many of our existing properties hold the potential for increased future cash flows as they are of high quality and in desirable locations within markets where the creation of new supply is limited by the lack of available sites and the difficulty of obtaining the necessary licensing other approvals andor financing our strategy for maximizing the benefits from these opportunities is to i work with new or existing tenants and operators to address their space and capital needs and ii provide highquality property management services in order to motivate tenants to renew expand or relocate into our properties 

we expect to continue our internal growth as a result of our ability to  







investment strategies 

the delivery of healthcare services requires real estate and as a result tenants and operators depend on real estate in part to maintain and grow their businesses we believe that the healthcare real estate market provides investment opportunities due to the i compelling demographics driving the demand for healthcare services ii specialized nature of healthcare real estate investing and iii ongoing consolidation of the fragmented healthcare real estate sector  

while we emphasize healthcare real estate ownership we may also provide real estate secured financing to or invest in equity or debt securities of healthcare operators or other entities engaged in healthcare real estate ownership we may also acquire all or substantially all of the securities or assets of other reits operating companies or similar entities where such investments would be consistent with our investment strategies we may coinvest alongside institutional or development investors through partnerships or limited liability companies 

we monitor but do not limit our investments based on the percentage of our total assets that may be invested in any one property type investment vehicle or geographic location the number of properties that may be leased to a single tenant or operator or loans that may be made to a single borrower in allocating capital to our multiple segments we target 

 

opportunities with the most attractive riskreward profile for our portfolio as a whole we may take additional measures to mitigate risk including diversifying our investments by sector geography tenant or operator structuring transactions as master leases requiring tenant or operator insurance and indemnifications and obtaining credit enhancements in the form of guarantees letters of credit or security deposits 

we believe we are well positioned to achieve external growth through acquisitions financing and development other factors that contribute to our competitive position include  

  















financing strategies 

because our reit qualification requires us to distribute at least 90 of our reit taxable income excluding net capital gains we regularly access the public equity and debt markets to raise the funds necessary to finance acquisitions and debt investments develop and redevelop properties and refinance maturing debt    

we may finance acquisitions and other investments through the following vehicles  









we maintain a disciplined balance sheet by actively managing our debt to equity levels and maintaining multiple sources of liquidity such as our revolving line of credit facility access to capital markets and secured debt lenders relationships with current and prospective institutional joint venture partners and our ability to divest of assets our debt obligations are primarily longterm fixed rate with staggered maturities which reduces the impact of rising interest rates on our operations  

we finance our investments based on our evaluation of available sources of funding for shortterm purposes we may utilize our revolving line of credit facility or arrange for other shortterm borrowings from banks or other sources we arrange for longerterm financing by offering equity and debt securities placing mortgage debt and obtaining capital from institutional lenders 

  

 

  

competition 

investing in real estate serving the healthcare industry is highly competitive we face competition from other reits investment companies pension funds private equity and hedge fund investors sovereign funds healthcare operators lenders developers and other institutional investors some of whom may have greater flexibility eg nonreit competitors resources and lower costs of capital than we do increased competition makes it more challenging for us to identify and successfully capitalize on opportunities that meet our objectives our ability to compete may also be impacted by global national and local economic trends availability of investment alternatives availability and cost of capital construction and renovation costs existing laws and regulations new legislation and population trends 

income from our investments is dependent on the ability of our tenants and operators to compete with other companies on a number of different levels including the quality of care provided reputation success of product or drug development the physical appearance of a facility price and range of services offered alternatives for healthcare delivery the supply of competing properties physicians staff referral sources location the size and demographics of the population in surrounding areas and the financial condition of our tenants and operators private federal and state payment programs and government reimbursement as well as the effect of laws and regulations may also have a significant influence on the profitability of our tenants and operators for a discussion of the risks associated with competitive conditions affecting our business see “item 1a risk factors” in this report 

healthcare segments 

senior housing at december 31 2014 we had interests in 479 senior housing facilities including 14 properties owned by our unconsolidated joint ventures our senior housing facilities are primarily triplenet leased and include independent living facilities “ilfs” assisted living facilities “alfs” memory care facilities “mcfs” care homes  and continuing care retirement communities “ccrcs” which cater to different segments of the elderly population based upon their personal needs services provided by our tenants or operators in these facilities are primarily paid for by the residents directly or through private insurance and are less reliant on government reimbursement programs such as medicare and medicaid our senior housing property types are further described below

life science properties are primarily configured in business park or campus settings and include multiple buildings the business park and campus settings allow us the opportunity to provide flexible contiguousadjacent expansion to accommodate the growth of existing tenants our properties are located in well  established geographical markets known for scientific research including san francisco and san diego california salt lake city utah durham north carolina and boston massachusetts at december 31 2014 97 of our life science properties were triple  net leased based on leased square feet

insurance 

we obtain various types of insurance to mitigate the impact of property business interruption liability flood windstorm earthquake environmental and terrorism related losses we attempt to obtain appropriate policy terms conditions limits and deductibles considering the relative risk of loss the cost of such coverage and current industry practice there are however certain types of extraordinary losses such as those due to acts of war or other events that may be either uninsurable or not economically insurable in addition we have a large number of properties that are exposed to earthquake flood and windstorm occurrences for which the related insurances carry higher deductibles 

we maintain property insurance for all of our properties and this insurance is primary for our medical office life science and ridea facilities tenants under triplenet leases primarily in our senior housing postacuteskilled nursing and 

 

hospital segments are required to provide primary property business interruption and liability insurance we maintain separate general and professional liability insurance for our ridea facilities additionally our corporate general and professional liability insurance program also extends coverage for all of our properties beyond the aforementioned under our management agreements with brookdale we may elect on an annual basis whether we or brookdale will bear responsibility for maintaining the required insurance coverage for the applicable properties but the costs of such insurance are facility expenses paid from the revenues of those properties regardless of who maintains the insurance 

employees of hcp 

at december 31 2014 we had 170 fulltime employees none of whom are subject to a collective bargaining agreement 

government regulation licensing and enforcement 

overview 

our tenants and operators are typically subject to extensive and complex federal state and local healthcare laws and regulations relating to quality of care licensure and certificate of need government reimbursement fraud and abuse practices and similar laws governing the operation of healthcare facilities and we expect that the healthcare industry in general will continue to face increased regulation and pressure in the areas of fraud waste and abuse cost control healthcare management and provision of services among others these regulations are wide ranging and can subject our tenants and operators to civil criminal and administrative sanctions affected tenants and operators may find it increasingly difficult to comply with this complex and evolving regulatory environment because of a relative lack of guidance in many areas as certain of our healthcare properties are subject to oversight from several government agencies and the laws may vary from one jurisdiction to another changes in laws regulations reimbursement enforcement activity and regulatory non  compliance by our tenants and operators can all have a significant effect on their operations and financial condition which in turn may adversely impact us as detailed below and set forth under “item 1a risk factors” in this report  

based on information primarily provided by our tenants and operators excluding our medical office segment at december 31 2014 we estimate that approximately 15 and 14 of the annualized base rental payments received from our tenants and operators were dependent on medicare and medicaid reimbursement respectively 

the following is a discussion of certain laws and regulations generally applicable to our operators and in certain cases to us 

fraud and abuse enforcement 

there are various extremely complex federal and state laws and regulations governing healthcare providers’ relationships and arrangements and prohibiting fraudulent and abusive practices by such providers these laws include i federal and state false claims acts which among other things prohibit providers from filing false claims or making false statements to receive payment from medicare medicaid or other federal or state healthcare programs ii federal and state antikickback and feesplitting statutes including the medicare and medicaid antikickback statute which prohibit the payment or receipt of remuneration to induce referrals or recommendations of healthcare items or services iii federal and state physician selfreferral laws commonly referred to as the “stark law” which generally prohibit referrals by physicians to entities with which the physician or an immediate family member has a financial relationship iv the federal civil monetary penalties law which prohibits among other things the knowing presentation of a false or fraudulent claim for certain healthcare services and v federal and state privacy laws including the privacy and security rules contained in the health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 commonly referred to as “hipaa” which provide for the privacy and security of personal health information violations of healthcare fraud and abuse laws carry civil criminal and administrative sanctions including punitive sanctions monetary penalties imprisonment denial of medicare and medicaid reimbursement and potential exclusion from medicare medicaid or other federal or state healthcare programs these laws are enforced by a variety of federal state and local agencies and can also be enforced by private litigants through among other things federal and state false claims acts which allow private litigants to bring qui tam or “whistleblower” actions many of our tenants and operators are subject to these laws and may become the subject of governmental enforcement actions if they fail to comply with applicable laws 

 

reimbursement 

sources of revenue for many of our tenants and operators include among others governmental healthcare programs such as the federal medicare programs and state medicaid programs and nongovernmental thirdparty payors such as insurance carriers and hmos as federal and state governments focus on healthcare reform initiatives and as the federal government and many states face significant current and future budget deficits efforts to reduce costs by these payors will likely continue which may result in reduced or slower growth in reimbursement for certain services provided by some of our tenants and operators additionally new and evolving payor and provider programs including but not limited to medicare advantage dual eligible accountable care organizations “aco” and bundled payments could adversely impact our tenants’ and operators’ liquidity financial condition or results of operations 

healthcare licensure and certificate of need 

certain healthcare facilities in our portfolio are subject to extensive federal state and local licensure certification and inspection laws and regulations in addition various licenses and permits are required to dispense narcotics operate pharmacies handle radioactive materials and operate equipment many states require certain healthcare providers to obtain a certificate of need which requires prior approval for the construction expansion or closure of certain healthcare facilities the approval process related to state certificate of need laws may impact some of our tenants’ and operators’ abilities to expand or change their businesses 

life science facilities 

while certain of our life science tenants include some wellestablished companies other tenants are less established and in some cases may not yet have a product approved by the food and drug administration or other regulatory authorities for commercial sale creating a new pharmaceutical product or medical device requires substantial investments of time and capital in part because of the extensive regulation of the healthcare industry it also entails considerable risk of failure in demonstrating that the product is safe and effective and in gaining regulatory approval and market acceptance

certain of our senior housing facilities are operated as entrance fee communities generally an entrance fee is an upfront fee or consideration paid by a resident a portion of which may be refundable in exchange for some form of longterm benefit some of the entrance fee communities are subject to significant state regulatory oversight including for example oversight of each facility’s financial condition establishment and monitoring of reserve requirements and other financial restrictions the right of residents to cancel their contracts within a specified period of time lien rights in favor of the residents restrictions on change of ownership and similar matters 

americans with disabilities act the “ada” 

our properties must comply with the ada and any similar state or local laws to the extent that such properties are “public accommodations” as defined in those statutes the ada may require removal of barriers to access by persons with disabilities in certain public areas of our properties where such removal is readily achievable to date we have not received any notices of noncompliance with the ada that have caused us to incur substantial capital expenditures to address ada concerns should barriers to access by persons with disabilities be discovered at any of our properties we may be directly or indirectly responsible for additional costs that may be required to make facilities adacompliant noncompliance with the ada could result in the imposition of fines or an award of damages to private litigants the obligation to make readily achievable accommodations pursuant to the ada is an ongoing one and we continue to assess our properties and make modifications as appropriate in this respect 

environmental matters 

a wide variety of federal state and local environmental and occupational health and safety laws and regulations affect healthcare facility operations these complex federal and state statutes and their enforcement involve a myriad of regulations many of which involve strict liability on the part of the potential offender some of these federal and state statutes may directly impact us under various federal state and local environmental laws ordinances and regulations an owner of real property or a secured lender such as us may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of hazardous or toxic substances at under or disposed of in connection with such property as well as other potential costs relating to hazardous or toxic substances including government fines and damages for injuries to persons and adjacent property the cost of any required remediation removal fines or personal or property damages and any related liability therefore 

 

could exceed or impair the value of the property andor the assets in addition the presence of such substances or the failure to properly dispose of or remediate such substances may adversely affect the owner’s ability to sell or rent such property or to borrow using such property as collateral which in turn could reduce our earnings for a description of the risks associated with environmental matters see “item 1a risk factors” in this report

 item 1a  risk factors   

the section below discusses the most significant risk factors that may materially adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

as set forth below we believe that the risks facing our company generally fall into the following categories 









  

risks related to our business 

we depend on a limited number of operators and tenants that account for a large percentage of our revenues 

during the year ended december 31 2014 approximately 40 of our revenues were generated by our leasing or financial arrangements with the following two companies hcrmc 26 and brookdale 14 the inability or other failure of these tenants or operators to meet their obligations to us could materially reduce our cash flow as well as our results of operations which could in turn reduce the amount of dividends we pay cause our stock price to decline and have other materially adverse effects on our business results of operations and financial condition 

in addition any failure by these tenants or operators to effectively conduct their operations or to maintain and improve our properties could adversely affect their business reputation and their ability to attract and retain patients and residents in our properties which could have a materially adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition these tenants and operators generally have also agreed to indemnify defend and hold us harmless from and against various claims litigation and liabilities arising in connection with their respective businesses and we cannot provide any assurance that they will have sufficient assets income access to financing andor insurance coverage to enable them to satisfy their indemnification obligations 

 

our ownership interest in and lease with our largest tenant hcrmc accounts for a significant portion of our assets and revenues adverse regulatory or operational developments in hcrmc’s business or financial condition could have a material adverse effect on us 

hcrmc is a provider of a range of healthcare services primarily in postacute care skilled nursing care and assisted living and our largest tenant representing 31 and 26 of our gross assets and revenues respectively as of and for the year ended december 31 2014 we also own a 94 equity interest in hcrmc which we acquired together with our april 2011 6 billion acquisition of substantially all the real estate assets of hcrmc i n december 2014 we recorded an impairment charge of 36 million for our equity ownership interest in hcrmc primarily resulting from our review of their 2015 preliminary base financial forecast and other financial information provided by hcrmc that reflected a continued shift in patient payor sources from medicare to medicare advantage which negatively impacts reimbursement rates and length of stay for hcrmc’s skilled nursing segment  

additionally hcrmc has responded to a civil investigative demand subpoenas and other requests for information regarding their skilled nursing facilities in connection with an inquiry coordinated by the us department of justice the department of health and human services office of inspector general and certain state attorneys general offices hcrmc believes it is in material compliance with all applicable laws and regulations however since the review is ongoing the ultimate outcome is uncertain and could among other things 1 require substantial time and costs to continue to respond to and defend hcrmc’s actions 2 require hcrmc to refund or adjust amounts previously paid for services under governmental programs 3 require payment of substantial fines penalties or other sanctions 4 result in the loss of hcrmc’s right to participate in the medicare or medicaid programs or 5 cause damage to hcrmc’s reputation  

continued deterioration in hcrmc’s operating performance or other adverse developments in its business operating and regulatory affairs or financial condition could reduce the revenues we earn under our master lease with hcrmc andor impair the value of our master lease with hcrmc either of which could have a material adverse effect on us 

see additional information regarding the aforementioned impairment charge 94 equity interest in hcrmc and master lease with hcrmc in i item 7 “results of operations” postacuteskilled nursing segment 20142013 comparison and ii note 6 dfls note 8 unconsolidated joint ventures and note 17 impairments to the consolidated financial statements 

the properties managed by brookdale account for a significant portion of our revenues and operating income adverse developments in brookdale’s business and affairs or financial condition could have a materially adverse effect on us 

as of january 1 2015 brookdale managed 69 senior housing facilities that we own and 14 ccrcs owned by our unconsolidated joint venture pursuant to longterm management agreements these properties represent a substantial portion of our portfolio based on their gross book value and account for a significant portion of our revenues and noi although we have various rights as the property owner under our management agreements we rely on brookdale’s personnel expertise technical resources and information systems proprietary information good faith and judgment to manage our senior living operations efficiently and effectively we also rely on brookdale to set appropriate resident fees to provide accurate propertylevel financial results for our properties in a timely manner and to otherwise operate our senior housing communities in compliance with the terms of our management agreements and all applicable laws and regulations 

in its capacity as a manager brookdale does not lease our properties and therefore we are not directly exposed to their credit risk in the same manner or to the same extent as a triplenet tenant however any adverse developments in brookdale’s business and affairs or financial condition could impair its ability to manage our properties efficiently and effectively and could have a materially adverse effect on us brookdale is also one of our triple  net tenants if brookdale experiences any significant financial legal accounting or regulatory difficulties due to a weak economy or otherwise such difficulties could result in among other adverse events acceleration of its indebtedness impairment of its continued access to capital the enforcement of default remedies by its counterparties or the commencement of insolvency proceedings by or against it under the us bankruptcy code any one or a combination of which indirectly could have a materially adverse effect on us 

 

the bankruptcy insolvency or financial deterioration of one or more of our major tenants or operators may materially adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

we lease our properties directly to operators in most cases and in certain other cases we lease to third party tenants who enter into longterm management agreements with operators to manage the properties although our leases financing arrangements and other agreements with our tenants and operators generally provide us the right under specified circumstances to terminate a lease evict a tenant or operator or demand immediate repayment of certain obligations to us the bankruptcy and insolvency laws afford certain rights to a party that has filed for bankruptcy or reorganization that may render certain of these remedies unenforceable or at the least delay our ability to pursue such remedies for example we cannot evict a tenant or operator solely because of its bankruptcy filing a debtor has the right to assume or to assume and assign to a third party or to reject its unexpired contracts in a bankruptcy proceeding if a debtor were to reject its leases with us our claim against the debtor for unpaid and future rents would be limited by the statutory cap set forth in the us bankruptcy code which may be substantially less than the remaining rent actually owed under the lease in addition a debtor may assert in a bankruptcy proceeding that our lease should be recharacterized as a financing agreement in which case our rights and remedies as a lender compared to a landlord generally would be more limited  

also if a debtormanager seeks bankruptcy protection the automatic stay provisions of the us bankruptcy code would preclude us from enforcing our remedies against the manager unless relief is first obtained from the court having jurisdiction over the bankruptcy case in any of these events we also may be required to fund certain expenses and obligations eg real estate taxes debt costs and maintenance expenses to preserve the value of our properties avoid the imposition of liens on our properties or transition our properties to a new tenant operator or manager furthermore many of our facilities are leased to healthcare providers who provide longterm custodial care to the elderly evicting such operators for failure to pay rent while the facility is occupied may involve specific procedural requirements and may not be successful  

additionally the   financial weakness or other inability of our tenants or operators to make payments or comply with certain other lease obligations may affect our compliance with certain covenants contained in our debt securities credit facilities and the mortgages on the properties leased or managed by such tenants and operators  or otherwise adversely affect our results of operations  under certain conditions defaults under the underlying mortgages may result in cross default under our other indebtedness although we believe that we would be able to secure amendments under the applicable agreements in those circumstances the bankruptcy of an applicable tenant or operator may potentially result in less favorable borrowing terms than currently available delays in the availability of funding or other materially adverse consequences  

increased competition has resulted and may further result in lower net revenues for some of our tenants and operators and may affect their ability to meet their financial and other contractual obligations to us 

the healthcare industry is highly competitive the occupancy levels at and rental income from our facilities are dependent on our ability and the ability of our tenants and operators to compete with other tenants and operators on a number of different levels including the quality of care provided reputation the physical appearance of a facility price the range of services offered family preference alternatives for healthcare delivery the supply of competing properties physicians staff referral sources location  and the size and demographics of the population in the surrounding area  

our tenants and operators also compete with numerous other companies providing similar healthcare services or alternatives such as home health agencies life care at home community  based service programs retirement communities and convalescent centers such competition which is due in part to historical over development in some segments in which we invest has caused the occupancy rate of newly constructed buildings to slow and the monthly rate that many newly built and previously existing facilities were able to obtain for their services to decrease we cannot be certain that the tenants and operators of all of our facilities will be able to achieve occupancy and rate levels that will enable them to meet all of their obligations to us further many competing companies may have resources and attributes that are superior to those of our tenants and operators thus our tenants and operators may encounter increased competition in the future that could limit their ability to maintain or attract residents or expand their businesses which could materially adversely affect their ability to meet their financial and other contractual obligations to us potentially decreasing our revenues impairing our assets and or increasing our collection and dispute costs  

 

competition may make it difficult to identify and purchase or develop suitable healthcare facilities to grow our investment portfolio  to finance acquisitions on favorable terms or to retain or attract tenants and operators  

we face significant competition from other reits investment companies private equity and hedge fund investors sovereign funds healthcare operators lenders developers and other institutional investors some of whom may have greater resources and lower costs of capital than we do increased competition makes it more challenging for us to identify and successfully capitalize on opportunities that meet our business goals and could improve the bargaining power of property owners seeking to sell thereby impeding our investment acquisition and development activities similarly our properties face competition for tenants and operators from other properties in the same market which may affect our ab i lity to attract and retain tenants and operators or may reduce the rents we are able to charge if we cannot capitalize on our development pipeline identify and purchase a sufficient quantity of healthcare facilities at favorable prices finance acquisitions on commercially favorable terms or attract and retain profitable tenants and operators our business results of operations and financial condition may be materially adversely affected 

economic and other conditions that negatively affect geographic areas to which a greater percentage of our revenue is attributed could materially adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

for the year ended december 31 2014 approximately 35 of our revenue was derived from properties located in california 23 and texas 12 as a result we are subject to increased exposure to adverse conditions affecting these regions including downturns in the local economies or changes in local real estate conditions increased competition or decreased demand changes in statespecific legislation and local climate events and natural disasters such as earthquakes wildfires and hurricanes which could adversely affect our business and results of operations 

we may be required to incur substantial renovation costs to make certain of our healthcare properties suitable for other tenants and operators 

healthcare facilities are typically highly customized and may not be easily adapted to nonhealthcarerelated uses the improvements generally required to conform a property to healthcare use such as upgrading electrical gas and plumbing infrastructure are costly and at times tenantspecific a new or replacement tenant or operator may require different features in a property depending on that tenant’s or operator’s particular business if a current tenant or operator is unable to pay rent andor vacates a property we may incur substantial expenditures to modify a property before we are able to secure another tenant or operator or to accommodate multiple tenants or operators these expenditures or renovations may materially adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

we face additional risks associated with property development that can render a project less profitable or not profitable at all and under certain circumstances prevent completion of development activities once undertaken 

largescale groundup development of healthcare properties presents additional risks for us including risks that 











 

our use of joint ventures may limit our flexibility with jointly owned investments 

we have and may continue in the future to develop andor acquire properties in joint ventures with other persons or entities when circumstances warrant the use of these structures our participation in joint ventures is subject to risks that may not be present with other methods of ownership including 













from time to time we acquire other companies and if we are unable to successfully integrate these operations our business results of operations and financial condition may be materially adversely affected 

acquisitions require the integration of companies that have previously operated independently successful integration of the operations of these companies depends primarily on our ability to consolidate operations systems procedures properties and personnel and to eliminate redundancies and costs we may encounter difficulties in these integrations potential difficulties associated with acquisitions include the loss of key employees the disruption of our ongoing business or that of the acquired entity possible inconsistencies in standards controls procedures and policies and the assumption of unexpected liabilities including 











in addition the acquired companies and their properties may fail to perform as expected including in respect of estimated cost savings inaccurate assumptions regarding future rental or occupancy rates could result in overly optimistic estimates of future revenues similarly we may underestimate future operating expenses or the costs necessary to bring properties up to standards established for their intended use if we have difficulties with any of these areas or if we later discover additional liabilities or experience unforeseen costs relating to our acquired companies we might not achieve the economic benefits we expect from our acquisitions and this may materially adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

from time to time we have made and in the future we may seek to make one or more material acquisitions which may involve the expenditure of significant funds 

we regularly review potential transactions in order to maximize stockholder value future acquisitions may require the issuance of securities the incurrence of debt assumption of contingent liabilities or incurrence of significant expenditures each of which could materially adversely impact our business financial condition or results of operations in addition the 

 

financing required for such acquisitions may not be available on commercially favorable terms or at all 

our tenants and operators may not procure the necessary insurance to adequately insure against losses 

our leases generally require our tenants and operators to secure and maintain comprehensive liability and property insurance that covers us as well as the tenants and operators certain losses may not be adequately insured by our tenants and operators for example many healthcare companies utilize different organizational and corporate structures coupled with selfinsurance trusts or captive programs that may provide less insurance coverage than a traditional insurance policy companies that insure any part of their general and professional liability risks through their own captive limited purpose entities may underestimate the future cost of claims and reserves for future claims may not be adequate to cover the actual cost of those claims should an uninsured loss or a loss in excess of insured limits occur we could incur liability or lose all or a portion of the capital we have invested in a property as well as the anticipated future revenues from the property in such an event we might nevertheless remain obligated for any mortgage debt or other financial obligations related to the property we continually review the insurance maintained by our tenants and operators and believe the coverage provided to be customary for similarly situated companies in our industry however we cannot provide any assurances that we will continue to require the same level of insurance coverage of our tenants and operators or that such insurance will be available at a reasonable cost in the future also we cannot assure you that material uninsured losses or losses in excess of insurance proceeds will not occur in the future 

our tenants and operators face litigation and may experience rising liability and insurance costs 

in some states advocacy groups have been created to monitor the quality of care at healthcare facilities and these groups have brought litigation against the tenants and operators of such facilities also in several instances private litigation by patients has resulted in large damage awards for alleged abuses the effect of this litigation and other potential litigation may materially increase the costs incurred by our tenants and operators for monitoring and reporting quality of care compliance in addition their cost of liability and medical malpractice insurance can be significant and may increase or not be available at a reasonable cost so long as the present healthcare litigation environment continues cost increases could cause our operators to be unable to make their lease or mortgage payments or fail to purchase the appropriate liability and malpractice insurance potentially decreasing our revenues and increasing our collection and litigation costs in addition as a result of our ownership of healthcare facilities we may be named as a defendant in lawsuits allegedly arising from the actions of our tenants or operators for which claims such tenants and operators have agreed to indemnify defend and hold us harmless from and against but which may require unanticipated expenditures on our part 

the requirements of or changes to governmental reimbursement programs such as medicare or medicaid may adversely affect our operators’ ability to meet their financial and other contractual obligations to us 

certain of our tenants and operators are affected by an extremely complex set of federal state and local laws and regulations pertaining to governmental reimbursement programs such laws and regulations are subject to frequent and substantial changes that are sometimes applied retroactively see “item 1—business—government regulation licensing and enforcement” above for example to the extent that any of our tenants or operators receive a significant portion of their revenues from governmental payors primarily medicare and medicaid such revenues may be subject to 



















 

if our tenants and operators fail to comply with the extensive laws regulations and other requirements applicable to their business and the operation of our properties they could become ineligible to receive reimbursement from governmental reimbursement programs face bans on admissions of new patients or residents suffer civil or criminal penalties or be required to make significant changes to their operations our tenants also could be forced to expend considerable resources responding to an investigation or other enforcement action under applicable laws or regulations in such event the results of operations and financial condition of our tenants and the results of operations of our properties operated by those entities could be adversely affected which in turn could have a materially adverse effect on us we are unable to predict future federal state and local regulations and legislation including the medicare and medicaid statutes and regulations or the intensity of enforcement efforts with respect to such regulations and legislation and any changes in the regulatory framework could have a materially adverse effect on our tenants which in turn could have a materially adverse effect on us 

in recent years governmental payors have frozen or reduced payments to healthcare providers due to budgetary pressures healthcare reimbursement will likely continue to be of significant importance to federal and state authorities we cannot make any assessment as to the ultimate timing or the effect that any future legislative reforms may have on our operators’ and tenants’ costs of doing business and on the amount of reimbursement by government and other thirdparty payors the failure of any of our tenants or operators to comply with these laws and regulations and significant limits on the scope of services reimbursed and on reimbursement rates and fees could materially adversely affect their ability to meet their financial and contractual obligations to us 

legislation to address federal government operations and administration decisions affecting the centers for medicare and medicaid services could have a materially adverse effect on our operators’ liquidity financial condition or results of operations 

enactment of the consolidated appropriations act of 2014 and congressional consideration of legislation pertaining to the federal debt ceiling the affordable care act as defined below  tax reform and entitlement programs including reimbursement rates for physicians could have a materially adverse effect on our operators’ liquidity financial condition or results of operations in particular changes in funding for entitlement programs such as medicare and medicaid may result in increased costs and fees for programs such as medicare advantage plans and additional reductions in reimbursements to providers additionally amendments to the patient protection and affordable care act along with the health care and education reconciliation act of 2010 collectively the “affordable care act” implementation of the affordable care act and decisions by the centers for medicare and medicaid services could impact the delivery of services and benefits under medicare medicaid or medicare advantage plans and could affect our tenants and operators and the manner in which they are reimbursed by such programs such changes could have a materially adverse effect on our operators’ liquidity financial condition or results of operations which could adversely affect their ability to satisfy their obligations to us and could have a materially adverse effect on us  

furthermore the supreme court’s decision upholding the constitutionality of the individual healthcare mandate while striking down the provisions linking federal funding of state medicaid programs with a federally mandated expansion of those programs has contributed to the uncertainty regarding the impact that the law will have on healthcare delivery systems over the next decade we can expect that federal authorities will continue to implement the law but because of the supreme court’s mixed ruling the implementation will take longer than originally expected with a commensurate increase in the period of uncertainty regarding the longterm financial impact on the delivery of and payment for healthcare 

tenants and operators that fail to comply with federal state local and international laws and regulations including licensure certification and inspection requirements may cease to operate or be unable to meet their financial and other contractual obligations to us 

our tenants and managers are subject to or impacted by extensive frequently changing federal state local and international laws and regulations these laws and regulations include among others laws protecting consumers against deceptive practices laws relating to the operation of our properties and how our tenants and operators conduct their operations such as fire health and safety laws and privacy laws federal and state laws affecting hospitals clinics and other healthcare communities that participate in both medicare and medicaid that mandate allowable costs pricing reimbursement procedures and limitations quality of services and care food service and physical plants a nd similar foreign laws regulating the healthcare industry  resident rights laws including abuse and neglect laws and fraud laws antikickback and physician referral laws the ada and similar state and local laws and safety and health standards set by the 

 

occupational safety and health administration or similar foreign agencies  certain of our properties may also require a license registration andor certificate of need to operate 

our tenants’ or operators’ failure to comply with any of these laws regulations or requirements could result in loss of accreditation denial of reimbursement imposition of fines suspension or decertification from government healthcare programs loss of license or closure of the facility andor the incurrence of considerable costs arising from an investigation or regulatory action which may have an adverse effect on facilities owned by or mortgaged to us and therefore may materially adversely impact us see “item 1—business—government regulation licensing and enforcement—healthcare licensure and certificate of need” above 

our tenants in the life science industry face high levels of regulation expense and uncertainty 

life science tenants particularly those involved in developing and marketing pharmaceutical products are subject to certain unique risks including the following 











if our tenants’ businesses are adversely affected they may have difficulty making payments to us which could materially adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

we may be unable to successfully foreclose on the collateral securing our real estaterelated loans and even if we are successful in our foreclosure efforts we may be unable to successfully operate occupy or reposition the underlying real estate which may adversely affect our ability to recover our investments 

if a tenant or operator defaults under one of our mortgages or mezzanine loans we may have to foreclose on the loan or protect our interest by acquiring title to the collateral and thereafter making substantial improvements or repairs in order to maximize the property’s investment potential in some cases the collateral consists of the equity interests in an entity that directly or indirectly owns the applicable real property or interests in operating facilities and accordingly we may not have full recourse to assets of that entity tenants operators or borrowers may contest enforcement of foreclosure or other remedies seek bankruptcy protection against our exercise of enforcement or other remedies andor bring claims for lender liability in response to actions to enforce mortgage obligations foreclosurerelated costs high loantovalue ratios or declines in the value of the facility may prevent us from realizing an amount equal to our mortgage or mezzanine loan upon foreclosure and we may be required to record a valuation allowance for such losses even if we are able to successfully foreclose on the collateral securing our real estaterelated loans we may inherit properties for which we may be unable to expeditiously seek tenants or operators if at all or we may acquire equity interests that we are unable to immediately resell due to limitations under the securities laws either of which would adversely affect our ability to fully recover our investment 

required regulatory approvals can delay or prohibit transfers of our healthcare facilities 

transfers of healthcare facilities to successor tenants or operators may be subject to regulatory approvals or ratifications including but not limited to change of ownership approvals under certificate of need laws and medicare and medicaid provider arrangements that are not required for transfers of other types of commercial operations and other types of real estate the replacement of any tenant or operator could be delayed by the regulatory approval process of any federal state 

 

or local government agency necessary for the transfer of the facility or the replacement of the operator licensed to manage the facility if we are unable to find a suitable replacement tenant or operator upon favorable terms or at all we may take possession of a facility which might expose us to successor liability require us to indemnify subsequent operators to whom we might transfer the operating rights and licenses or spend substantial time and funds to adapt the facility to other uses all of which may materially adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

risks related to our capital structure and market conditions 

volatility disruption or uncertainty in the financial markets may impair our ability to raise capital obtain new financing or refinance existing obligations and fund real estate and development activities 

the global financial markets have experienced pervasive and fundamental disruptions while these conditions have stabilized since the first quarter of 2009 and the capital markets continue to show signs of improvement the strength and sustainability of an economic recovery is uncertain additional levels of market disruption volatility or uncertainty could materially adversely impact our ability to raise capital obtain new financing or refinance our existing obligations as they mature and fund real estate and development activities 

market volatility could also lead to significant uncertainty in the valuation of our investments and those of our joint ventures which may result in a substantial decrease in the value of our properties and those of our joint ventures as a result we may not be able to recover the carrying amount of such investments and the associated goodwill if any which may require us to recognize impairment charges in earnings 

we rely on external sources of capital to fund future capital needs and limitations on our access to such capital could have a materially adverse effect on our ability to meet commitments as they become due or make future investments necessary to grow our business 

we may not be able to fund all future capital needs from cash retained from operations if we are unable to obtain enough internal capital we may need to rely on external sources of capital including debt and equity financing to fulfill our capital requirements our access to capital depends upon a number of factors some of which we have little or no control over including but not limited to 





















if our access to capital is limited by these factors or other factors it could have a materially adverse impact on our ability to fund operations repay or refinance our debt obligations fund dividend payments acquire properties and make the investments needed to grow our business 

 

adverse changes in our credit ratings could impair our ability to obtain additional debt and equity financing on favorable terms if at all and negatively impact the market price of our securities including our common stock 

our credit ratings can affect the amount and type of capital we can access as well as the terms of any financings we may obtain there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain our current credit ratings and in the event that our current credit ratings deteriorate we would likely incur higher borrowing costs and it may be more difficult or expensive to obtain additional financing or refinance existing obligations and commitments also a downgrade in our credit ratings would trigger additional costs or other potentially negative consequences under our current and future credit facilities and debt instruments the credit ratings of our senior unsecured debt are based on among other things our operating performance liquidity and leverage ratios overall financial position level of indebtedness and pending or future changes in the regulatory framework applicable to our operators and our industry 

our level of indebtedness may increase and materially adversely affect our future operations 

our outstanding indebtedness as of december 31 2014 was approximately 98 billion we may incur additional indebtedness in the future including in connection with the development or acquisition of assets which may be substantial any significant additional indebtedness could negatively affect the credit ratings of our debt and require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow to interest and principal payments due on our indebtedness greater demands on our cash resources may reduce funds available to us to pay dividends conduct development activities make capital expenditures and acquisitions or carry out other aspects of our business strategy increased indebtedness can also make us more vulnerable to general adverse economic and industry conditions and create competitive disadvantages for us compared to other companies with relatively lower debt levels increased future debt service obligations may limit our operational flexibility including our ability to finance or refinance our properties contribute properties to joint ventures or sell properties as needed 

covenants in our debt instruments limit our operational flexibility and breaches of these covenants could materially adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

the terms of our current secured and unsecured debt instruments and other indebtedness that we may incur in the future require or will require us to comply with a number of customary financial and other covenants such as maintaining leverage ratios minimum tangible net worth requirements reit status and certain levels of debt service coverage our continued ability to incur additional debt and to conduct business in general is subject to compliance with these financial and other covenants which limit our operational flexibility for example mortgages on our properties contain customary covenants such as those that limit or restrict our ability without the consent of the lender to further encumber or sell the applicable properties or to replace the applicable tenant or operator breaches of certain covenants may result in defaults under the mortgages on our properties and crossdefaults under certain of our other indebtedness even if we satisfy our payment obligations to the respective obligee covenants that limit our operational flexibility as well as defaults resulting from the breach of any of these covenants could materially adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

an increase in interest rates could increase interest cost on new debt and could materially adversely impact our ability to refinance existing debt sell assets and conduct acquisition investment and development activities 

if interest rates increase so could our interest costs for any new debt this increased cost could make the financing of any acquisition and development activity more costly rising interest rates could limit our ability to refinance existing debt when it matures or cause us to pay higher interest rates upon refinancing and increase interest expense on refinanced indebtedness in addition an increase in interest rates could decrease the amount third parties are willing to pay for our assets thereby limiting our ability to reposition our portfolio promptly in response to changes in economic or other conditions 

we manage a portion of our exposure to interest rate risk by accessing debt with staggered maturities and through the use of derivative instruments primarily interest rate swap agreements however no amount of hedging activity can fully insulate us from the risks associated with changes in interest rates swap agreements involve risk including that counterparties may fail to honor their obligations under these arrangements that these arrangements may not be effective in reducing our exposure to interest rate changes that the amount of income we earn from hedging transactions may be 

 

limited by federal tax provisions governing reits and that these arrangements may cause us to pay higher interest rates on our debt obligations than would otherwise be the case failure to hedge effectively against interest rate risk if we choose to engage in such activities could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

we may be adversely affected by fluctuations in currency exchange rates 

we continue to pursue growth opportunities in international markets where the us dollar is not the denominated currency the ownership of investments located outside of the united states subjects us to risk from fluctuations in exchange rates between foreign currencies and the us dollar a significant change in the value of the british pound or other currencies in countries where we have a significant investment may have a materially adverse effect on our financial position debt covenant ratios results of operations and cash flow 

we may attempt to manage the impact of foreign currency exchange rate changes through the use of derivative contracts or other methods for example as of january 30 2015 we have £492 million in debt investments and maintain an equal amount of unsecured gbp denominated debt as a natural hedge additionally we executed currency swap contracts to hedge the risk related to a portion of the forecasted interest receipts on these investments however no amount of hedging activity can fully insulate us from the risks associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates and the failure to hedge effectively against foreign currency exchange rate risk if we choose to engage in such activities could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition in addition any international currency gain recognized with respect to changes in exchange rates may not qualify under the 75 gross income test or the 95 gross income test that we must satisfy annually in order to qualify and maintain our status as a reit 

  

  

risks related to other events 

we are subject to certain provisions of maryland law and our charter relating to business combinations which may prevent a transaction that may otherwise be in the interest of our stockholders 

the maryland business combination act provides that unless exempted a maryland corporation may not engage in business combinations including a merger consolidation share exchange or in circumstances specified in the statute an asset transfer or issuance or reclassification of equity securities with an “interested stockholder” or an affiliate of an interested stockholder for five years after the most recent date on which the interested stockholder became an interested stockholder and thereafter unless specified criteria are met an interested stockholder is generally a person owning or controlling directly or indirectly 10 or more of the voting power of the outstanding voting stock of a maryland corporation unless our board of directors takes action to exempt us generally or with respect to certain transactions from this statute in the future the maryland business combination act will be applicable to business combinations between us and other persons 

in addition to the restrictions on business combinations contained in the maryland business combination act our charter also contains restrictions on business combinations our charter requires that except in certain circumstances “business combinations” including a merger or consolidation and certain asset transfers and issuances of securities with a “related person” including a beneficial owner of 10 or more of our outstanding voting stock be approved by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 90 of our outstanding voting stock 

the restrictions on business combinations provided under maryland law and contained in our charter may delay defer or prevent a change of control or other transaction even if such transaction involves a premium price for our common stock or our stockholders believe that such transaction is otherwise in their best interests 

unfavorable resolution of litigation matters and disputes could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition 

from time to time we are involved in legal proceedings lawsuits and other claims we may also be named as defendants in lawsuits arising out of our alleged actions or the alleged actions of our tenants and operators for which such tenants and operators have agreed to indemnify defend and hold us harmless an unfavorable resolution of any such litigation may have a materially adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition regardless of the outcome litigation or other legal proceedings may result in substantial costs disruption of our normal business operations and the 

 

diversion of management attention there can be no assurance that we will be able to prevail in or achieve a favorable settlement of any pending or future legal action against us 

loss of our key personnel could temporarily disrupt our operations and adversely affect us 

we are dependent on the efforts of our executive officers and competition for these individuals is intense although our chief executive officer chief financial officer chief investment officer and general counsel have employment agreements with us we cannot assure you that they will remain employed with us the loss or limited availability of the services of any of our executive officers or our inability to recruit and retain qualified personnel in the future could at least temporarily have a materially adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition and the value of our common stock 

we may experience uninsured or underinsured losses which could result in a significant loss of the capital invested in a property lower than expected future revenues or unanticipated expense 

we maintain comprehensive insurance coverage on our properties with terms conditions limits and deductibles that we believe are adequate and appropriate given the relative risk and costs of such coverage and we regularly review our insurance coverage however a large number of our properties are located in areas exposed to earthquake windstorm flood and other natural disasters and may be subject to other losses in particular our life science portfolio is concentrated in areas known to be subject to earthquake activity while we purchase insurance coverage for earthquake windstorm flood and other natural disasters that we believe is adequate in light of current industry practice and analyses prepared by outside consultants there is no assurance that such insurance will fully cover such losses these losses can result in decreased anticipated revenues from a property and the loss of all or a portion of the capital we have invested in a property following these events we may remain liable for any mortgage debt or other financial obligations related to the property the insurance market for such exposures can be very volatile and we may be unable to purchase the limits and terms we desire on a commercially reasonable basis in the future in addition there are certain exposures for which we do not purchase insurance because we do not believe it is economically feasible to do so or where there is no viable insurance market 

environmental compliance costs and liabilities associated with our real estaterelated investments may be substantial and may materially impair the value of those investments 

federal state and local laws ordinances and regulations may require us as a current or previous owner of real estate to investigate and clean up certain hazardous or toxic substances or petroleum released at a property we may be held liable to a governmental entity or to third parties for property damage and for investigation and cleanup costs incurred by the third parties in connection with the contamination the costs of cleanup and remediation could be substantial in addition some environmental laws create a lien on the contaminated site in favor of the government for damages and the costs it incurs in connection with the contamination 

although we currently carry environmental insurance on our properties in an amount that we believe is commercially reasonable and generally require our tenants and operators to indemnify us for environmental liabilities they cause such liabilities could exceed the amount of our insurance the financial ability of the tenant or operator to indemnify us or the value of the contaminated property as the owner of a site we may also be held liable to third parties for damages and injuries resulting from environmental contamination emanating from the site including the release of asbestoscontaining materials into the air we may also experience environmental liabilities arising from conditions not known to us the cost of defending against these claims complying with environmental regulatory requirements conducting remediation of any contaminated property or paying personal injury or other claims or fines could be substantial and could have a materially adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

in addition the presence of contamination or the failure to remediate contamination may materially adversely affect our ability to use sell or lease the property or to borrow using the property as collateral 

 

we rely on information technology in our operations and any material failure inadequacy interruption or security failure of that technology could harm our business 

we rely on information technology networks and systems including the internet to process transmit and store electronic information and to manage or support a variety of business processes including financial transactions and records and maintaining personal identifying information and tenant and lease data we purchase some of our information technology from vendors on whom our systems depend we rely on commercially available systems software tools and monitoring to provide security for the processing transmission and storage of confidential tenant and customer data including individually identifiable information relating to financial accounts although we have taken steps to protect the security of our information systems and the data maintained in those systems it is possible that our safety and security measures will not prevent the systems’ improper functioning or damage or the improper access or disclosure of personally identifiable information such as in the event of cyberattacks security breaches including physical or electronic breakins computer viruses attacks by hackers and similar breaches can create system disruptions shutdowns or unauthorized disclosure of confidential information the risk of security breaches has generally increased as the number intensity and sophistication of attacks have increased in some cases it may be difficult to anticipate or immediately detect such incidents and the damage they cause any failure to maintain proper function security and availability of our information systems could interrupt our operations damage our reputation subject us to liability claims or regulatory penalties and could have a materially adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

risk related to tax including reitrelated risks 

loss of our tax status as a reit would substantially reduce our available funds and would have materially adverse consequences for us and the value of our common stock 

qualification as a reit involves the application of numerous highly technical and complex provisions of the internal revenue code of 1986 as amended the “code” for which there are only limited judicial and administrative interpretations as well as the determination of various factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control we intend to continue to operate in a manner that enables us to qualify as a reit however our qualification and taxation as a reit depend upon our ability to meet through actual annual operating results asset diversification distribution levels and diversity of stock ownership the various qualification tests imposed under the code for example to qualify as a reit at least 95 of our gross income in any year must be derived from qualifying sources and we must make distributions to our stockholders aggregating annually at least 90 of our reit taxable income excluding net capital gains in addition new legislation regulations administrative interpretations or court decisions could change the tax laws or interpretations of the tax laws regarding qualification as a reit or the federal income tax consequences of that qualification in a manner that is materially adverse to our stockholders accordingly there is no assurance that we have operated or will continue to operate in a manner so as to qualify or remain qualified as a reit 

if we lose our reit status we will face serious tax consequences that will substantially reduce the funds available to make payments of principal and interest on the debt securities we issue and to make distributions to stockholders if we fail to qualify as a reit 









as a result of all these factors our failure to qualify as a reit could also impair our ability to expand our business and raise capital and could materially adversely affect the value of our common stock 

the present federal income tax treatment of reits may be modified possibly with retroactive effect by legislative judicial or administrative action at any time which could affect the federal income tax treatment of an investment in us the federal income tax rules dealing with reits constantly are under review by persons involved in the legislative process the us 

 

internal revenue service the “irs” and the us treasury department which results in statutory changes as well as frequent revisions to regulations and interpretations revisions in federal tax laws and interpretations thereof could affect or cause us to change our investments and commitments and affect the tax considerations of an investment in us 

we could have potential deferred and contingent tax liabilities from corporate acquisitions that could limit delay or impede future sales of our properties 

if during the tenyear period beginning on the date we acquire certain companies we recognize a gain on the disposition of any property acquired then to the extent of the excess of i the fair market value of such property as of the acquisition date over ii our adjusted income tax basis in such property as of that date we will be required to pay a corporatelevel federal income tax on this gain at the highest regular corporate rate there can be no assurance that these triggering dispositions will not occur and these requirements could limit delay or impede future sales of our properties 

in addition the irs may assert liabilities against us for corporate income taxes for taxable years prior to the time that we acquire certain companies in which case we will owe these taxes plus interest and penalties if any 

there are uncertainties relating to the calculation of nonreit tax earnings and profits “ep” in certain acquisitions which may require us to distribute ep 

in order to remain qualified as a reit we are required to distribute to our stockholders all of the accumulated nonreit ep of certain companies that we acquire prior to the close of the first taxable year in which the acquisition occurs failure to make such ep distributions would result in our disqualification as a reit the determination of the amount to be distributed in such ep distributions is a complex factual and legal determination we may have less than complete information at the time we undertake our analysis or we may interpret the applicable law differently from the irs we currently believe that we have satisfied the requirements relating to such ep distributions there are however substantial uncertainties relating to the determination of ep including the possibility that the irs could successfully assert that the taxable income of the companies acquired should be increased which would increase our nonreit ep moreover an audit of the acquired company following our acquisition could result in an increase in accumulated nonreit ep which could require us to pay an additional taxable distribution to our thenexisting stockholders if we qualify under rules for curing this type of default or could result in our disqualification as a reit 

thus we might fail to satisfy the requirement that we distribute all of our nonreit ep by the close of the first taxable year in which the acquisition occurs moreover although there are procedures available to cure a failure to distribute all of our ep we cannot now determine whether we will be able to take advantage of these procedures or the economic impact on us of doing so 

our international expansion may result in additional taxrelated risks  

we have recently expanded our operations to include the united kingdom and may continue to expand internationally international expansion presents taxrelated risks that are different from those we face with respect to our domestic properties and operations these risks include but are not limited to 







our charter contains ownership limits with respect to our common stock and other classes of capital stock 

our charter contains restrictions on the ownership and transfer of our common stock and preferred stock that are intended to assist us in preserving our qualification as a reit under our charter subject to certain exceptions no person or entity may own actually or constructively more than 98 by value or by number of shares whichever is more restrictive of the outstanding shares of our common stock or any class or series of our preferred stock 

 

additionally our charter has a 99 ownership limitation on the direct or indirect ownership of our voting shares which may include common stock or other classes of capital stock our board of directors in its sole discretion may exempt a proposed transferee from either ownership limit the ownership limits may delay defer or prevent a transaction or a change of control that might involve a premium price for our common stock or might otherwise be in the best interests of our stockholders

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

the information set forth in this item 7 is intended to provide readers with an understanding of our financial condition changes in financial condition and results of operations we will discuss and provide our analysis in the following order 





















2014 transaction overview 

investment transactions 

in 2014 we completed 21 billion of investment transactions including 777 million £483 million in debt and real estate in the united kingdom “uk” and 588 million for our 49 interest in the industry’s largest ccrc joint venture which transactions are further described below 

brookdale lease amendments and terminations and the formation of two ridea joint ventures “brookdale transaction” 

on august 29 2014 hcp and brookdale through a master contribution and transactions agreement closed a multipleelement transaction that has three major components 







£395 million debt investment in u  k  care home portfolio 

in november 2014 we were the lead investor in the financing for formation capital and safanad’s acquisition of nhp a company that at closing owned 273 nursing and residential care homes representing over 12500 beds in the uk principally operated by hcone we provided a loan facility   totaling 630 million £395 million  secured by substantially all of nhp’s assets with £36 3 million drawn at closing 

 

other investment transactions 

during the year ended december 31 2014 we completed 634 million of additional investments and commitments in 34 properties across our senior housing life science and medical office segments including 147 million  £88 million for 23 care homes in the uk additionally we funded 287 million for construction and other capital projects primarily in our life science medical office and senior housing segments 

  

financing activities 

we r aised 21 billion of debt in 2014   and through january 2015  including the following transactions 









on march 31 2014 we amended our unsecured revolving credit facility and increased it by 500 million to 2 billion the amended facility reduces our funded interest cost by 175 basis points and extends the maturity date to march 31 2018 based on our current credit ratings the amended facility bears interest annually at libor plus 925 basis points and has a facility fee of 150 basis points other terms of the amended facility were substantially unchanged including a oneyear extension option at our discretion and the ability to increase the commitments by an aggregate amount of up to 500 million subject to customary conditions   

during the year ended december 31 2014 we repaid 911 million of aggregate senior unsecured notes and mortgage debt with a weighted average interest rate of 433 

dividends 

quarterly dividends paid during 2014 aggregated 218 per share which represents a 38 increase from 2013 on january 29 2015 our board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of 0565 per common share the annualized distribution rate per share for 2015 increased 37 to 226 compared to 218 for 2014 the dividend will be paid on february 24 2015 to stockholders of record as of the close of business on february 9 2015 

results of operations 

we evaluate our business and allocate resources among our five business segments i senior housing ii postacuteskilled nursing iii life science iv medical office and v hospital under the medical office segment we invest through the acquisition and development of mobs which generally require a greater level of property management otherwise we primarily invest through the acquisition and development of real estate in single tenants and operators occupied properties and debt issued by tenants and operators in these sectors the accounting policies of the segments are the same as those described in the summary of significant accounting policies see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements 

nongaap financial measures 

same property portfolio 

our evaluation of results of operations by each business segment includes an analysis of noi and adjusted noi of our same property portfolio “spp” and our total property portfolio we believe noi provides relevant and useful information because it reflects only income and operating expense items that are incurred at the property level and presents them on an 

 

unleveraged basis we use noi and adjusted noi to make decisions about resource allocations and to assess and compare property level performance spp noi and adjusted noi information allows us to evaluate the performance of our property portfolio under a consistent population by eliminating changes in the composition of our portfolio of properties we identify our spp as stabilized properties that remained in operations and were consistently reported as leased properties or ridea properties for the duration of the year ‑over ‑year comparison periods presented accordingly it takes a stabilized property a minimum of 12 months in operations under a consistent reporting structure to be included in our spp newly acquired operating assets are generally considered stabilized at the earlier of lease ‑up typically when the tenants controls the physical use of at least 80 of the space or 12 months from the acquisition date newly completed developments and redevelopments are considered stabilized at the earlier of lease ‑up or 24 months from the date the property is placed in service spp noi excludes certain non ‑property specific operating expenses that are allocated to each operating segment on a consolidated basis a property is removed from our spp when it is sold or placed into redevelopment noi and adjusted noi are nongaap supplemental financial measures for a reconciliation of net income to noi and adjusted noi and other relevant disclosure refer to note 14 to the consolidated financial statements 

operating expenses generally relate to leased medical office and life science properties and senior housing ridea properties we generally recover all or a portion of our leased medical office and life science property expenses through tenant recoveries we present expenses as operating or general and administrative based on the underlying nature of the expense periodically we review the classification of expenses between categories and make revisions based on changes in the underlying nature of the expenses 

funds from operations   

we believe ffo applicable to common shares diluted ffo applicable to common shares and diluted ffo per common share are important supplemental nongaap measures of operating performance for a reit because the historical cost accounting convention used for real estate assets utilizes straightline depreciation except on land such accounting presentation implies that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time since real estate values instead have historically risen and fallen with market conditions presentations of operating results for a reit that use historical cost accounting for depreciation could be less informative the term ffo was designed by the reit industry to address this issue 

ffo as defined by the national association of real estate investment trusts “nareit” is net income applicable to common shares computed in accordance with gaap excluding gains or losses from sales of property impairments of or related to depreciable real estate plus real estate and dfl depreciation and amortization and after adjustments for joint ventures adjustments for joint ventures are calculated to reflect ffo on the same basis  ffo does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with gaap is not necessarily indicative of cash available to fund cash needs and should not be considered an alternative to net income we compute ffo in accordance with the current nareit definition however other reits may report ffo differently or have a different interpretation of the current nareit definition from ours 

in addition we present ffo before the impact of severance ‑related charges litigation settlement charges preferred stock redemption charges impairments recoveries of non ‑depreciable assets and transaction ‑related items defined below “ffo as adjusted” transactionrelated items include acquisition and pursuit costs eg due diligence and closing and gainscharges incurred as a result of mergers and acquisitions and lease amendment or termination activities management believes that ffo as adjusted provides a meaningful supplemental measurement of our ffo runrate this measure is a modification of the nareit definition of ffo and should not be used as an alternative to net income determined in accordance with gaap or nareit ffo 

funds available for distribution 

fad is defined as ffo as adjusted after excluding the impact of the following i amortization of acquired market lease intangibles net ii amortization of deferred compensation expense iii amortization of deferred financing costs net iv straightline rents v accretion and depreciation related to dfls and vi deferred revenues  effective 2014 excluding amounts amortized into rental income that are associated with tenant funded improvements ownedrecognized by us and upfront cash payments made by tenants to reduce their contractual rents also fad is i computed after deducting recurring capital expenditures including leasing costs and second generation tenant and capital improvements and ii includes lease restructure payments and adjustments to compute our share of fad from our unconsolidated joint ventures 

 

and those related to ccrc nonrefundable entrance fees  other reits or real estate companies may use different methodologies for calculating fad and accordingly our fad may not be comparable to those reported by other reits although our fad computation may not be comparable to that of other reits management believes fad provides a meaningful supplemental measure of our ability to fund our ongoing dividend payments in addition management believes that in order to further understand and analyze our liquidity fad should not be compared with net cash flows from operating activities as determined in accordance with gaap and presented in our consolidated financial statements fad does not represent cash generated from operating activities determined in accordance with gaap and fad should not be considered as an alternative to net income determined in accordance with gaap as an indication of our performance as an alternative to net cash flows from operating activities determined in accordance with gaap or as a measure of our liquidity 

net operating income “noi” 

noi and a djusted noi are nongaap supplemental financial measures used to evaluate the operating performance of real estate noi is defined as rental and related revenues including tenant recoveries resident fees and services and income from dfls less property level operating expense noi excludes all other financial statement amounts included in net income as presented in note14 to the consolidated financial statements  management believes noi provides relevant and useful information because it reflects only income and operating expense items that are incurred at the property level and presents them on an unleveraged basis adjusted noi is calculated as noi after eliminating the effects of straightline rents dfl accretion amortization of market lease intangibles and lease termination fees adjusted noi is oftentimes referred to as “cash noi” we use noi and adjusted noi to make decisions about resource allocations and to assess and compare property level performance we believe that net income is the most directly comparable gaap measure to noi noi should not be viewed as an alternative measure of operating performance to net income as defined by gaap because it does not reflect various excluded items further our definition of noi may not be comparable to the definition used by other reits or real estate companies as those companies may use different methodologies for calculating noi

results are for the years ended december 31 2014 and 2013 dollars in thousands except per share data 





ffo increased 005 per share primarily as a result of i net gains from the brookdale transaction ii increased noi from our spp and our 2013 and 2014 acquisitions and iii a general and administrative charge in 2013 resulting from the termination of our former chief executive officer the aforementioned were partially offset by i an impairment charge in 2014 for our equity ownership investment in hcrmc and ii favorable onetime items including interest income in 2013 from the par payoff of our barchester debt investments and sale of marketable equity securities  

ffo as adjusted and fad increased 002 and 003 per share respectively primarily as a result of increased noi from our spp and 2013 and 2014 acquisitions which were partially offset by favorable onetime items including interest income in 2013 from the par payoff of our barchester debt investments and sale of marketable equity securities  

earnings per share eps decreased 013 per share primarily as a result of i decreased gain on sales of real estate and ii increased depreciation expense partially offset by the net result of the aforementioned events impacting ffo

senior housing 

as part of the previously described brookdale transaction we contributed 49 properties one property was contributed on january 1 2015 that were triplenet leased into a ridea structure with brookdale managing the communities and acquiring a 20 equity interest in the ridea partnerships for the 49 properties in the ridea partnerships we report the residentlevel revenues and corresponding operating expenses in our consolidated financial statements rather than the pretransaction triplenet rents in future periods we expect increases in resident fee and service revenue and operating expenses and a decrease in rental and related revenues 

additionally we created the ccrc jv which is managed by brookdale in future periods we expect to record our share of income from unconsolidated joint ventures also as a result of deconsolidating three senior housing properties that were contributed to the ccrc jv we expect a decrease in rental and related revenues and depreciation expense

noi and adjusted noi spp and total portfolio noi and adjusted noi increased primarily as a result of annual rent escalations from our hcrmc dfl investments 

hcrmc equity method and dfl investments   on december 19 2014 we concluded that our 94 equity ownership interest in hcrmc was otherthan temporarily impaired and we recorded an impairment charge of 36 million or 008 per diluted share in the fourth quarter of 201 4  the impairment charge reduced the carrying amount of our equity investment in hcrmc to 39 million we made this conclusion principally based on the receipt and review of hcrmc’s preliminary base financial forecast for 2015 together with hcrmc’s yeartodate operating results through november 2014 hcrmc’s preliminary base financial forecast and operating results primarily reflected a continued shift in patient payor sources from medicare to medicare advantage which negatively impact s reimbursement rates and length of stay for hcrmc’s skilled nursing segment hcrmc has indicated that its 2015 preliminary base financial forecast does not include the effect of any dispositions acquisitions or other initiatives hcrmc may undertake to improve financial performance in 2015 

we believe that hcrmc’s trailing twelvemonth fixed charge coverage “tfcc” ratio may continue to deteriorate over the next several quarters hcrmc’s 2015 preliminary base financial forecast implies that the tfcc ratio is projected to decline to 107x at the end of 2015 compared to the tfcc ratio of 108x at the end of 2014 before the impact of 24 million of certain general and professional liability charges that hcrmc incurred in the second quarter of 2014 as noted above the tfcc ratio is calculated using hcrmc’s 2015 preliminary base financial forecast that does not include the effects of any dispositions acquisitions or other initiatives hcrmc may undertake to improve financial performance in 2015 

notwithstanding these developments hcrmc’s 2015 preliminary base financial forecast also indicates that hcrmc will continue to meet its contractual obligations to us under a master lease the “master lease” therefore we continue to believe that the collection and timing of all amounts owed by hcrmc under our master lease are reasonably assured hcrmc believes that it is favorably positioned to grow as part of the ongoing changes in the healthcare environment 

 

based on discussions with the management of hcrmc and our evaluation of other industry data we note the following factors that influenced our evaluation of hcrmc i medicare rate increases of 17  and 14 took effect on october   1 2014 for the skilled nursing and hospice businesses respectively ii additional cost cutting measures were implemented in the fourth quarter of 2014 iii n ew facility developments and expansions will be operational in 2015 iv assisted living and hospice operations demonstrated continued growth v hcp and hcr manorcare have jointly agreed to market for sale certain nonstrategic assets that are under the master lease  the purpose of the dispositions is to increase ebitdar reduce rent and improve hcrmc’s tfcc however no assurances can be given that the facilities   will be sold or as to the timing of the sales  and vi hospital admissions are forecasted to improve in 2015 

while we remain confident in hcrmc’s ongoing adjustments to their business model hcrmc has not been able to reverse the decline in their financial performance failure of hcrmc to reverse the decline in its financial performance may lead us to conclude that the collection and timing of contractual obligations or a portion thereof under the master lease may not be reasonably assured in which case we would place the hcrmc dfl or a portion thereof on nonaccrual status if we further determine that it is probable that we will not be able to collect all amounts due under the terms of the master lease we may incur an impairment on our hcrmc dfl or a portion thereof

other income and expense items 

interest income interest income increased 62 million to 86 million for the year ended december 31 2013 the increase was primarily the result of interest income from the repayment of our barchester loan in september 2013 acquired earlier in 2013 at a discount additional interest income earned from the second tranche of our mezzanine loan facility to tandem health care in june 2013 and interest earned from our four seasons senior unsecured notes purchased in 2012 see notes 7 and 10 to the consolidated financial statements 

interest expense for the year ended december 31 2013 interest expense increased 19 million to 435 million the increase was primarily the result of increases in the average outstanding indebtedness during 2013 compared to 2012 and a decrease of capitalized interest in 2013 related to assets that were under development in our life science and medical office segments and were placed in service during 2013 and 2012 these increases were partially offset by a decrease in interest rates

debt 

bank line of credit and term loans on march 31 2014 we amended our unsecured revolving line of credit facility the “facility” with a syndicate of banks which was scheduled to mature in march 2016 increasing the borrowing capacity by 500 million to 2 billion the amended facility matures on march 31 2018 with a oneyear committed extension option borrowings under the facility accrue interest at libor plus a margin that depends upon our credit ratings we pay a facility fee on the entire revolving commitment that depends on our credit ratings based on our credit ratings at january 30 2015 the margin on the facility was 0925 and the facility fee was 015 the facility also includes a feature that will allow us to increase the borrowing capacity by an aggregate amount of up to 500 million subject to securing additional commitments from existing lenders or new lending institutions at december 31 2014 we had 839 million includes £355 million outstanding under the facility with a weighted average effective interest rate of 160 

on july 30 2012 we entered into a credit agreement with a syndicate of banks for a £137 million 214 million at december 31 2014 fouryear unsecured term loan the “2012 term loan” based on our credit ratings at january 30 2014 the term loan accrues interest at a rate of gbp libor plus 120 concurrent with the closing of the term loan we entered into a fouryear interest rate swap contract that fixes the rate of the term loan at 181 subject to adjustments based on our credit ratings the 2012 term loan contains a oneyear committed extension option 

on january 12 2015 we entered into a credit agreement with a syndicate of banks for a £220 million 333 million fouryear unsecured term loan   the “2015 term loan” that accrues interest at a rate of gbp libor plus 0975 subject to adjustments based on our credit ratings at closing we entered into a threeyear interest rate swap agreement that effectively fixes the rate of the term loan at 179  the 2012 and 2015 t erm l oans are collectively the “term loans” proceeds from the 2015 term loan were used to repay £220 million outstanding on the facility as of the closing date 

the facility and term loans contain certain financial restrictions and other customary requirements among other things these covenants using terms defined in the agreements i limit the ratio of consolidated total indebtedness to consolidated total asset value to 60 ii limit the ratio of secured debt to consolidated total asset value to 30 iii limit the ratio of unsecured debt to consolidated unencumbered asset value to 60 and iv require a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio of 15 times the facility and term loans also require a minimum consolidated tangible net worth of 95 billion at december 31 2014   applicable to the facility and 2012 term loan at december 31 2014 we were in compliance with each of these restrictions and requirements of the facility and 2012 term loan 

senior unsecured notes at december 31 2014 we had senior unsecured notes outstanding with an aggregate principal balance of 76 billion interest rates on the notes ranged from 279 to 699 with a weighted average effective interest rate of 495 and a weighted average maturity of six years at december 31 2014 the senior unsecured notes contain certain covenants including limitations on debt maintenance of unencumbered assets crossacceleration provisions and other customary terms at december 31 2014 we believe we were in compliance with these covenants 

on january 21 2015 we issued 600 million of 340 senior unsecured notes due 2025 the notes were priced at 99185 of the principal amount with an effective yieldtomaturity of 3497 net proceeds from this offering were 591 million 

 

a portion of the proceeds from these senior notes was used to repay the entire 105 million us dollar amount outstanding on the facility as of the closing date 

mortgage debt at december 31 2014 we had 1 billion in aggregate principal amount of mortgage debt outstanding that is secured by 70 healthcare facilities including redevelopment properties with a carrying value of 13 billion interest rates on the mortgage debt ranged from 044 to 841 with a weighted average effective interest rate of 616 and a weighted average maturity of three years at december 31 2014 

mortgage debt generally requires monthly principal and interest payments is collateralized by real estate assets and is generally nonrecourse mortgage debt typically restricts transfer of the encumbered assets prohibits additional liens restricts prepayment requires payment of real estate taxes requires maintenance of the assets in good condition requires maintenance of insurance on the assets and includes conditions to obtain lender consent to enter into and terminate material leases some of the mortgage debt is also crosscollateralized by multiple assets and may require tenants or operators to maintain compliance with the applicable leases or operating agreements of such real estate assets

offbalance sheet arrangements 

we own interests in certain unconsolidated joint ventures as described under note 8 to the consolidated financial statements except in limited circumstances our risk of loss is limited to our investment in the joint venture and any outstanding loans receivable in addition we have certain properties which serve as collateral for debt that is owed by a previous owner of certain of our facilities as described under note 12 to the consolidated financial statements our risk of loss for these certain properties is limited to the outstanding debt balance plus penalties if any we have no other 

 

material offbalance sheet arrangements that we expect would materially affect our liquidity and capital resources except those described below under contractual obligations  

contractual obligations 

the following table summarizes our material contractual payment obligations and commitments at december 31 2014 in thousands 

  



















inflation 

our leases often provide for either fixed increases in base rents or indexed escalators based on the consumer price index or other measures andor additional rent based on increases in the tenants’ operating revenues most of our mob leases require the tenant to pay a share of property operating costs such as real estate taxes insurance and utilities substantially all of our senior housing life science postacuteskilled nursing and hospital leases require the tenant or operator to pay all of the property operating costs or reimburse us for all such costs we believe that inflationary increases in expenses will be offset in part by the tenant or operator expense reimbursements and contractual rent increases described above 

critical accounting policies 

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” requires our management to use judgment in the application of accounting policies including making estimates and assumptions we base estimates on the best information available to us at the time our experience and on various other assumptions believed to be reasonable under the circumstances these estimates affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods if our judgment or interpretation of the facts and circumstances relating to various transactions or other matters had been different it is possible that different accounting would have been applied resulting in a different presentation of our consolidated financial statements from time to time we reevaluate our estimates and assumptions in the event estimates or assumptions prove to be different from actual results adjustments are made in subsequent periods to reflect more current estimates and assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain for a more detailed discussion of our significant accounting policies see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements below is a discussion of accounting policies that we consider critical in that they may require complex judgment in their application or require estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain 

  

 

  

principles of consolidation 

the consolidated financial statements include the accounts of hcp inc our wholly owned subsidiaries and joint ventures that we control through voting rights or other means we consolidate investments in variable interest entities “vies” when we are the primary beneficiary of the vie a variable interest holder is considered to be the primary beneficiary of a vie if it has the power to direct the activities of a variable interest entity that most significantly impact the entity’s economic performance and has the obligation to absorb losses of or the right to receive benefits from the entity that could potentially be significant to the vie 

we make judgments about which entities are vies based on an assessment of whether i the equity investors as a group if any do not have a controlling financial interest or ii the equity investment at risk is insufficient to finance that entity’s activities without additional subordinated financial support we make judgments with respect to our level of influence or control of an entity and whether we are or are not the primary beneficiary of a vie consideration of various factors includes but is not limited to our ability to direct the activities that most significantly impact the entity’s economic performance our form of ownership interest our representation on the entity’s governing body the size and seniority of our investment our ability and the rights of other investors to participate in policy making decisions replace the manager andor liquidate the entity if applicable our ability to correctly assess our influence or control over an entity when determining the primary beneficiary of a vie affects the presentation of these entities in our consolidated financial statements when we perform a reanalysis of the primary beneficiary at a date other than at inception of the variable interest entity our assumptions may be different and may result in the identification of a different primary beneficiary 

if we determine that we are the primary beneficiary of a vie our consolidated financial statements would include the operating results of the vie either tenant or borrower rather than the results of the variable interest in the vie we would require the vie to provide us timely financial information and would review the internal control of the vie to determine if we could rely on the financial information they provide if the vie has deficiencies in its internal controls over financial reporting or does not provide us with timely financial information this may adversely impact the quality andor timing of our financial reporting and our internal control over financial reporting 

revenue recognition 

at the inception of a new lease arrangement including new leases that arise from amendments we assess the terms and conditions to determine the proper lease classification a lease arrangement is classified as an operating lease if none of the following criteria are met i transfer of ownership to the lessee ii lessee has a bargain purchase option during or at the end of the lease term iii the lease term is equal to 75 or more of the underlying property’s economic life or iv the present value of   future minimum lease payments excluding executory costs are equal to 90 or more of the excess estimated fair value over retained tax credits of the leased building if one of the four criteria is met and the minimum lease payments are determined to be reasonably predicable and collectible the lease arrangement is generally accounted for as a direct financing lease if the assumptions utilized in the above classification assessments were different our lease classification for accounting purposes may have been different thus the timing and amount of our revenue recognized would have been impacted which may be material to our consolidated financial statements 

we recognize rental revenue for operating leases on a straightline basis over the lease term when collectibility of all minimum lease payments is reasonably assured and the tenant has taken possession or controls the physical use of a leased asset if the lease provides for tenant improvements we determine whether the tenant improvements are owned by the tenant or us when we are the owner of the tenant improvements the tenant is not considered to have taken physical possession or have control of the physical leased asset until the tenant improvements are substantially completed when the tenant is the owner of the tenant improvements any tenant improvement allowance funded is treated as a lease incentive and amortized as a reduction of revenue over the lease term the determination of ownership of the tenant improvements is subject to significant judgment if our assessment of the owner of the tenant improvements was different the timing and amount of our revenue recognized would be impacted 

certain leases provide for additional rents that are contingent upon a percentage of the facility’s revenue in excess of specified base amounts or other thresholds such revenue is recognized when actual results reported by the tenant or estimates of tenant results exceed the base amount or other thresholds the recognition of additional rents requires us to 

 

make estimates of amounts owed and to a certain extent are dependent on the accuracy of the facility results reported to us our estimates may differ from actual results which could be material to our consolidated financial statements 

we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts including an allowance for operating lease straightline rent receivables for estimated losses resulting from tenant defaults or the inability of tenants to make contractual rent and tenant recovery payments we monitor the liquidity and creditworthiness of our tenants and operators on a continuous basis this evaluation considers industry and economic conditions property performance credit enhancements and other factors for straightline rent amounts our assessment is based on income recoverable over the term of the lease we exercise judgment in establishing allowances and consider payment history and current credit status in developing these estimates these estimates may differ from actual results which could be material to our consolidated financial statements 

we use the direct finance method of accounting to record income from dfls for leases accounted for as dfls future minimum lease payments are recorded as a receivable for leases accounted for as dfls the net investment in the dfl represents receivables for the sum of minimum lease payments receivable and the estimated residual values of the leased properties less the unearned income unearned income is deferred and amortized to income over the lease terms to provide a constant yield when collectibility of the lease payments is reasonably assured investments in dfls are presented net of unamortized unearned income the determination of estimated useful lives and residual values are subject to significant judgment if these assessments were to change the timing and amount of our revenue recognized would be impacted 

loans receivable are classified as heldforinvestment based on management’s intent and ability to hold the loans for the foreseeable future or to maturity we recognize interest income on loans including the amortization of discounts and premiums using the interest method applied on a loanbyloan basis when collectibility of the future payments is reasonably assured premiums discounts and related costs are recognized as yield adjustments over the term of the related loans if management determined that certain loans should no longer be classified as held for maturity the timing and amount of our interest income recognized would be impacted 

loans and dfls are placed on nonaccrual status at such time as management determines that collectibility of contractual amounts is not reasonably assured while on nonaccrual status loans and dfls are either accounted for on a cash basis in which income is recognized only upon receipt of cash or on a costrecovery basis were cash receipts reduce the carrying value of the loan or dfl based on management’s judgment of collectibility 

allowances are established for loans and dfls based upon an estimate of probable losses on an individual basis if they are determined to be impaired loans and dfls are impaired when it is deemed probable that we will be unable to collect all amounts due on a timely basis in accordance with the contractual terms of the loan or lease determining the adequacy of the allowance is complex and requires significant judgment by us about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain the allowance is based upon our assessment of the borrower’s or lessee’s overall financial condition resources and payment record the prospects for support from any financially responsible guarantors and if appropriate the net realizable value of any collateral these estimates consider all available evidence including as appropriate the performance of our tenants operators or borrowers the present value of the expected future cash flows discounted at the loan’s or dfl’s effective interest rate the fair value of collateral general economic conditions and trends historical and industry loss experience and other relevant factors while our assumptions are based in part upon historical data our estimates may differ from actual results which could be material to our consolidated financial statements   

real estate 

we make estimates as part of our allocation of the purchase price of acquisitions to the various components of the acquisition based upon the relative fair value of each component the most significant components of our allocations are typically the allocation of fair value to the buildings asifvacant land and inplace leases in the case of the fair value of buildings and the allocation of value to land and other intangibles our estimates of the values of these components will affect the amount of depreciation and amortization we record over the estimated useful life of the property acquired or the remaining lease term in the case of the value of inplace leases we make our best estimates based on our evaluation of the specific characteristics of each tenant’s lease factors considered include estimates of carrying costs during hypothetical expected leaseup periods market conditions and costs to execute similar leases our assumptions affect the amount of future revenue that we will recognize over the remaining lease term for the acquired inplace leases 

 

a variety of costs are incurred in the development and leasing of properties after determination is made to capitalize a cost it is allocated to the specific component of a project that is benefited determination of when a development project is substantially complete and capitalization must cease involves a degree of judgment the costs of land and buildings under development include specifically identifiable costs the capitalized costs include preconstruction costs essential to the development of the property development costs construction costs interest costs real estate taxes and other costs incurred during the period of development we consider a construction project as substantially completed and available for occupancy and cease capitalization of costs upon the completion of the related tenant improvements 

impairment of longlived assets and goodwill 

we assess the carrying value of our real estate assets and related intangibles “real estate assets” when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the real estate assets may not be recoverable recoverability of real estate assets is measured by comparing the carrying amount of the real estate assets to the respective estimated future undiscounted cash flows the estimated future undiscounted cash flows are calculated utilizing the lowest level of identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities in order to review our real estate assets for recoverability we consider market conditions as well as our intent with respect to holding or disposing of the asset if our analysis indicates that the carrying value of the real estate assets is not recoverable on an undiscounted cash flow basis we recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the real estate asset 

goodwill is tested for impairment at least annually based on certain qualitative factors to determine if it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount potential impairment indicators and qualitative factors include a significant decline in real estate valuations restructuring plans current macroeconomic conditions state of the equity and capital markets or a significant decline in the value of our market capitalization if we determine that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount we apply the required twostep quantitative approach the quantitative procedures of the twostep approach i compare the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount including goodwill and if necessary ii compare the implied fair value of reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill as if it had been acquired in a business combination at the date of the impairment test the excess fair value of the reporting unit over the fair value of assets and liabilities is the implied value of goodwill and is used to determine the amount of impairment if any we estimate the fair value of the assets and liabilities in the reporting unit through various valuation techniques including applying capitalization rates to segment net operating income quoted market values and thirdparty appraisals as necessary the fair value of the reporting unit may also include an allocation of an enterprise value premium that we estimate a third party would be willing to pay for the company 

the determination of the fair value of real estate assets and goodwill involves significant judgment this judgment is based on our analysis and estimates of fair value of real estate assets and reporting units future operating results and resulting cash flows of each real estate asset whose carrying amount may not be recoverable our ability to accurately predict future operating results resulting cash flows and estimate and allocate fair values impacts the timing and recognition of impairments while we believe our assumptions are reasonable changes in these assumptions may have a material impact on our financial results 

investments in unconsolidated joint ventures 

the initial carrying value of investments in unconsolidated joint ventures is based on the amount paid to purchase the joint venture interest or the carrying value of the assets prior to the sale or contribution of the interests to the joint venture we evaluate our equity method investments for impairment indicators based upon a comparison of the fair value of the equity method investment to our carrying value if we determine there is a decline in the fair value of our investment in an unconsolidated joint venture below its carrying value and it is otherthantemporary an impairment is recorded the determination of the fair value and as to whether a deficiency in fair value is “otherthantemporary” of investments in unconsolidated joint ventures involves significant judgment our estimates consider all available evidence including as appropriate the present value of the expected future cash flows discounted at market rates general economic conditions and trends severity and duration of the fair value deficiency and other relevant factors capitalization rates discount rates and credit spreads utilized in our valuation models are based upon rates that we believe to be within a reasonable range of current market rates for the respective investments while we believe our assumptions are reasonable changes in these assumptions may have a material impact on our financial results 

 

  

  

income taxes 

as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements significant management judgment is required to evaluate our compliance with reit requirements our determinations are based on interpretation of tax laws and our conclusions may have an impact on the income tax expense recognized adjustments to income tax expense may be required as a result of i audits conducted by federal state and local tax authorities ii our ability to qualify as a reit iii the potential for builtin gain recognition and iv changes in tax laws adjustments required in any given period are included within the income tax provision 

recent accounting pronouncements 

see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for the impact of new accounting standards there were no accounting pronouncements that were issued but not yet adopted by us that we believe will materially impact our consolidated financial statements 




 item 7 a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we use derivative financial instruments in the normal course of business to mitigate interest rate and foreign currency risk we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes derivatives are recorded on the consolidated balance sheets at their fair value see note 24 to the consolidated financial statements 

to illustrate the effect of movements in the interest rate and foreign currency markets we performed a market sensitivity analysis on our hedging instruments we applied various basis point spreads to the underlying interest rate curves and foreign currency exchange rates of the derivative portfolio in order to determine the instruments’ change in fair value assuming a one percentage point change in the underlying interest rate curve and foreign currency exchange rates the estimated change in fair value of each of the underlying derivative instruments would not exceed 4 million see note 24 to the consolidated financial statements for additional analysis details 

interest rate risk 

at december 31 2014 we are exposed to market risks related to fluctuations in interest rates primarily on variable rate investments which have been predominately hedged through interest rate swap contracts 

interest rate fluctuations will generally not affect our future earnings or cash flows on our fixed rate debt and assets unless such instruments mature or are otherwise terminated however interest rate changes will affect the fair value of our fixed rate instruments conversely  changes in interest rates on variable rate debt and investments would change our future earnings and cash flows but not significantly affect the fair value of those instruments assuming a one percentage point increase in the interest rate related to the variablerate investments and variablerate debt and assuming no other changes in the outstanding balance as of december 31 2014 our annual interest expense would increase by approximately 9 million or 002 per common share on a diluted basis 

  

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

at december 31 2014 our exposure to foreign currencies primarily relates to uk investments in leased real estate loan investments senior unsecured notes and the related gbp denominated cash flows from such investments our foreign currency exposure is partially mitigated through the use of gbp denominated borrowings and foreign currency swap contracts 

  

market risk 

we have investments in marketable debt securities classified as heldtomaturity because we have the positive intent and ability to hold the securities to maturity heldtomaturity securities are recorded at amortized cost and adjusted for the amortization of premiums and discounts through maturity we consider a variety of factors in evaluating an otherthantemporary decline in value such as the length of time and the extent to which the market value has been less than our 

 

current adjusted carrying value the issuer’s financial condition capital strength and nearterm prospects any recent events specific to that issuer and economic conditions of its industry and our investment horizon in relationship to an anticipated nearterm recovery in the market value if any at december 31 2014 the fair value and carrying value of marketable debt securities were 252 million and 231 million respectively 

the principal amount and the average interest rates for our loans receivable and debt categorized by maturity dates is presented in the table below the fair value for our senior unsecured notes payable is based on prevailing market prices the fair value estimates for loans receivable and mortgage debt payable are based on discounting future cash flows utilizing current rates for loans and debt of the same type and remaining maturity

hcp an sp 500 company invests primarily in real estate serving the healthcare industry in the united states we are a maryland corporation organized in 1985 to qualify as a selfadministered real estate investment trust reit we are headquartered in long beach california with offices in nashville tennessee and san francisco california we acquire develop lease manage and dispose of healthcare real estate and provide financing to healthcare providers our portfolio is comprised of investments in the following five healthcare segments i senior housing ii postacuteskilled nursing iii life science iv medical office and v hospital we make investments in our healthcare segments using the following five investment products i properties under lease ii debt investments iii developments and redevelopments iv investment management and v investments in senior housing operations utilizing the structure permitted by the housing and economic recovery act of 2008 which is commonly referred to as ridea 

the delivery of healthcare services requires real estate and as a result tenants and operators depend on real estate in part to maintain and grow their businesses we believe that the healthcare real estate market provides investment opportunities due to the following 

• compelling demographics driving the demand for healthcare services • specialized nature of healthcare real estate investing and • ongoing consolidation of a fragmented healthcare real estate sector our website address is wwwhcpicom  our annual reports on form 10k quarterly reports on form 10q current reports on form 8k and any amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to section 13a or 15d of the securities exchange act of 1934 the exchange act are available on our website free of charge as soon as reasonably practicable after we electronically file such materials with or furnish them to the united states us securities and exchange commission sec 

healthcare industry 

healthcare is the single largest industry in the us based on gross domestic product gdp according to the national health expenditures report by the centers for medicare and medicaid services cms i national health expenditures are projected to grow 61 in 2014 and 58 in 2015 ii the average compounded annual growth rate for national health expenditures over the projection period of 2015 through 2022 is anticipated to be 62 and iii the healthcare industry is projected to represent 183 of us gdp in 2014

business strategy 

our primary goal is to increase stockholder value through profitable growth which allows us to maintain or increase dividends per share to our stockholders our investment strategy to achieve this goal is based on three principles i opportunistic investing ii portfolio diversification and iii conservative financing 

opportunistic investing 

we make investment decisions that are expected to drive profitable growth and create stockholder value we position ourselves to create and take advantage of opportunities that will allow us to meet our goals and investment criteria 

portfolio diversification 

we believe in maintaining a portfolio of healthcare investments diversified by segment geography operator tenant and investment product we monitor but do not limit our investments based on the percentage of our total assets that may be invested in any one property type investment product or geographic location the number of properties that may be leased to a single operator or tenant or loans that may be made to a single borrower with investments in multiple segments and investment products we can focus on opportunities with the most attractive riskreward profile for the portfolio as a whole we may structure transactions as master leases require operator or tenant insurance and indemnifications obtain credit enhancements in the form of guarantees letters of credit or security deposits and take other measures to mitigate risk 

conservative financing 

we believe a conservative balance sheet is important to our ability to execute our opportunistic investing approach we maintain a conservative balance sheet by actively managing our debttoequity levels and maintaining multiple sources of liquidity such as our revolving line of credit facility the facility access to capital markets and secured debt lenders relationships with current and prospective institutional joint venture partners and our ability to divest of assets our debt obligations are primarily fixed rate with staggered maturities which reduces the impact of rising interest rates on our operations 

we finance our investments based on our evaluation of available sources of funding for shortterm purposes we may utilize the facility or arrange for other shortterm borrowings from banks or other sources we arrange for longerterm financing by offering equity and debt securities placing mortgage debt and obtaining capital from institutional lenders 

we specifically incorporate by reference into this section the information set forth in item 7 2013 transaction overview of this report 

competition 

investing in real estate serving the healthcare industry is highly competitive we face competition from other reits investment companies pension funds private equity and hedge fund investors sovereign funds healthcare operators lenders developers and other institutional investors some of whom may have greater resources and lower costs of capital than we do increased competition makes it more challenging for us to identify and successfully capitalize on opportunities that meet our objectives our ability to compete may also be impacted by national and local economic trends availability of investment alternatives availability and cost of capital construction and renovation costs existing laws and regulations new legislation and population trends 

income from our facilities is dependent on the ability of our operators and tenants to compete with other companies on a number of different levels including the quality of care provided reputation the physical appearance of a facility price and range of services offered alternatives for healthcare delivery the supply of competing properties physicians staff referral sources location the size and demographics of the population in surrounding areas and the financial condition of our tenants and operators private federal and state payment programs as well as the effect of laws and regulations may also have a significant influence on the profitability of our tenants and operators for a discussion of the risks associated with competitive conditions affecting our business see risk factors in item 1a 

healthcare segments 

senior housing at december 31 2013 we had interests in 444 senior housing facilities 20 of which are in a ridea structure excluding ridea properties all of our senior housing facilities are triplenet leased to single tenants senior housing facilities include assisted living facilities alfs independent living facilities ilfs and continuing care retirement communities ccrcs which cater to different segments of the elderly population based upon their personal needs services provided by our operators or tenants in these facilities are primarily paid for by the residents directly or through private insurance and are less reliant on government reimbursement programs such as medicaid and medicare our senior housing property types are further described below 

• assisted living facilities alfs are licensed care facilities that provide personal care services support and housing for those who need help with activities of daily living adl such as bathing eating and dressing yet require limited medical care the programs and services may include transportation social activities exercise and fitness programs beauty or barber shop 5

• independent living facilities ilfs are designed to meet the needs of seniors who choose to live in an environment surrounded by their peers with services such as housekeeping meals and activities these residents generally do not need assistance with adl however in some of our facilities residents have the option to contract for these services at december 31 2013 we had interests in 64 ilfs • continuing care retirement communities ccrcs provide housing and healthrelated services under longterm contracts this alternative is appealing to residents as it eliminates the need for relocating when health and medical needs change thus allowing residents to age in place some ccrcs require a substantial entry or buyin fee and most also charge monthly maintenance fees in exchange for a living unit meals and some health services ccrcs typically require the individual to be in relatively good health and independent upon entry at december 31 2013 we had interests in 14 ccrcs our senior housing segment accounted for approximately 36 33 and 30 of total revenues for the years ended december 31 2013 2012 and 2011 respectively the following table provides information about our senior housing operator concentration for the year ended december 31 2013

our postacuteskilled nursing segment accounted for approximately 29 of total revenues for each of the years ended december 31 2013 2012 and 2011 during the year ended december 31 2013 hcr manorcare as our tenantoperator contributed 83 of our postacuteskilled nursing segment revenues 

life science at december 31 2013 we had interests in 115 life science properties including four facilities owned by our investment management platform these properties contain laboratory and office space primarily for biotechnology medical device and pharmaceutical companies scientific research institutions government agencies and other organizations involved in the life science industry while these properties contain similar characteristics to commercial office buildings they generally contain more advanced electrical mechanical and heating ventilating and air conditioning hvac systems the facilities generally have specialty equipment including emergency generators fume hoods lab bench tops and related amenities in many instances life science tenants make significant investments to improve their leased space in addition to landlord improvements to accommodate biology chemistry or medical device research initiatives life science properties are primarily configured in business park or campus settings and include multiple buildings the business park and campus settings allow us the opportunity to provide flexible contiguousadjacent expansion to accommodate the growth of existing tenants our properties are located in wellestablished geographical markets known for scientific research including san francisco san diego and salt lake city at december 31 2013 96 of our life science properties were triplenet leased based on leased square feet 

our life science segment accounted for approximately 14 15 and 17 of total revenues for the years ended december 31 2013 2012 and 2011 respectively the following table provides information about our life science tenant concentration for the year ended december 31 2013

1 percentage of total revenues from hca includes revenues earned from both our medical office and hospital segments investment products 

properties under lease we primarily generate revenue from properties under longterm leases most of our rents and other earned income from leases are received under triplenet leases or leases that provide for a substantial recovery of property operating expenses such as real estate taxes repairs and maintenance property management fees utilities and insurance however some of our mob and life science facility rents are structured under gross or modified gross leases accordingly for such gross or modified gross leases we incur the property operating expenses 

our ability to grow income from leased properties depends in part on our ability to i increase rental income and other earned income by increasing rental rates and occupancy levels ii maximize tenant recoveries and iii control nonrecoverable operating expenses most of our leases include contractual annual base rent escalation clauses that are either predetermined fixed increases or are a function of an inflation index which may include minimum andor maximum percentage increases 

debt investments our mezzanine loans are generally secured by a pledge of ownership interests of an entity or entities which directly or indirectly own properties and are subordinate to other debt including mortgages and other mezzanine loans our mortgage and construction loans are typically made to healthcare providers and healthcare real estate generally secures these loans 

developments and redevelopments we generally commit to development projects that are at least 50 preleased or when we believe that market conditions will support speculative construction we work closely with our local real estate service providers including brokerage property management project management and construction management companies to assist us in evaluating development proposals and completing developments our development and redevelopment investments are primarily in our life science and medical office segments redevelopments are properties that require significant capital expenditures generally more than 25 of acquisition cost or existing basis to renovate achieve stabilization or to change the primary use of the property 

investment management we coinvest in real estate properties with institutional investors through joint ventures structured as partnerships or limited liability companies we target institutional investors with longterm investment horizons who seek to benefit from our expertise in healthcare real estate predominantly we retain noncontrolling interests in the joint ventures ranging from 20 to 30 and serve as the managing member these ventures generally allow us to earn acquisition and asset management fees and have the potential for promoted interests or incentive distributions based on performance of the joint venture

government regulation licensing and enforcement 

overview 

our tenants and operators are typically subject to extensive and complex federal state and local healthcare laws and regulations relating to fraud and abuse practices government reimbursement licensure and certificate of need and similar laws governing the operation of healthcare facilities and we expect that the healthcare industry in general will continue to face increased regulation and pressure in the areas of fraud waste and abuse cost control healthcare management and provision of services among others these regulations are wideranging and can subject our tenants and operators to civil criminal and administrative sanctions affected tenants and operators may find it increasingly difficult to comply with this complex and evolving regulatory environment because of a relative lack of guidance in many areas as certain of our healthcare properties are subject to oversight from several government agencies and the laws may vary from one jurisdiction to another changes in laws and regulations and reimbursement enforcement activity and regulatory noncompliance by our tenants and operators can all have a significant effect on their operations and financial condition which in turn may adversely impact us as detailed below and set forth under risk factors in item 1a 

based on information primarily provided by our tenants and operators excluding our medical office segment at december 31 2013 we estimate that approximately 17 and 14 of the annualized base rental payments received from our tenants and operators were dependent on medicare and medicaid reimbursement respectively 

the following is a discussion of certain laws and regulations generally applicable to our operators and in certain cases to us 

fraud and abuse enforcement 

there are various extremely complex federal and state laws and regulations governing healthcare providers relationships and arrangements and prohibiting fraudulent and abusive practices by such providers these laws include i federal and state false claims acts which among other things prohibit providers from filing false claims or making false statements to receive payment from medicare medicaid or other federal or state healthcare programs ii federal and state antikickback and 

feesplitting statutes including the medicare and medicaid antikickback statute which prohibit the payment or receipt of remuneration to induce referrals or recommendations of healthcare items or services iii federal and state physician selfreferral laws commonly referred to as the stark law which generally prohibit referrals by physicians to entities with which the physician or an immediate family member has a financial relationship iv the federal civil monetary penalties law which prohibits among other things the knowing presentation of a false or fraudulent claim for certain healthcare services and v federal and state privacy laws including the privacy and security rules contained in the health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 which provide for the privacy and security of personal health information violations of healthcare fraud and abuse laws carry civil criminal and administrative sanctions including punitive sanctions monetary penalties imprisonment denial of medicare and medicaid reimbursement and potential exclusion from medicare medicaid or other federal or state healthcare programs these laws are enforced by a variety of federal state and local agencies and can also be enforced by private litigants through among other things federal and state false claims acts which allow private litigants to bring qui tam or whistleblower actions many of our operators and tenants are subject to these laws and may become the subject of governmental enforcement actions if they fail to comply with applicable laws 

reimbursement 

sources of revenue for many of our tenants and operators include among others governmental healthcare programs such as the federal medicare program and state medicaid programs and nongovernmental payors such as insurance carriers and hmos as federal and state governments focus on healthcare reform initiatives and as the federal government and many states face significant budget deficits efforts to reduce costs by these payors will likely continue which may result in reduced or slower growth in reimbursement for certain services provided by some of our tenants and operators 

healthcare licensure and certificate of need 

certain healthcare facilities in our portfolio are subject to extensive federal state and local licensure certification and inspection laws and regulations in addition various licenses and permits are required to dispense narcotics operate pharmacies handle radioactive materials and operate equipment many states require certain healthcare providers to obtain a certificate of need which requires prior approval for the construction expansion and closure of certain healthcare facilities the approval process related to state certificate of need laws may impact some of our tenants and operators abilities to expand or change their businesses 

life science facilities 

while certain of our life science tenants include some wellestablished companies other such tenants are less established and in some cases may not yet have a product approved by the food and drug administration or other regulatory authorities for commercial sale creating a new pharmaceutical product or medical device requires substantial investments of time and money in part because of the extensive regulation of the healthcare industry it also entails considerable risk of failure in demonstrating that the product is safe and effective and in gaining regulatory approval and market acceptance 

senior housing entrance fee communities 

certain of our senior housing facilities are operated as entrance fee communities generally an entrance fee is an upfront fee or consideration paid by a resident a portion of which may be refundable in exchange for some form of longterm benefit some of the entrance fee communities are subject to significant state regulatory oversight including for example oversight of each facilitys financial condition establishment and monitoring of reserve requirements and other financial restrictions the right of residents to cancel their contracts within a specified period of time lien rights in favor of the residents restrictions on change of ownership and similar matters 

americans with disabilities act the ada 

our properties must comply with the ada and any similar state or local laws to the extent that such properties are public accommodations as defined in those statutes the ada may require removal of barriers to access by persons with disabilities in certain public areas of our properties where such removal is readily achievable to date we have not received any notices of noncompliance with the ada that have caused us to incur substantial capital expenditures to address ada concerns should barriers to access by persons with disabilities be discovered at any of our properties we may be directly or indirectly responsible for additional costs that may be required to make facilities adacompliant noncompliance with the ada could result in the imposition of fines or an award of damages to private litigants the obligation to make readily achievable accommodations pursuant to the ada is an ongoing one and we continue to assess our properties and make modifications as appropriate in this respect 

environmental matters 

a wide variety of federal state and local environmental and occupational health and safety laws and regulations affect healthcare facility operations these complex federal and state statutes and their enforcement involve a myriad of regulations many of which involve strict liability on the part of the potential offender some of these federal and state statutes may directly impact us under various federal state and local environmental laws ordinances and regulations an owner of real property or a secured lender such as us may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of hazardous or toxic substances at under or disposed of in connection with such property as well as other potential costs relating to hazardous or toxic substances including government fines and damages for injuries to persons and adjacent property the cost of any required remediation removal fines or personal or property damages and the owners or secured lenders liability therefore could exceed or impair the value of the property andor the assets of the owner or secured lender in addition the presence of such substances or the failure to properly dispose of or remediate such substances may adversely affect the owners ability to sell or rent such property or to borrow using such property as collateral which in turn could reduce our earnings for a description of the risks associated with environmental matters see risk factors in item 1a of this report 




 item 1a risk factors 

  the section below discusses the most significant risk factors that may materially adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

as set forth below we believe that the risks facing our company generally fall into the following categories 

• risks related to our business and • risks related to tax matters including reitrelated risks risks related to our business 

volatility disruption or uncertainty in the financial markets may impair our ability to raise capital obtain new financing or refinance existing obligations and fund real estate and development activities 

the global financial markets have experienced pervasive and fundamental disruptions while these conditions have stabilized since the first quarter of 2009 and the capital markets continue to show signs of improvement the strength and sustainability of an economic recovery is uncertain additional levels of market disruption volatility or uncertainty could materially adversely impact our ability to raise capital obtain new financing or refinance our existing obligations as they mature and fund real estate and development activities 

market volatility could also lead to significant uncertainty in the valuation of our investments and those of our joint ventures which may result in a substantial decrease in the value of our properties and those of our joint ventures as a result we may not be able to recover the carrying amount of such investments and the associated goodwill if any which may require us to recognize impairment charges in earnings 

we rely on external sources of capital to fund future capital needs and limitations on our access to such capital could have a materially adverse effect on our ability to meet commitments as they become due or make future investments necessary to grow our business 

we may not be able to fund all future capital needs from cash retained from operations if we are unable to obtain enough internal capital we may need to rely on external sources of capital including debt and equity financing to fulfill our capital requirements if we cannot access these external sources of capital we may not be able to make the investments needed to grow our business and to meet our obligations and commitments as they mature our access to capital depends upon a number of factors some of which we have little or no control over including but not limited to 

• general availability of credit and market conditions including rising interest rates and increased borrowing cost • the market price of the shares of our equity securities and the credit ratings of our debt and preferred securities • the markets perception of our growth potential and our current and potential future earnings and cash distributions • our degree of financial leverage and operational flexibility • the financial integrity of our lenders which might impair their ability to meet their commitments to us or their willingness to make additional loans to us and our inability to replace the financing commitment of any such lender on favorable terms or at all • the stability of the market value of our properties • the financial performance and general market perception of our operators tenants and borrowers • changes in the credit ratings on us government debt securities or default or delay in payment by the united states of its obligations and • issues facing the healthcare industry including but not limited to healthcare reform and changes in government reimbursement policies if our access to capital is limited by these factors or other factors it could have a material adverse impact on our ability to fund operations refinance our debt obligations fund dividend payments acquire properties and development activities 

adverse changes in our credit ratings could impair our ability to obtain additional debt and equity financing on favorable terms if at all and negatively impact the market price of our securities including our common stock 

the credit ratings of our senior unsecured debt are based on our operating performance liquidity and leverage ratios overall financial position and other factors employed by the credit rating agencies in their rating analyses of us our credit ratings can affect the amount and type of capital we can access as well as the terms of any financings we may obtain there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain our current credit ratings and in the event that our current credit ratings deteriorate we would likely incur higher borrowing costs and it may be more difficult or expensive to obtain 

additional financing or refinance existing obligations and commitments also a downgrade in our credit ratings would trigger additional costs or other potentially negative consequences under our current and future credit facilities and debt instruments 

our level of indebtedness may increase and materially adversely affect our future operations 

our outstanding indebtedness as of december 31 2013 was approximately 87 billion we may incur additional indebtedness in the future including in connection with the development or acquisition of assets which may be substantial any significant additional indebtedness could negatively affect the credit ratings of our debt and require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow to interest and principal payments due on our indebtedness greater demands on our cash resources may reduce funds available to us to pay dividends conduct development activities make capital expenditures and acquisitions or carry out other aspects of our business strategy increased indebtedness can also limit our ability to adjust rapidly to changing market conditions make us more vulnerable to general adverse economic and industry conditions and create competitive disadvantages for us compared to other companies with relatively lower debt levels increased future debt service obligations may limit our operational flexibility including our ability to finance or refinance our properties contribute properties to joint ventures or sell properties as needed 

covenants related to our indebtedness limit our operational flexibility and breaches of these covenants could materially adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

our unsecured credit facilities unsecured debt securities and secured debt and other indebtedness that we may incur in the future require or will require us to comply with a number of customary financial and other covenants such as maintaining certain levels of debt service coverage and leverage ratio tangible net worth requirements and maintaining reit status our continued ability to incur additional debt and to conduct business in general is subject to compliance with these financial and other covenants which limit our operational flexibility for example mortgages on our properties contain customary covenants such as those that limit or restrict our ability without the consent of the lender to further encumber or sell the applicable properties or to replace the applicable tenant or operator breaches of certain covenants may result in defaults under the mortgages on our properties and crossdefaults under certain of our other indebtedness even if we satisfy our payment obligations to the respective obligee additionally defaults under the leases or operating agreements related to mortgaged properties including defaults associated with the bankruptcy of the applicable tenant or operator may result in a default under the underlying mortgage and crossdefaults under certain of our other indebtedness covenants that limit our operational flexibility as well as defaults under our debt instruments could materially adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

an increase in interest rates could increase interest cost on new debt and could materially adversely impact our ability to refinance existing debt sell assets and limit our acquisition investment and development activities 

if interest rates increase so could our interest costs for any new debt this increased cost could make the financing of any acquisition and development activity more costly rising interest rates could limit our ability to refinance existing debt when it matures or cause us to pay higher interest rates upon refinancing and increase interest expense on refinanced indebtedness in addition an increase in interest rates could decrease the amount third parties are willing to pay for our assets thereby limiting our ability to reposition our portfolio promptly in response to changes in economic or other conditions 

we manage a portion of our exposure to interest rate risk by accessing debt with staggered maturities and through the use of derivative instruments primarily interest rate swap agreements however no amount of hedging activity can fully insulate us from the risks associated with changes in interest rates swap agreements involve risk including that counterparties may fail to honor their 

obligations under these arrangements that these arrangements may not be effective in reducing our exposure to interest rate changes that the amount of income we earn from hedging transactions may be limited by federal tax provisions governing reits and that these arrangements may cause us to pay higher interest rates on our debt obligations than would otherwise be the case failure to hedge effectively against interest rate risk if we choose to engage in such activities could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

we may be adversely affected by fluctuations in currency exchange rates 

we continue to pursue growth opportunities in international markets where the us dollar is not the denominated currency the ownership of investments located outside of the united states subjects us to risk from fluctuations in exchange rates between foreign currencies and the us dollar a significant change in the value of the foreign currency of one or more countries where we have a significant investment may have a material adverse effect on our financial position debt covenant ratios results of operations and cash flow 

we may attempt to manage the impact of foreign currency exchange rate changes through the use of derivative contracts or other methods for example we have a £137 million gbp investment 227 million at december 31 2013 and maintain a £137 million unsecured gbp term loan as a natural hedge additionally we executed a currency swap contract to hedge the risk related to a portion of the forecasted interest receipts on this investment however no amount of hedging activity can fully insulate us from the risks associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates and the failure to hedge effectively against foreign currency exchange rate risk if we choose to engage in such activities could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

we depend on a limited number of operators and tenants that account for a large percentage of our revenues 

during the year ended december 31 2013 approximately 50 of our revenues were generated by our leasing or financial arrangements with the following four companies hcr manorcare 28 emeritus 13 sunrise 5 and brookdale 4 the failure inability or unwillingness of these operators or tenants to meet their obligations to us could materially reduce our cash flow as well as our results of operations which could in turn reduce the amount of dividends we pay cause our stock price to decline and have other material adverse effects on our business results of operations and financial condition 

in addition any failure by these operators or tenants to effectively conduct their operations or to maintain and improve our properties could adversely affect their business reputation and their ability to attract and retain patients and residents in our properties which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition these operators and tenants generally have also agreed to indemnify defend and hold us harmless from and against various claims litigation and liabilities arising in connection with their respective businesses and we cannot provide any assurance that they will have sufficient assets income access to financing and insurance coverage to enable it to satisfy its indemnification obligations 

economic and other conditions that negatively affect geographic areas to which a greater percentage of our revenue is attributed could materially adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

for the year ended december 31 2013 approximately 41 of our revenue was derived from properties located in california 21 texas 11 and florida 9 as a result we are subject to increased exposure to adverse conditions affecting these regions including downturns in the local 

economies or changes in local real estate conditions increased competition or decreased demand and changes in statespecific legislation which could adversely affect our business and results of operations 

the bankruptcy insolvency or financial deterioration of one or more of our major operators or tenants may materially adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

we lease our properties directly to operators in most cases and in certain other cases we lease to thirdparty tenants who enter into longterm management agreements with operators to manage the properties although our leases financing arrangements and other agreements with our tenants and operators generally provide us the right under specified circumstances to terminate a lease evict an operator or tenant or demand immediate repayment of certain obligations to us the bankruptcy and insolvency laws afford certain rights to a party that has filed for bankruptcy or reorganization that may render certain of these remedies unenforceable or at the least delay our ability to pursue such remedies for example we cannot evict a tenant or operator solely because of its bankruptcy filing a debtor has the right to assume or to assume and assign to a third party or to reject its unexpired contracts in a bankruptcy proceeding if a debtor were to reject its leases with us our claim against the debtor for unpaid and future rents would be limited by the statutory cap set forth in the us bankruptcy code which may be substantially less than the remaining rent actually owed under the lease in addition the inability of our tenants or operators to make payments or comply with certain other lease obligations may affect our compliance with certain covenants contained in our debt securities credit facilities and the mortgages on the properties leased or managed by such tenants and operators in addition under certain conditions defaults under the underlying mortgages may result in crossdefault under our other indebtedness although we believe that we would be able to secure amendments under the applicable agreements in those circumstances the bankruptcy of an applicable operator or tenant may potentially result in less favorable borrowing terms than currently available delays in the availability of funding or other material adverse consequences in addition many of our facilities are leased to healthcare providers who provide longterm custodial care to the elderly evicting such operators for failure to pay rent while the facility is occupied may be a difficult and slow process and may not be successful 

our operators and tenants may not procure the necessary insurance to adequately insure against losses 

our leases generally require our tenants and operators to secure and maintain comprehensive liability and property insurance that covers us as well as the tenants and operators certain losses may not be adequately insured by our tenants and operators should an uninsured loss or a loss in excess of insured limits occur we could incur liability or lose all or a portion of the capital we have invested in a property as well as the anticipated future revenues from the property in such an event we might nevertheless remain obligated for any mortgage debt or other financial obligations related to the property we continually review the insurance maintained by our tenants and operators and believe the coverage provided to be customary for similarly situated companies in our industry however we cannot provide any assurances that we will continue to require the same level of insurance coverage of our tenants and operators or that such insurance will be available at a reasonable cost in the future also we cannot assure you that material uninsured losses or losses in excess of insurance proceeds will not occur in the future 

our operators and tenants are faced with litigation and may experience rising liability and insurance costs 

in some states advocacy groups have been created to monitor the quality of care at healthcare facilities and these groups have brought litigation against the operators and tenants of such facilities also in several instances private litigation by patients has succeeded in winning large damage awards for alleged abuses the effect of this litigation and other potential litigation may materially increase the costs incurred by our operators and tenants for monitoring and reporting quality of care compliance in 

addition their cost of liability and medical malpractice insurance can be significant and may increase or even not be available at a reasonable cost so long as the present healthcare litigation environment continues cost increases could cause our operators to be unable to make their lease or mortgage payments or fail to purchase the appropriate liability and malpractice insurance potentially decreasing our revenues and increasing our collection and litigation costs in addition as a result of our ownership of healthcare facilities we may be named as a defendant in lawsuits allegedly arising from the actions of our operators or tenants for which claims such operators and tenants have agreed to indemnify defend and hold us harmless from and against but which may require unanticipated expenditures on our part 

operators and tenants that fail to comply with the requirements of or changes to governmental reimbursement programs such as medicare or medicaid may cease to operate or be unable to meet their financial and other contractual obligations to us 

certain of our operators and tenants are affected by an extremely complex set of federal state and local laws and regulations that are subject to frequent and substantial changes sometimes applied retroactively resulting from legislation adoption of rules and regulations and administrative and judicial interpretations of existing law see item 1—business—government regulation licensing and enforcement above for example to the extent that any of our operators or tenants receive a significant portion of their revenues from governmental payors primarily medicare and medicaid such revenues may be subject to 

• statutory and regulatory changes • retroactive rate adjustments • recovery of program overpayments or setoffs • administrative rulings • policy interpretations • payment or other delays by fiscal intermediaries or carriers • government funding restrictions at a program level or with respect to specific facilities and • interruption or delays in payments due to any ongoing governmental investigations and audits at such property in recent years governmental payors have frozen or reduced payments to healthcare providers due to budgetary pressures healthcare reimbursement will likely continue to be of significant importance to federal and state authorities we cannot make any assessment as to the ultimate timing or the effect that any future legislative reforms may have on our operators and tenants costs of doing business and on the amount of reimbursement by government and other thirdparty payors the failure of any of our operators or tenants to comply with these laws requirements and regulations could materially adversely affect their ability to meet their financial and contractual obligations to us 

legislation to address federal government operations and administration decisions affecting the centers for medicare and medicaid services could have a material adverse effect on our operators liquidity financial condition or results of operations 

enactment of the consolidated appropriations act of 2014 and congressional consideration of legislation pertaining to the federal debt ceiling the affordable care act tax reform and entitlement programs including reimbursement rates for physicians could have a material adverse effect on our operators liquidity financial condition or results of operations in particular funding for entitlement programs such as medicare and medicaid may result in increased costs and fees for programs such as 

medicare advantage plans and reductions in reimbursements to providers congressional action related to the federal debt ceiling may have an impact on credit markets tax reform may impact corporate and individual tax rates as well as impact retirement plans additionally amendments to the patient protection and affordable care act along with the health care and education reconciliation act of 2010 collectively the affordable care act implementation of the affordable care act by the administration and decisions by the centers for medicare and medicaid services could impact the delivery of services and benefits under medicare medicaid or medicare advantage plans such changes could have a material adverse effect on our operators liquidity financial condition or results of operations which could adversely affect their ability to satisfy their obligations to us and could have a material adverse effect on us 

operators and tenants that fail to comply with federal state and local licensure certification and inspection laws and regulations may cease to operate or be unable to meet their financial and other contractual obligations to us 

certain of our operators and tenants are subject to extensive federal state local and industryrelated licensure certification and inspection laws regulations and standards our operators or tenants failure to comply with any of these laws regulations or standards could result in loss of accreditation denial of reimbursement imposition of fines suspension or decertification from federal and state healthcare programs loss of license or closure of the facility andor the incurrence of considerable costs arising from an investigation or regulatory action for example certain of our properties may require a license registration andor certificate of need to operate failure of any operator or tenant to obtain a license registration or certificate of need or loss of a required license registration or certificate of need would prevent a facility from operating in the manner intended by such operator or tenant additionally failure of our operators and tenants to generally comply with applicable laws and regulations may have an adverse effect on facilities owned by or mortgaged to us and therefore may materially adversely impact us see item 1—business—government regulation licensing and enforcement—healthcare licensure and certificate of need above 

increased competition as well as an inability to grow revenues as originally forecast has resulted and may further result in lower net revenues for some of our operators and tenants and may affect their ability to meet their financial and other contractual obligations to us 

the healthcare industry is highly competitive and can become more competitive in the future the occupancy levels at and rental income from our facilities is dependent on our ability and the ability of our operators and tenants to maintain and increase such levels and income and to compete with entities that have substantial capital resources these entities compete with other operators and tenants on a number of different levels including the quality of care provided reputation the physical appearance of a facility price the range of services offered family preference alternatives for healthcare delivery the supply of competing properties physicians staff referral sources location and the size and demographics of the population in the surrounding area private federal and state payment programs and the effect of laws and regulations may also have a significant influence on the profitability of the properties and their tenants our operators and tenants also compete with numerous other companies providing similar healthcare services or alternatives such as home health agencies life care at home communitybased service programs retirement communities and convalescent centers such competition which is due in part to historical overdevelopment in some segments in which we invest has caused the occupancy rate of newly constructed buildings to slow and the monthly rate that many newly built and previously existing facilities were able to obtain for their services to decrease we cannot be certain that the operators and tenants of all of our facilities will be able to achieve occupancy and rate levels that will enable them to meet all of their obligations to us further many competing companies may have resources and attributes that are superior to those of our operators and tenants thus our operators and tenants may encounter increased competition in the future that could 

limit their ability to maintain or attract residents or expand their businesses which could materially adversely affect their ability to meet their financial and other contractual obligations to us potentially decreasing our revenues impairing our assets and increasing our collection and dispute costs 

our tenants in the life science industry face high levels of regulation expense and uncertainty 

life science tenants particularly those involved in developing and marketing pharmaceutical products are subject to certain unique risks as follows 

• some of our tenants require significant outlays of funds for the research development and clinical testing of their products and technologies if private investors the government or other sources of funding are unavailable to support such activities a tenants business may be adversely affected or fail • the research development clinical testing manufacture and marketing of some of our tenants products require federal state and foreign regulatory approvals which may be costly or difficult to obtain • even after a life science tenant gains regulatory approval and market acceptance the product may still present significant regulatory and liability risks including among others the possible later discovery of safety concerns competition from new products and ultimately the expiration of patent protection for the product • our tenants with marketable products may be adversely affected by healthcare reform and the reimbursement policies of government or private healthcare payors and • our tenants may be unable to adequately protect their intellectual property under patent copyright or trade secret laws we cannot assure you that our life science tenants will be successful in their businesses if our tenants businesses are adversely affected they may have difficulty making payments to us which could materially adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

we may be unable to successfully foreclose on the collateral securing our real estaterelated loans and even if we are successful in our foreclosure efforts we may be unable to successfully operate occupy or reposition the underlying real estate which may adversely affect our ability to recover our investments 

if an operator or tenant defaults under one of our mortgages or mezzanine loans we may have to foreclose on the loan or protect our interest by acquiring title to the collateral and thereafter making substantial improvements or repairs in order to maximize the propertys investment potential in some cases as noted above the collateral consists of the equity interests in an entity that directly or indirectly owns the applicable real property or interests in operating facilities and accordingly we may not have full recourse to assets of that entity operators tenants or borrowers may contest enforcement of foreclosure or other remedies seek bankruptcy protection against our exercise of enforcement or other remedies andor bring claims for lender liability in response to actions to enforce mortgage obligations foreclosurerelated costs high loantovalue ratios or declines in the value of the facility may prevent us from realizing an amount equal to our mortgage or mezzanine loan upon foreclosure and we may be required to record a valuation allowance for such losses even if we are able to successfully foreclose on the collateral securing our real estaterelated loans we may inherit properties for which we may be unable to expeditiously seek tenants or operators if at all or equity interests that we are unable to immediately resell due to limitations under the securities laws either of which would adversely affect our ability to fully recover our investment 

required regulatory approvals can delay or prohibit transfers of our healthcare facilities 

transfers of healthcare facilities to successor tenants or operators may be subject to regulatory approvals or ratifications including but not limited to change of ownership approvals under certificate of need laws and medicare and medicaid provider arrangements that are not required for transfers of other types of commercial operations and other types of real estate the replacement of any tenant or operator could be delayed by the regulatory approval process of any federal state or local government agency necessary for the transfer of the facility or the replacement of the operator licensed to manage the facility if we are unable to find a suitable replacement tenant or operator upon favorable terms or at all we may take possession of a facility which might expose us to successor liability require us to indemnify subsequent operators to whom we might transfer the operating rights and licenses or spend substantial time and funds to adapt the facility to other uses all of which may materially adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

competition may make it difficult to identify and purchase or develop suitable healthcare facilities to grow our investment portfolio 

we face significant competition from other reits investment companies private equity and hedge fund investors sovereign funds healthcare operators lenders developers and other institutional investors some of whom may have greater resources and lower costs of capital than we do increased competition makes it more challenging for us to identify and successfully capitalize on opportunities that meet our business goals and could improve the bargaining power of property owners seeking to sell thereby impeding our investment acquisition and development activities if we cannot capitalize on our development pipeline identify and purchase a sufficient quantity of healthcare facilities at favorable prices or if we are unable to finance acquisitions on commercially favorable terms our business results of operations and financial condition may be materially adversely affected 

we may be required to incur substantial renovation costs to make certain of our healthcare properties suitable for other operators and tenants 

healthcare facilities are typically highly customized and may not be easily adapted to nonhealthcarerelated uses the improvements generally required to conform a property to healthcare use such as upgrading electrical gas and plumbing infrastructure are costly and at times tenantspecific a new or replacement operator or tenant may require different features in a property depending on that operators or tenants particular business if a current operator or tenant is unable to pay rent andor vacates a property we may incur substantial expenditures to modify a property before we are able to secure another operator or tenant also if the property needs to be renovated to accommodate multiple operators or tenants we may incur substantial expenditures before we are able to release the space these expenditures or renovations may materially adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

we face additional risks associated with property development that can render a project less profitable or not profitable at all and under certain circumstances prevent completion of development activities once undertaken 

largescale groundup development of healthcare properties presents additional risks for us including risks that 

• a development opportunity may be abandoned after expending significant resources resulting in the loss of deposits or failure to recover expenses already incurred • the development and construction costs of a project may exceed original estimates due to increased interest rates and higher materials transportation labor leasing or other costs which could make the completion of the development project less profitable 20 

• construction andor permanent financing may not be available on favorable terms or at all • the project may not be completed on schedule as a result of a variety of factors that are beyond our control including natural disasters labor conditions material shortages regulatory hurdles civil unrest and acts of war which can result in increases in construction costs and debt service expenses or provide tenants or operators with the right to terminate preconstruction leases and • occupancy rates and rents at a newly completed property may not meet expected levels and could be insufficient to make the property profitable these risks could result in substantial unanticipated delays or expenses and under certain circumstances could prevent completion of development activities once undertaken any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

our use of joint ventures may limit our flexibility with jointly owned investments 

we have and may continue in the future to develop andor acquire properties in joint ventures with other persons or entities when circumstances warrant the use of these structures our participation in joint ventures is subject to risks that may not be present with other methods of ownership including 

• we could experience an impasse on certain decisions because we do not have sole decisionmaking authority which could require us to expend additional resources on resolving such impasses or potential disputes including litigation or arbitration • our joint venture partners could have investment goals that are not consistent with our investment objectives including the timing terms and strategies for any investments • our ability to transfer our interest in a joint venture to a third party may be restricted • our joint venture partners might become bankrupt fail to fund their share of required capital contributions or fail to fulfill their obligations as a joint venture partner which may require us to infuse our own capital into the venture on behalf of the partner despite other competing uses for such capital and • our joint venture partners may have competing interests in our markets that could create conflict of interest issues from time to time we acquire other companies and if we are unable to successfully integrate these operations our business results of operations and financial condition may be materially adversely affected 

acquisitions require the integration of companies that have previously operated independently successful integration of the operations of these companies depends primarily on our ability to consolidate operations systems procedures properties and personnel and to eliminate redundancies and costs we may encounter difficulties in these integrations potential difficulties associated with acquisitions include the loss of key employees the disruption of our ongoing business or that of the acquired entity possible inconsistencies in standards controls procedures and policies and the assumption of unexpected liabilities including 

• liabilities relating to the cleanup or remediation of undisclosed environmental conditions • unasserted claims of vendors or other persons dealing with the seller • liabilities claims and litigation whether or not incurred in the ordinary course of business relating to periods prior to our acquisition • claims for indemnification by general partners directors officers and others indemnified by the seller and 21 

• liabilities for taxes relating to periods prior to our acquisition in addition the acquired companies and their properties may fail to perform as expected including in respect of estimated cost savings inaccurate assumptions regarding future rental or occupancy rates could result in overly optimistic estimates of future revenues similarly we may underestimate future operating expenses or the costs necessary to bring properties up to standards established for their intended use if we have difficulties with any of these areas or if we later discover additional liabilities or experience unforeseen costs relating to our acquired companies we might not achieve the economic benefits we expect from our acquisitions and this may materially adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

from time to time we have made and in the future we may seek to make one or more material acquisitions which may involve the expenditure of significant funds 

we regularly review potential transactions in order to maximize stockholder value and believe that currently there are available a number of acquisition opportunities that would be complementary to our business given the recent industry consolidation trend in connection with our review of such transactions we regularly engage in discussions with potential acquisition candidates some of which are material any future acquisitions could require the issuance of securities the incurrence of debt assumption of contingent liabilities or incurrence of significant expenditures any of which could materially adversely impact our business financial condition or results of operations in addition the financing required for such acquisitions may not be available on commercially favorable terms or at all 

loss of our key personnel could temporarily disrupt our operations and adversely affect us 

we are dependent on the efforts of our executive officers and competition for these individuals is intense although our chief executive officer chief financial officer chief investment officer and general counsel have employment agreements with us we cannot assure you that they will remain employed with us the loss or limited availability of the services of any of our executive officers or our inability to recruit and retain qualified personnel in the future could at least temporarily have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition and the value of our common stock 

unfavorable resolution of litigation matters and disputes could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition 

from time to time we are involved in legal proceedings lawsuits and other claims we may also be named as defendants in lawsuits allegedly arising out of our actions or the actions of our operators and tenants in which such operators and tenants have agreed to indemnify defend and hold us harmless from and against various claims litigation and liabilities arising in connection with their respective businesses an unfavorable resolution of litigation may have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition regardless of its outcome litigation may result in substantial costs and expenses and significantly divert the attention of management there can be no assurance that we will be able to prevail in or achieve a favorable settlement of litigation in addition litigation government proceedings or environmental matters could lead to increased costs or interruption of our normal business operations 

we may experience uninsured or underinsured losses which could result in a significant loss of the capital we have invested in a property decrease anticipated future revenues or cause us to incur unanticipated expense 

we maintain comprehensive insurance coverage on our properties with terms conditions limits and deductibles that we believe are adequate and appropriate given the relative risk and costs of such 

coverage and we continually review the insurance maintained by us however a large number of our properties are located in areas exposed to earthquake windstorm flood and other natural disasters and may be subject to other losses in particular our life science portfolio is concentrated in areas known to be subject to earthquake activity while we purchase insurance for earthquake windstorm flood and other natural disasters that we believe is adequate in light of current industry practice and analyses prepared by outside consultants there is no assurance that such insurance will fully cover such losses these losses can decrease our anticipated revenues from a property and result in the loss of all or a portion of the capital we have invested in a property following these events we may remain obligated for any mortgage debt or other financial obligations related to the property the insurance market for such exposures can be very volatile and we may be unable to purchase the limits and terms we desire on a commercially reasonable basis in the future in addition there are certain exposures where insurance is not purchased as we do not believe it is economically feasible to do so or where there is no viable insurance market 

environmental compliance costs and liabilities associated with our real estate related investments may materially impair the value of those investments 

under various federal state and local laws ordinances and regulations as a current or previous owner of real estate we may be required to investigate and clean up certain hazardous or toxic substances or petroleum released at a property and may be held liable to a governmental entity or to third parties for property damage and for investigation and cleanup costs incurred by the third parties in connection with the contamination in addition some environmental laws create a lien on the contaminated site in favor of the government for damages and the costs it incurs in connection with the contamination although we i currently carry environmental insurance on our properties in an amount and subject to deductibles that we believe are commercially reasonable and ii generally require our operators and tenants to undertake to indemnify us for environmental liabilities they cause such liabilities could exceed the amount of our insurance the financial ability of the tenant or operator to indemnify us or the value of the contaminated property the presence of contamination or the failure to remediate contamination may materially adversely affect our ability to sell or lease the real estate or to borrow using the real estate as collateral as the owner of a site we may also be held liable to third parties for damages and injuries resulting from environmental contamination emanating from the site although we are generally indemnified by the current operators or tenants of our properties for contamination caused by them these indemnities may not adequately cover all environmental costs we may also experience environmental liabilities arising from conditions not known to us 

the impact of the comprehensive healthcare regulation enacted in 2010 on us and operators and tenants cannot accurately be predicted 

legislative proposals are introduced or proposed in congress and in some state legislatures each year that would affect major changes in the healthcare system either nationally or at the state level notably in march 2010 president obama signed into law the affordable care act the passage of the affordable care act has resulted in comprehensive reform legislation that is expanding healthcare coverage to millions of currently uninsured people beginning in 2014 and that provides for significant changes to the us healthcare system over the next ten years to help fund this expansion the affordable care act outlines certain reductions in medicare reimbursements for various healthcare providers including longterm acute care hospitals and skilled nursing facilities as well as certain other changes to medicare payment methodologies this comprehensive healthcare legislation provides for extensive future rulemaking by regulatory authorities and also may be altered or amended we cannot accurately predict whether any pending legislative proposals will be adopted or if adopted what effect if any these proposals would have on our operators and tenants and thus our business similarly while we can anticipate that some of the rulemaking that will be promulgated by regulatory authorities 

will affect our operators and tenants and the manner in which they are reimbursed by the federal healthcare programs we cannot accurately predict today the impact of those regulations on our operators and tenants and thus on our business 

the supreme courts decision upholding the constitutionality of the individual mandate while striking down the provisions linking federal funding of state medicaid programs with a federally mandated expansion of those programs has not reduced the uncertain impact that the law will have on healthcare delivery systems over the next decade we can expect that the federal authorities will continue to implement the law but because of the supreme courts mixed ruling the implementation will take longer than originally expected with a commensurate increase in the period of uncertainty regarding the laws full longterm financial impact on the delivery of and payment for healthcare 

we rely on information technology in our operations and any material failure inadequacy interruption or security failure of that technology could harm our business 

we rely on information technology networks and systems including the internet to process transmit and store electronic information and to manage or support a variety of business processes including financial transactions and records personal identifying information and tenant and lease data we purchase some of our information technology from vendors on whom our systems depend we rely on commercially available systems software tools and monitoring to provide security for processing transmission and storage of confidential tenant and other customer information such as individually identifiable information including information relating to financial accounts although we have taken steps to protect the security of our information systems and the data maintained in those systems it is possible that our safety and security measures will not be able to prevent the systems improper functioning or damage or the improper access or disclosure of personally identifiable information such as in the event of cyberattacks security breaches including physical or electronic breakins computer viruses attacks by hackers and similar breaches can create system disruptions shutdowns or unauthorized disclosure of confidential information any failure to maintain proper function security and availability of our information systems could interrupt our operations damage our reputation subject us to liability claims or regulatory penalties and could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we are subject to certain provisions of maryland law and our charter relating to business combinations 

the maryland business combination act provides that unless exempted a maryland corporation may not engage in business combinations including a merger consolidation share exchange or in circumstances specified in the statute an asset transfer or issuance or reclassification of equity securities with an interested stockholder or an affiliate of an interested stockholder for five years after the most recent date on which the interested stockholder became an interested stockholder and thereafter unless specified criteria are met an interested stockholder is generally a person owning or controlling directly or indirectly 10 or more of the voting power of the outstanding voting stock of a maryland corporation unless our board of directors takes action to exempt us generally or with respect to certain transactions from this statute in the future the maryland business combination act will be applicable to business combinations between us and other persons 

in addition to the restrictions on business combinations contained in the maryland business combination act our charter also contains restrictions on business combinations our charter requires that except in certain circumstances business combinations including a merger or consolidation and certain asset transfers and issuances of securities with a related person including a beneficial owner of 10 or more of our outstanding voting stock be approved by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 90 of our outstanding voting stock 

the restrictions on business combinations provided under maryland law and contained in our charter may delay defer or prevent a change of control or other transaction even if such transaction involves a premium price for our common stock or our stockholders believe that such transaction is otherwise in their best interests 

risk related to tax including reitrelated risks 

loss of our tax status as a reit would substantially reduce our available funds and would have material adverse consequences for us and the value of our common stock 

qualification as a reit involves the application of numerous highly technical and complex provisions of the internal revenue code of 1986 as amended the code for which there are only limited judicial and administrative interpretations as well as the determination of various factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control we intend to continue to operate in a manner that enables us to qualify as a reit however our qualification and taxation as a reit depend upon our ability to meet through actual annual operating results asset diversification distribution levels and diversity of stock ownership the various qualification tests imposed under the code for example to qualify as a reit at least 95 of our gross income in any year must be derived from qualifying sources and we must make distributions to our stockholders aggregating annually at least 90 of our reit taxable income excluding net capital gains in addition new legislation regulations administrative interpretations or court decisions could change the tax laws or interpretations of the tax laws regarding qualification as a reit or the federal income tax consequences of that qualification in a manner that is materially adverse to our stockholders accordingly there is no assurance that we have operated or will continue to operate in a manner so as to qualify or remain qualified as a reit 

if we lose our reit status we will face serious tax consequences that will substantially reduce the funds available to make payments of principal and interest on the debt securities we issue and to make distributions to stockholders if we fail to qualify as a reit 

• we will not be allowed a deduction for distributions to stockholders in computing our taxable income • we will be subject to corporatelevel income tax including any applicable alternative minimum tax on our taxable income at regular corporate rates • we could be subject to increased state and local income taxes and • unless we are entitled to relief under relevant statutory provisions we will be disqualified from taxation as a reit for the four taxable years following the year during which we fail to qualify as a reit as a result of all these factors our failure to qualify as a reit also could impair our ability to expand our business and raise capital and could materially adversely affect the value of our common stock 

we could have potential deferred and contingent tax liabilities from corporate acquisitions that could limit delay or impede future sales of our properties 

if during the tenyear period beginning on the date we acquire certain companies we recognize gain on the disposition of any property acquired then to the extent of the excess of i the fair market value of such property as of the acquisition date over ii our adjusted income tax basis in such property as of that date we will be required to pay a corporatelevel federal income tax on this gain at the highest regular corporate rate there can be no assurance that these triggering dispositions will not occur and these requirements could limit delay or impede future sales of our properties 

in addition the irs may assert liabilities against us for corporate income taxes for taxable years prior to the time that we acquire certain companies in which case we will owe these taxes plus interest and penalties if any 

there are uncertainties relating to the calculation of nonreit tax earnings and profits ep in certain acquisitions which may require us to distribute ep 

in order to remain qualified as a reit we are required to distribute to our stockholders all of the accumulated nonreit ep of certain companies that we acquire prior to the close of the first taxable year in which the acquisition occurs failure to make such ep distributions would result in our disqualification as a reit the determination of the amount to be distributed in such ep distributions is a complex factual and legal determination we may have less than complete information at the time we undertake our analysis or we may interpret the applicable law differently from the irs we currently believe that we have satisfied the requirements relating to such ep distributions there are however substantial uncertainties relating to the determination of ep including the possibility that the irs could successfully assert that the taxable income of the companies acquired should be increased which would increase our nonreit ep moreover an audit of the acquired company following our acquisition could result in an increase in accumulated nonreit ep which could require us to pay an additional taxable distribution to our thenexisting stockholders if we qualify under rules for curing this type of default or could result in our disqualification as a reit 

thus we might fail to satisfy the requirement that we distribute all of our nonreit ep by the close of the first taxable year in which the acquisition occurs moreover although there are procedures available to cure a failure to distribute all of our ep we cannot now determine whether we will be able to take advantage of these procedures or the economic impact on us of doing so 

our charter contains ownership limits with respect to our common stock and other classes of capital stock 

our charter contains restrictions on the ownership and transfer of our common stock and preferred stock that are intended to assist us in preserving our qualification as a reit under our charter subject to certain exceptions no person or entity may own actually or constructively more than 98 by value or by number of shares whichever is more restrictive of the outstanding shares of our common stock or any class or series of our preferred stock 

additionally our charter has a 99 ownership limitation on the direct or indirect ownership of our voting shares which may include common stock or other classes of capital stock our board of directors in its sole discretion may exempt a proposed transferee from either ownership limit the ownership limits may delay defer or prevent a transaction or a change of control that might involve a premium price for our common stock or might otherwise be in the best interests of our stockholders

the information set forth in this item 7 is intended to provide readers with an understanding of our financial condition changes in financial condition and results of operations we will discuss and provide our analysis in the following order 

• executive summary • 2013 transaction overview • dividends • critical accounting policies • results of operations • liquidity and capital resources • nongaap financial measure—funds from operations • offbalance sheet arrangements • contractual obligations • inflation • recent accounting pronouncements executive summary 

we are a selfadministered reit that together with our unconsolidated joint ventures invests primarily in real estate serving the healthcare industry in the us we acquire develop lease manage and dispose of healthcare real estate and provide financing to healthcare providers at december 31 2013 our portfolio of investments including properties owned by our investment management platform consisted of interests in 1153 facilities 

our business strategy is based on three principles i opportunistic investing ii portfolio diversification and iii conservative financing we actively redeploy capital from investments with lower return potential or shorter investment horizons into assets representing longer term investments with attractive riskadjusted return potential we make investments where the expected riskadjusted return exceeds our cost of capital and strive to capitalize on our operator tenant and other business relationships to grow our business 

our strategy contemplates acquiring and developing properties on terms that are favorable to us generally we prefer larger more complex private transactions that leverage our management teams experience and our infrastructure we follow a disciplined approach to enhancing the value of our existing portfolio including ongoing evaluation of potential disposition of properties that no longer fit our strategy 

we primarily generate revenue by leasing healthcare properties under longterm leases with fixed andor inflation indexed escalators most of our rents and other earned income from leases are received under triplenet leases or leases that provide for substantial recovery of operating expenses however some of our medical office and life science leases are structured as gross or modified gross leases operating expenses are generally related to mobs and life science leased properties and senior housing properties managed by eligible independent contractors on our behalf ridea properties accordingly for such mobs life science facilities and ridea properties we incur certain property operating expenses such as real estate taxes repairs and maintenance property management fees utilities employee costs for resident care and insurance our growth for these assets depends in part on our ability to i increase rental income and other earned income from leases by increasing rental rates and occupancy levels ii maximize tenant recoveries given underlying lease structures and iii control operating and other expenses our operations are impacted by property specific market specific general economic and other conditions at december 31 2013 the contractual maturities in our portfolio of leased assets were 17 through 2017 measured in dollars of expiring base rents 

access to capital markets impacts our cost of capital and ability to refinance maturing indebtedness as well as to fund future acquisitions and development through the issuance of additional securities or secured debt access to external capital on favorable terms is critical to the success of our strategy

critical accounting policies 

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap requires our management to use judgment in the application of accounting policies including making estimates and assumptions we base estimates on the best information available to us at the time our experience and on various other assumptions believed to be reasonable under the circumstances these estimates affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods if our judgment or interpretation of the facts and circumstances relating to various transactions or other matters had been different it is possible that different accounting would have been applied resulting in a different presentation of our consolidated financial statements from time to time we reevaluate our estimates and assumptions in the event estimates or assumptions prove to be different from actual results adjustments are made in subsequent periods to reflect more current estimates and assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain for a more detailed discussion of our significant accounting policies see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements below is a discussion of accounting policies that we consider critical in that they may require complex judgment in their application or require estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain 

principles of consolidation 

the consolidated financial statements include the accounts of hcp inc our wholly owned subsidiaries and joint ventures that we control through voting rights or other means we consolidate investments in variable interest entities vies when we are the primary beneficiary of the vie a variable interest holder is considered to be the primary beneficiary of a vie if it has the power to direct the activities of a variable interest entity that most significantly impact the entitys economic 

performance and has the obligation to absorb losses of or the right to receive benefits from the entity that could potentially be significant to the vie 

we make judgments with respect to our level of influence or control of an entity and whether we are or are not the primary beneficiary of a vie consideration of various factors includes but is not limited to our ability to direct the activities that most significantly impact the entitys economic performance our form of ownership interest our representation on the entitys governing body the size and seniority of our investment our ability and the rights of other investors to participate in policy making decisions replace the manager andor liquidate the entity if applicable our ability to correctly assess our influence or control over an entity when determining the primary beneficiary of a vie affects the presentation of these entities in our consolidated financial statements when we perform a primary beneficiary analysis at a date other than at inception of the variable interest entity our assumptions may be different and may result in the identification of a different primary beneficiary 

if we determine that we are the primary beneficiary of a vie our consolidated financial statements would include the operating results of the vie either tenant or borrower rather than the results of the variable interest in the vie we would require the vie to provide us timely financial information and would review the internal control of the vie to determine if we could rely on the financial information they provide if the vie has deficiencies in its internal control over financial reporting or does not provide us with timely financial information this may adversely impact the quality andor timing of our financial reporting and our internal control over financial reporting 

revenue recognition 

at the inception of a new lease arrangement including new leases that arise from amendments we assess the terms and conditions to determine the proper lease classification a lease arrangement is classified as an operating lease if none of the following criteria are met i transfer of ownership to the lessee ii lessee has a bargain purchase option during or at the end of the lease term iii the lease term is equal to 75 or more of the underlying propertys economic life or iv the future minimum lease payments excluding executory costs are equal to 90 or more of the excess estimated fair value over retained tax credits of the leased building if one of the four criteria is met and the minimum lease payments are determined to be reasonably predicable and collectible the lease arrangement is generally accounted for as a direct financing lease if the assumptions utilized in the above classification assessments were different our lease classification for accounting purposes may have been different thus the timing and amount of our revenue recognized would have been impacted which may be material to our consolidated financial statements 

we recognize rental revenue for operating leases on a straightline basis over the lease term when collectibility is reasonably assured and the tenant has taken possession or controls the physical use of a leased asset for assets acquired subject to leases we recognize revenue upon acquisition of the asset provided the tenant has taken possession or control of the physical use of the leased asset if the lease provides for tenant improvements we determine whether the tenant improvements for accounting purposes are owned by the tenant or us when we are the owner of the tenant improvements the tenant is not considered to have taken physical possession or have control of the physical leased asset until the tenant improvements are substantially completed when the tenant is the owner of the tenant improvements any tenant improvement allowance funded is treated as a lease incentive and amortized as a reduction of revenue over the lease term the determination of ownership of the tenant improvements is subject to significant judgment if our assessment of the owner of the tenant improvements for accounting purposes were different the timing and amount of our revenue recognized would be impacted 

certain leases provide for additional rents that are contingent upon a percentage of the facilitys revenue in excess of specified base amounts or other thresholds such revenue is recognized when 

actual results reported by the tenant or estimates of tenant results exceed the base amount or other thresholds the recognition of additional rents requires us to make estimates of amounts owed and to a certain extent are dependent on the accuracy of the facility results reported to us our estimates may differ from actual results which could be material to our consolidated financial statements 

we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts including an allowance for operating lease straightline rent receivables for estimated losses resulting from tenant defaults or the inability of tenants to make contractual rent and tenant recovery payments we monitor the liquidity and creditworthiness of our tenants and operators on a continuous basis this evaluation considers industry and economic conditions property performance credit enhancements and other factors for straightline rent amounts our assessment is based on income recoverable over the term of the lease we exercise judgment in establishing allowances and consider payment history and current credit status in developing these estimates these estimates may differ from actual results which could be material to our consolidated financial statements 

we use the direct finance method of accounting to record income from dfls for leases accounted for as dfls future minimum lease payments are recorded as a receivable for leases accounted for as dfls the net investment in the dfl represents receivables for the sum of minimum lease payments receivable and the estimated residual values of the leased properties less the unearned income unearned income is deferred and amortized to income over the lease terms to provide a constant yield when collectibility of the lease payments is reasonably assured investments in dfls are presented net of unamortized unearned income the determination of estimated useful lives and residual values are subject to significant judgment if these assessments for accounting purposes were to change the timing and amount of our revenue recognized would be impacted 

loans receivable are classified as heldforinvestment based on managements intent and ability to hold the loans for the foreseeable future or to maturity we recognize interest income on loans including the amortization of discounts and premiums using the interest method applied on a loanbyloan basis when collectibility of the future payments is reasonably assured premiums discounts and related costs are recognized as yield adjustments over the term of the related loans 

loans and dfls are placed on nonaccrual status at such time as management determines that collectibility of contractual amounts is not reasonably assured while on nonaccrual status loans and dfls are either accounted for on a cash basis in which income is recognized only upon receipt of cash or on a costrecovery basis were cash receipts reduce the carrying value of the loan or dfl based on managements judgment of collectibility 

allowances are established for loans and dfls based upon an estimate of probable losses on an individual basis if they are determined to be impaired loans and dfls are impaired when it is deemed probable that we will be unable to collect all amounts due on a timely basis in accordance with the contractual terms of the loan or lease determining the adequacy of the allowance is complex and requires significant judgment by us about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain the allowance is based upon our assessment of the borrowers or lessees overall financial condition resources and payment record the prospects for support from any financially responsible guarantors and if appropriate the net realizable value of any collateral these estimates consider all available evidence including as appropriate the present value of the expected future cash flows discounted at the loans or dfls effective interest rate the fair value of collateral general economic conditions and trends historical and industry loss experience and other relevant factors while our assumptions are based in part upon historical data our estimates may differ from actual results which could be material to our consolidated financial statements 

real estate 

we make estimates as part of our allocation of the purchase price of acquisitions to the various components of the acquisition based upon the relative fair value of each component the most significant components of our allocations are typically the allocation of fair value to the buildings asifvacant land and inplace leases in the case of the fair value of buildings and the allocation of value to land and other intangibles our estimates of the values of these components will affect the amount of depreciation and amortization we record over the estimated useful life of the property acquired or the remaining lease term in the case of the value of inplace leases we make our best estimates based on our evaluation of the specific characteristics of each tenants lease factors considered include estimates of carrying costs during hypothetical expected leaseup periods market conditions and costs to execute similar leases our assumptions affect the amount of future revenue that we will recognize over the remaining lease term for the acquired inplace leases 

a variety of costs are incurred in the development and leasing of properties after determination is made to capitalize a cost it is allocated to the specific component of a project that is benefited determination of when a development project is substantially complete and capitalization must cease involves a degree of judgment the costs of land and buildings under development include specifically identifiable costs the capitalized costs include preconstruction costs essential to the development of the property development costs construction costs interest costs real estate taxes and other costs incurred during the period of development we consider a construction project as substantially completed and held available for occupancy and cease capitalization of costs upon the completion of the related tenant improvements 

impairment of longlived assets and goodwill 

we assess the carrying value of our real estate assets and related intangibles real estate assets when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the real estate assets may not be recoverable recoverability of real estate assets is measured by comparison of the carrying amount of the real estate assets to the respective estimated future undiscounted cash flows the estimated future undiscounted cash flows are calculated utilizing the lowest level of identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities in order to review our real estate assets for recoverability we consider market conditions as well as our intent with respect to holding or disposing of the asset if our analysis indicates that the carrying value of the real estate assets is not recoverable on an undiscounted cash flow basis we recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the real estate asset 

goodwill is tested for impairment at least annually based on certain qualitative factors to determine if it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount potential impairment indicators and qualitative factors include a significant decline in real estate valuations restructuring plans current macroeconomic conditions state of the equity and capital markets or a significant decline in the value of our market capitalization if we determine that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount we apply the required twostep quantitative approach the quantitative procedures of the twostep approach i compares the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount including goodwill and if necessary ii compares the implied fair value of reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill as if it had been acquired in a business combination at the date of the impairment test the excess fair value of the reporting unit over the fair value of assets and liabilities is the implied value of goodwill and is used to determine the amount of impairment if any we estimate the fair value of the assets and liabilities in the reporting unit through various valuation techniques including applying capitalization rates to segment net operating income quoted market values and thirdparty appraisals as necessary the fair value of the reporting unit may also include an allocation of an enterprise value premium that we estimate a third party would be willing to pay for the company 

the determination of the fair value of real estate assets and goodwill involves significant judgment this judgment is based on our analysis and estimates of fair value of real estate assets and reporting units future operating results and resulting cash flows of each real estate asset whose carrying amount may not be recoverable our ability to accurately predict future operating results resulting cash flows and estimate and allocate fair values impacts the timing and recognition of impairments while we believe our assumptions are reasonable changes in these assumptions may have a material impact on our financial results 

investments in unconsolidated joint ventures 

investments in entities which we do not consolidate but have the ability to exercise significant influence over operating and financial policies are reported under the equity method of accounting under the equity method of accounting our share of the investees earnings or losses is included in our consolidated results of operations 

the initial carrying value of investments in unconsolidated joint ventures is based on the amount paid to purchase the joint venture interest or the carrying value of the assets prior to the sale or contribution of the interests to the joint venture we evaluate our equity method investments for impairment indicators based upon a comparison of the fair value of the equity method investment to our carrying value if we determine there is a decline in the fair value of our investment in an unconsolidated joint venture below its carrying value and it is otherthantemporary an impairment is recorded the determination of the fair value and as to whether a deficiency in fair value is otherthantemporary of investments in unconsolidated joint ventures involves significant judgment our estimates consider all available evidence including as appropriate the present value of the expected future cash flows discounted at market rates general economic conditions and trends severity and duration of the fair value deficiency and other relevant factors capitalization rates discount rates and credit spreads utilized in our valuation models are based upon rates that we believe to be within a reasonable range of current market rates for the respective investments while we believe our assumptions are reasonable changes in these assumptions may have a material impact on our financial results 

income taxes 

as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements significant management judgment is required to evaluate our compliance with reit requirements our determinations are based on interpretation of tax laws and our conclusions may have an impact on the income tax expense recognized adjustments to income tax expense may be required as a result of i audits conducted by federal state and local tax authorities ii our ability to qualify as a reit iii recognition of builtin gain associated with prior taxfree acquisitions of c corporations and iv changes in tax laws adjustments required in any given period are included within the income tax provision

we evaluate our business and allocate resources among our five business segments i senior housing ii postacuteskilled nursing iii life science iv medical office and v hospital under the senior housing life science postacuteskilled nursing and hospital segments we invest or coinvest primarily in single operator or tenant properties through the acquisition and development of real estate management of operations ridea and by debt issued by operators in these sectors under the medical office segment we invest or coinvest through the acquisition and development of mobs that are leased under gross modified gross or triplenet leases generally to multiple tenants and which generally require a greater level of property management the accounting policies of the segments are the same as those described in the summary of significant accounting policies see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements 

we use net operating income from continuing operations noi and adjusted noi to assess and compare property level performance including our same property portfolio spp and to make decisions about resource allocations and to assess and compare property level performance we believe these measures provide investors relevant and useful information because they reflect only income and operating expense items that are incurred at the property level and present them on an unleveraged basis we believe that net income is the most directly comparable gaap measure to noi noi should not be viewed as an alternative measure of operating performance to net income as defined by gaap since noi excludes certain components from net income further noi may not be comparable to that of other reits or real estate companies as they may use different methodologies for calculating noi see note 14 to the consolidated financial statements for additional segment information and the relevant reconciliations from net income to noi and adjusted noi 

operating expenses are generally related to mob and life science leased properties and senior housing properties managed by eligible independent contractors on our behalf ridea properties we generally recover all or a portion of mob and life science expenses from the tenants tenant recoveries the presentation of expenses as operating or general and administrative is based on the underlying nature of the expense periodically we review the classification of expenses between categories and make revisions based on changes in the underlying nature of the expenses 

our evaluation of results of operations by each business segment includes an analysis of our spp and our total property portfolio spp information allows us to evaluate the performance of our leased property portfolio under a consistent population by eliminating changes in the composition of our portfolio of properties we identify our spp as stabilized properties that remained in operations and were consistently reported as leased properties or ridea properties for the duration of the yearoveryear comparison periods presented accordingly it takes a stabilized property a minimum of 12 months in operations under a consistent reporting structure to be included in our spp newly acquired operating assets are generally considered stabilized at the earlier of leaseup typically when the tenants controls the physical use of at least 80 of the space or 12 months from the acquisition date newly completed developments and redevelopments are considered stabilized at the earlier of leaseup or 24 months from the date the property is placed in service spp noi excludes certain nonproperty specific operating expenses that are allocated to each operating segment on a consolidated basis

discontinued operations income from discontinued operations for the year ended december 31 2012 was 46 million compared to 18 million for the comparable period in 2011 the increase is primarily due to an increase in gains on real estate dispositions of 28 million partially offset by a decline in operating income from discontinued operations of 1 million during the year ended december 31 2012 we sold real estate investments for 151 million compared to 19 million for the year ended december 31 2011 

liquidity and capital resources 

our principal liquidity needs are to i fund recurring operating expenses ii meet debt service requirements including 487 million of senior unsecured notes and 180 million of mortgage debt principal payments and maturities in 2014 iii fund capital expenditures including tenant improvements and leasing costs iv fund acquisition and development activities and v make dividend distributions we anticipate that cash flow from continuing operations over the next 12 months will be adequate to fund our business operations debt service payments recurring capital expenditures and cash dividends to stockholders capital requirements relating to maturing indebtedness acquisitions development and redevelopment activities may require funding from borrowings andor equity and debt offerings 

access to capital markets impacts our cost of capital and ability to refinance maturing indebtedness as well as our ability to fund future acquisitions and development through the issuance of additional securities or secured debt credit ratings impact our ability to access capital and directly 

impact our cost of capital as well for example as noted below our revolving line of credit facility accrues interest at a rate per annum equal to libor plus a margin that depends upon our debt ratings we also pay a facility fee on the entire revolving commitment that depends upon our debt ratings as of january 31 2014 we had a credit rating of bbb from fitch baa1 from moodys and bbb from sp on our senior unsecured debt securities 

net cash provided by operating activities was 11 billion and 10 billion for the year ended december 31 2013 and 2012 respectively the increase in operating cash flows is primarily the result of the following i the impact of our investments in 2012 and 2013 ii assets placed in service during 2012 and 2013 and iii rent escalations and resets in 2012 and 2013 which increases were partially offset by increased debt interest payments our cash flows from operations are dependent upon the occupancy level of multitenant buildings rental rates on leases our tenants performance on their lease obligations the level of operating expenses and other factors 

the following are significant investing and financing activities for the year ended december 31 2013 

• made investments of 223 million loans development and acquisition of real estate net of loan repayments of 263 million and real estate sales of 96 million • paid dividends on common stock of 957 million which were generally funded by cash provided by our operating activities • repaid 852 million of mortgages and senior unsecured notes and • raised 800 million in senior unsecured notes debt 

bank line of credit and term loan our 15 billion unsecured revolving line of credit facility matures in march 2016 and contains a oneyear extension option borrowings under the facility accrue interest at libor plus a margin that depends upon our debt ratings we pay a facility fee on the entire revolving commitment that depends on our debt ratings based on our debt ratings at january 31 2014 the margin on the facility was 1075 and the facility fee was 0175 the facility also includes a feature that will allow us to increase the borrowing capacity by an aggregate amount of up to 500 million subject to securing additional commitments from existing lenders or new lending institutions at december 31 2013 we had no balance outstanding under this facility 

on july 30 2012 we entered into a credit agreement with a syndicate of banks for a £137 million 227 million at december 31 2013 fouryear unsecured term loan the term loan that accrues interest at a rate of gbp libor plus 120 based on our current debt ratings concurrent with the closing of the term loan we entered into a fouryear interest rate swap contract that fixes the rate of the term loan at 181 subject to adjustments based on our debt ratings the term loan contains a oneyear committed extension option the term loan was used to finance the purchase of our gbp denominated senior unsecured notes see note 10 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 

the facility and term loan contain certain financial restrictions and other customary requirements among other things these covenants using terms defined in the agreements i limit the ratio of consolidated total indebtedness to consolidated total asset value to 60 ii limit the ratio of secured debt to consolidated total asset value to 30 iii limit the ratio of unsecured debt to consolidated unencumbered asset value to 60 iv require a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio of 15 times and v require a formuladetermined minimum consolidated tangible net worth of 92 billion at december 31 2013 at december 31 2013 we were in compliance with each of these restrictions and requirements of the facility and term loan 

our facility also contains crossdefault provisions to other indebtedness of ours including in some instances certain mortgages on our properties certain mortgages contain default provisions relating to defaults under the leases or operating agreements on the applicable properties by our operators or tenants including default provisions relating to the bankruptcy filings of such operator or tenant although we believe that we would be able to secure amendments under the applicable agreements if a default as described above occurs such a default may result in significantly less favorable borrowing terms than currently available material delays in the availability of funding or other material adverse consequences 

senior unsecured notes at december 31 2013 we had senior unsecured notes outstanding with an aggregate principal balance of 70 billion interest rates on the notes ranged from 121 to 698 with a weighted average effective interest rate of 497 and a weighted average maturity of six years at december 31 2013 the senior unsecured notes contain certain covenants including limitations on debt maintenance of unencumbered assets crossacceleration provisions and other customary terms at december 31 2013 we believe we were in compliance with these covenants 

mortgage debt at december 31 2013 we had 14 billion in aggregate principal amount of mortgage debt outstanding that is secured by 126 healthcare facilities including redevelopment properties with a carrying value of 18 billion interest rates on the mortgage debt ranged from 069 to 869 with a weighted average effective interest rate of 619 and a weighted average maturity of three years at december 31 2013 

mortgage debt generally requires monthly principal and interest payments is collateralized by real estate assets and is generally nonrecourse mortgage debt typically restricts transfer of the encumbered assets prohibits additional liens restricts prepayment requires payment of real estate taxes requires maintenance of the assets in good condition requires maintenance of insurance on the assets and includes conditions to obtain lender consent to enter into and terminate material leases some of the mortgage debt is also crosscollateralized by multiple assets and may require tenants or operators to maintain compliance with the applicable leases or operating agreements of such real estate assets 

other debt at december 31 2013 we had 75 million of noninterest bearing life care bonds at two of our continuing care retirement communities and noninterest bearing occupancy fee deposits at two of our senior housing facilities all of which were payable to certain residents of the facilities collectively life care bonds the life care bonds are generally refundable to the residents upon the termination of the contract or upon the successful resale of the unit

nongaap financial measure—funds from operations ffo 

we believe ffo applicable to common shares diluted ffo applicable to common shares and basic and diluted ffo per common share are important supplemental nongaap measures of operating performance for a reit because the historical cost accounting convention used for real estate assets utilizes straightline depreciation except on land such accounting presentation implies that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time since real estate values instead have historically risen and fallen with market conditions presentations of operating results for a reit that uses historical cost accounting for depreciation could be less informative the term ffo was designed by the reit industry to address this issue 

ffo as defined by the national association of real estate investment trusts nareit is net income applicable to common shares computed in accordance with gaap excluding gains or losses from acquisition and dispositions of depreciable real estate or related interests impairments of or related to depreciable real estate plus real estate and dfl depreciation and amortization with adjustments for joint ventures adjustments for joint ventures are calculated to reflect ffo on the same basis ffo does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with gaap is not necessarily indicative of cash available to fund cash needs and should not be considered an alternative to net income we compute ffo in accordance with the current nareit definition however other reits may report ffo differently or have a different interpretation of the current nareit definition from ours in addition we present ffo before the impact of severancerelated charges litigation settlement charges preferred stock redemption charges impairments recoveries of nondepreciable assets and mergerrelated items defined below ffo as adjusted management believes ffo as adjusted is a useful alternative measurement this measure is a modification of the nareit definition of ffo and should not be used as an alternative to net income determined in accordance with gaap 

details of certain items that affect comparability are discussed under results of operations above the following is a reconciliation from net income applicable to common shares the most direct 

comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with gaap to ffo and ffo as adjusted in thousands except per share data 





1 our board of directors terminated our former chairman chief executive officer and president on october 2 2013 as a result of the termination we incurred severancerelated charges of 272 million that include i the acceleration of 167 million of deferred compensation for restricted stock units and options that vested upon termination and ii severance payments and other costs of approximately 105 million see note 16 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 2 in connection with the redemption of our preferred stock during the year ended december 31 2012 we incurred a redemption charge of 104 million related to the original issuance costs 3 the litigation settlement charge during the year ended december 31 2011 relates to the ventas settlement 4 the year ended december 31 2012 mergerrelated items of 002 per share attributable to the senior housing portfolio acquisition include direct transaction costs and the impact of the negative carry of prefunding the transaction with the 10 billion or 22 million shares common stock offering completed on october 19 2012 on the calculation of weighted average shares proceeds from this offering were used to fund the senior housing portfolio acquisition mergerrelated items for the year ended december 31 2011 are attributable to our hcr manorcare acquisition incurred from january 1st through april 6th 2011 which include the following i 268 million of direct transaction costs ii 239 million of interest expense associated with the 24 billion senior unsecured notes issued on january 24 2011 proceeds from which were obtained to prefund the hcr manorcare acquisition partially offset by iii 241 million of income related to gains upon the reinvestment of the our debt investment in hcr manorcare and other miscellaneous items 5 the following impairments net of recoveries had an impact on ffo • the impairment charge during the year ended december 31 2012 relates to the sale of a land parcel in our life science segment • the impairment charge during the year ended december 31 2011 relates to our senior secured loan to delphis 6 our weighted average shares used to calculate diluted ffo as adjusted eliminate the impact of 30 million shares from our march 2011 common stock offering excludes 45 million shares sold to the underwriters upon exercise of their option to purchase additional shares which issuance increased our weighted average shares by 129 million for the year ended december 31 2011 proceeds from this offering were used to fund a portion of the cash consideration for the hcr manorcare acquisition offbalance sheet arrangements 

we own interests in certain unconsolidated joint ventures as described under note 8 to the consolidated financial statements except in limited circumstances our risk of loss is limited to our investment in the joint venture and any outstanding loans receivable in addition we have certain properties which serve as collateral for debt that is owed by a previous owner of certain of our facilities as described under note 12 to the consolidated financial statements our risk of loss for these certain properties is limited to the outstanding debt balance plus penalties if any we have no other material offbalance sheet arrangements that we expect would materially affect our liquidity and capital resources except those described below under contractual obligations  

contractual obligations 

the following table summarizes our material contractual payment obligations and commitments at december 31 2013 in thousands 



1 excludes 75 million of other debt that represents life care bonds that have no scheduled maturities 2 represents £137 million translated into us dollars as of december 31 2013 3 represents commitments to finance development projects and related working capital financings 4 represents construction and other commitments for developments in progress 5 interest on variablerate debt is calculated using rates in effect at december 31 2013 inflation 

our leases often provide for either fixed increases in base rents or indexed escalators based on the consumer price index or other measures andor additional rent based on increases in the tenants operating revenues most of our mob leases require the tenant to pay a share of property operating costs such as real estate taxes insurance and utilities substantially all of our senior housing life science postacuteskilled nursing and hospital leases require the operator or tenant to pay all of the property operating costs or reimburse us for all such costs we believe that inflationary increases in expenses will be offset in part by the operator or tenant expense reimbursements and contractual rent increases described above 

recent accounting pronouncements 

see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for the impact of new accounting standards there were no accounting pronouncements that were issued but not yet adopted by us that we believe will materially impact our consolidated financial statements 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we use derivative financial instruments in the normal course of business to mitigate interest rate and foreign currency risk we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes derivatives are recorded on the consolidated balance sheets at their fair value see note 24 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 

to illustrate the effect of movements in the interest rate and foreign currency markets we performed a market sensitivity analysis on our hedging instruments we applied various basis point spreads to the underlying interest rate curves and foreign currency exchange rates of the derivative portfolio in order to determine the instruments change in fair value assuming a one percentage point change in the underlying interest rate curve and foreign currency exchange rates the estimated change 

in fair value of each of the underlying derivative instruments would not exceed 6 million see note 24 to the consolidated financial statements for additional analysis details 

interest rate risk at december 31 2013 we are exposed to market risks related to fluctuations in interest rates on the following i properties with a gross value of 83 million that are subject to leases where the payments fluctuate with changes in libor that are partially offset by ii 25 million of variablerate senior unsecured notes and iii 9 million of variablerate mortgage debt payable excludes 72 million of variablerate mortgage notes that have been hedged through interestrate swap contracts  additionally our exposure to market risks related to fluctuations in interest rates excludes our gbp denominated 227 million £137 million variablerate term loan that has been hedged through interestrate swap contracts 

interest rate fluctuations will generally not affect our future earnings or cash flows on our fixed rate debt and assets unless such instruments mature or are otherwise terminated however interest rate changes will affect the fair value of our fixed rate instruments conversely changes in interest rates on variable rate debt and investments would change our future earnings and cash flows but not significantly affect the fair value of those instruments assuming a one percentage point increase in the interest rate related to the variablerate investments and variablerate debt and assuming no other changes in the outstanding balance as of december 31 2013 our annual interest expense would increase by approximately 1 million or less than 001 per common share on a diluted basis 

foreign currency exchange rate risk at december 31 2013 our exposure to foreign currency exchange rates relates to forecasted interest receipts from our gbp denominated senior unsecured notes see additional discussion of the four seasons senior unsecured notes in note 10 to the consolidated financial statements our foreign currency exchange exposure is mitigated by the forecasted interest and principal payments from our gbp denominated unsecured term loan see note 11 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information and a foreign currency swap contract for approximately 85 of the forecasted interest receipts from our four seasons senior unsecured notes through their noncall period which ends on june 15 2016 

market risk we have investments in marketable debt securities classified as heldtomaturity because we have the positive intent and ability to hold the securities to maturity heldtomaturity securities are recorded at amortized cost and adjusted for the amortization of premiums and discounts through maturity we consider a variety of factors in evaluating an otherthantemporary decline in value such as the length of time and the extent to which the market value has been less than our current adjusted carrying value the issuers financial condition capital strength and nearterm prospects any recent events specific to that issuer and economic conditions of its industry and our investment horizon in relationship to an anticipated nearterm recovery in the market value if any at december 31 2013 the fair value and carrying value of marketable debt securities were 281 million and 244 million respectively 

the principal amount and the average interest rates for our loans receivable and debt categorized by maturity dates is presented in the table below the fair value for our senior unsecured notes payable is based on prevailing market prices the fair value estimates for loans receivable and mortgage debt 

payable are based on discounting future cash flows utilizing current rates for loans and debt of the same type and remaining maturity 



1 effective january 1 2011 a senior secured loan to delphis was placed on nonaccrual status for additional information regarding the senior secured loan to delphis see note 7 to the consolidated financial statements 2 excludes 75 million of other debt that represents noninterest bearing life care bonds and occupancy fee deposits at certain of our senior housing facilities which have no scheduled maturities

the delivery of healthcare services requires real estate and as a result tenants and operators depend on real estate in part to maintain and grow their businesses we believe that the healthcare real estate market provides investment opportunities due to the following 

• compelling demographics driving the demand for healthcare services • specialized nature of healthcare real estate investing and • ongoing consolidation of a fragmented healthcare real estate sector our website address is wwwhcpicom  our annual reports on form 10k quarterly reports on form 10q current reports on form 8k and any amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to section 13a or 15d of the securities exchange act of 1934 the exchange act are available on our website free of charge as soon as reasonably practicable after we electronically file such materials with or furnish them to the united states us securities and exchange commission sec

business strategy 

our primary goal is to increase shareholder value through profitable growth which allows us to maintain or increase dividends per share to our shareholders our investment strategy to achieve this goal is based on three principles i opportunistic investing ii portfolio diversification and iii conservative financing 

opportunistic investing 

we make investment decisions that are expected to drive profitable growth and create shareholder value we attempt to position ourselves to create and take advantage of situations to meet our goals and investment criteria 

portfolio diversification 

we believe in maintaining a portfolio of healthcare investments diversified by segment geography operator tenant and investment product we monitor but do not limit our investments based on the percentage of our total assets that may be invested in any one property type investment product geographic location the number of properties which we may lease to a single operator or tenant or loans we may make to a single borrower with investments in multiple segments and investment products we can focus on opportunities with the most attractive riskreward profile for the portfolio as a whole we may structure transactions as master leases require operator or tenant insurance and indemnifications obtain credit enhancements in the form of guarantees letters of credit or security deposits and take other measures to mitigate risk 

conservative financing 

we believe a conservative balance sheet is important to our ability to execute our opportunistic investing approach we strive to maintain a conservative balance sheet by actively managing our debttoequity levels and maintaining multiple sources of liquidity such as our revolving line of credit facility access to capital markets and secured debt lenders relationships with current and prospective institutional joint venture partners and our ability to divest of assets our debt obligations are primarily fixed rate with staggered maturities which reduces the impact of rising interest rates on our operations 

we finance our investments based on our evaluation of available sources of funding for shortterm purposes we may utilize our revolving line of credit facility or arrange for other shortterm borrowings from banks or other sources we arrange for longerterm financing through offerings of 

equity and debt securities placement of mortgage debt and capital from other institutional lenders and equity investors 

we specifically incorporate by reference into this section the information set forth in item 7 2012 transaction overview included elsewhere in this report 

competition 

investing in real estate serving the healthcare industry is highly competitive we face competition from other reits investment companies pension funds private equity and hedge fund investors sovereign funds healthcare operators lenders developers and other institutional investors some of whom may have greater resources and lower costs of capital than we do increased competition makes it more challenging for us to identify and successfully capitalize on opportunities that meet our objectives our ability to compete may also be impacted by national and local economic trends availability of investment alternatives availability and cost of capital construction and renovation costs existing laws and regulations new legislation and population trends 

income from our facilities is dependent on the ability of our operators and tenants to compete with other companies on a number of different levels including the quality of care provided reputation the physical appearance of a facility price and range of services offered alternatives for healthcare delivery the supply of competing properties physicians staff referral sources location the size and demographics of the population in surrounding areas and the financial condition of our tenants and operators private federal and state payment programs as well as the effect of laws and regulations may also have a significant influence on the profitability of our tenants and operators for a discussion of the risks associated with competitive conditions affecting our business see risk factors in item 1a 

healthcare segments

• assisted living facilities alfs are licensed care facilities that provide personal care services support and housing for those who need help with activities of daily living adl such as bathing eating and dressing yet require limited medical care the programs and services may include transportation social activities exercise and fitness programs beauty or barber shop access hobby and craft activities community excursions meals in a dining room setting and other activities sought by residents these facilities are often in apartmentlike buildings with private residences ranging from single rooms to large apartments certain alfs may offer higher levels of personal assistance for residents requiring memory care as a result of alzheimers disease or other forms of dementia levels of personal assistance are based in part on local regulations at december 31 2012 we had interests in 363 alfs • independent living facilities ilfs are designed to meet the needs of seniors who choose to live in an environment surrounded by their peers with services such as housekeeping meals and activities these residents generally do not need assistance with adl however in some of our 5 

facilities residents have the option to contract for these services at december 31 2012 we had interests in 64 ilfs 

• continuing care retirement communities ccrcs provide housing and healthrelated services under longterm contracts this alternative is appealing to residents as it eliminates the need for relocating when health and medical needs change thus allowing residents to age in place some ccrcs require a substantial entry or buyin fee and most also charge monthly maintenance fees in exchange for a living unit meals and some health services ccrcs typically require the individual to be in relatively good health and independent upon entry at december 31 2012 we had interests in 14 ccrcs during the fourth quarter of 2012 we acquired 129 senior housing communities for 17 billion from a joint venture between emeritus corporation and blackstone real estate partners vi an affiliate of blackstone the blackstone jv located in 29 states the portfolio encompasses 10077 units representing a diversified care mix of 61 assisted living 25 independent living 13 memory care and 1 skilled nursing emeritus continues to operate the communities pursuant to a new triplenet master lease for the 129 properties guaranteed by emeritus for a more detailed description of the acquisition see note 4 to the consolidated financial statements 

our senior housing segment accounted for approximately 33 30 and 30 of total revenues for the years ended december 31 2012 2011 and 2010 respectively the following table provides information about our senior housing operator concentration for the year ended december 31 2012 



1 percentage of total revenues includes revenues earned from both our senior housing and postacuteskilled nursing facilities leased to hcr manorcare 2 percentage of total revenues from emeritus includes partial results for blackstone jv acquisition assuming that fullyear results were included for this acquisition in our 2012 revenues the percentage of segment revenues and total revenues would be 36 and 12 respectively 3 certain of our properties are leased to tenants who have entered into management contracts with sunrise to operate the respective property on their behalf to determine our concentration of revenues generated from properties operated by sunrise we aggregate revenue from these tenants with revenue generated from the two properties that are leased directly to sunrise 4 brookdale percentages do not include 143 million of senior housing revenues related to 21 senior housing facilities that brookdale operates on our behalf under a ridea structure assuming that these revenues were attributable to brookdale the percentage of combined segment and total revenues associated brookdale would be 36 and 12 respectively postacuteskilled nursing at december 31 2012 we had interests in 312 postacuteskilled nursing facilities snfs snfs offer restorative rehabilitative and custodial nursing care for people not requiring the more extensive and sophisticated treatment available at hospitals ancillary revenues and revenues from subacute care services are derived from providing services to residents beyond room and board and include occupational physical speech respiratory and intravenous therapy wound care oncology treatment brain injury care and orthopedic therapy as well as sales of pharmaceutical products and other services certain snfs provide some of the foregoing services on an outpatient basis postacuteskilled nursing services provided by our operators and tenants in these facilities are primarily paid for either by private sources or through the medicare and medicaid programs all of our snfs are leased to single tenants under triplenet lease structures

1 percentage of total revenues includes revenues earned from both senior housing and postacuteskilled nursing facilities leased to hcr manorcare life science at december 31 2012 we had interests in 113 life science properties including four facilities owned by our investment management platform these properties contain laboratory and office space primarily for biotechnology medical device and pharmaceutical companies scientific research institutions government agencies and other organizations involved in the life science industry while these properties contain similar characteristics to commercial office buildings they generally contain more advanced electrical mechanical and heating ventilating and air conditioning hvac systems the facilities generally have specialty equipment including emergency generators fume hoods lab bench tops and related amenities in many instances life science tenants make significant investments to improve their leased space in addition to landlord improvements to accommodate biology chemistry or medical device research initiatives life science properties are primarily configured in business park or campus settings and include multiple buildings the business park and campus settings allow us the opportunity to provide flexible contiguousadjacent expansion to accommodate the growth of existing tenants our properties are located in wellestablished geographical markets known for scientific research including san francisco san diego and salt lake city at december 31 2012 96 of our life science leases based on leased square feet were under triplenet structures 

our life science segment accounted for approximately 15 17 and 22 of total revenues for the years ended december 31 2012 2011 and 2010 respectively the following table provides information about our life science tenant concentration for the year ended december 31 2012 



medical office at december 31 2012 we had interests in 273 medical office buildings mobs including 66 facilities owned by our investment management platform these facilities typically contain physicians offices and examination rooms and may also include pharmacies hospital ancillary service space and outpatient services such as diagnostic centers rehabilitation clinics and daysurgery operating rooms while these facilities are similar to commercial office buildings they require additional plumbing electrical and mechanical systems to accommodate multiple exam rooms that may require sinks in every room and special equipment such as xray machines in addition mobs are often built to accommodate higher structural loads for certain equipment and may contain vaults or other specialized construction our mobs are typically multitenant properties leased to healthcare providers hospitals and physician practices with approximately 77 of our mobs based on square feet located on hospital campuses and 94 are affiliated with hospital systems at december 31 2012 47 of our medical office leases based on leased square feet were under triplenet structures 

our medical office segment accounted for approximately 18 19 and 25 of total revenues for the years ended december 31 2012 2011 and 2010 respectively during the year ended december 31 2012 hca inc hca as our tenant contributed 14 of our medical office segment revenues 

our investment management platform represents the following unconsolidated joint ventures i hcp ventures iii llc and hcp ventures iv llc which consists of mob portfolios and ii the hcp life science ventures for a more detailed description of these unconsolidated joint ventures see note 8 to the consolidated financial statements 

hospital at december 31 2012 we had interests in 21 hospitals including four facilities owned by our investment management platform services provided by our operators and tenants in these facilities are paid for by private sources thirdparty payors eg insurance and health maintenance organizations or hmos or through the medicare and medicaid programs our hospital property types include acute care longterm acute care specialty and rehabilitation hospitals our hospitals are generally leased to single tenants or operators under triplenet lease structures 

our hospital segment accounted for approximately 5 5 and 10 of total revenues for the years ended december 31 2012 2011 and 2010 respectively the following table provides information about our hospital operatortenant concentration for the year ended december 31 2012 



1 percentage of total revenues from hca includes revenues earned from both our medical office and hospital segments investment products 

properties under lease we primarily generate revenue by leasing properties under longterm leases most of our rents and other earned income from leases are received under triplenet leases or leases that provide for a substantial recovery of operating expenses however some of our mobs and life science facility rents are structured under gross or modified gross leases accordingly for such gross or modified gross leases we incur certain property operating expenses such as real estate taxes repairs and maintenance property management fees utilities and insurance 

our ability to grow income from properties under lease depends in part on our ability to i increase rental income and other earned income from leases by increasing rental rates and occupancy levels ii maximize tenant recoveries and iii control nonrecoverable operating expenses most of our leases include contractual annual base rent escalation clauses that are either predetermined fixed increases andor are a function of an inflation index 

debt investments our mezzanine loans are generally secured by a pledge of ownership interests of an entity or entities which directly or indirectly own properties and are subordinate to more senior debt including mortgages and more senior mezzanine loans borrowers of our interests in mortgage and construction loans are typically healthcare providers and healthcare real estate generally secures these loans 

developments and redevelopments we generally commit to development projects that are at least 50 preleased or when we believe that market conditions will support speculative construction we work closely with our local real estate service providers including brokerage property management project management and construction management companies to assist us in evaluating development proposals and completing developments our development and redevelopment investments are primarily in our life science and medical office segments redevelopments are properties that require 

significant capital expenditures generally more than 25 of acquisition cost or existing basis to update achieve stabilization or to change the primary use of the properties 

investment management we coinvest in real estate properties with institutional investors through joint ventures structured as partnerships or limited liability companies we target institutional investors with longterm investment horizons who seek to benefit from our expertise in healthcare real estate predominantly we retain noncontrolling interests in the joint ventures ranging from 20 to 30 and serve as the managing member these ventures generally allow us to earn acquisition and asset management fees and have the potential for promoted interests or incentive distributions based on performance of the joint venture 

operating properties ridea we may enter into contracts with healthcare operators to manage communities that are placed in a structure permitted by the housing and economic recovery act of 2008 commonly referred to as ridea under the provisions of ridea a reit may lease qualified healthcare properties on an arms length basis to a taxable reit subsidiary trs if the property is operated on behalf of such subsidiary by a person who qualifies as an eligible independent contractor we view ridea as a structure primarily to be used on properties that present attractive valuation entry points and to drive growth by i transitioning the asset to a new operator that can bring scale operating efficiencies andor ancillary services or ii investing capital to reposition the asset

government regulation licensing and enforcement 

overview 

our tenants and operators are typically subject to extensive and complex federal state and local healthcare laws and regulations relating to fraud and abuse practices government reimbursement licensure and certificate of need and similar laws governing the operation of healthcare facilities and we expect that the healthcare industry in general will continue to face increased regulation and pressure in the areas of fraud waste and abuse cost control healthcare management and provision of services among others these regulations are wideranging and can subject our tenants and operators to civil criminal and administrative sanctions affected tenants and operators may find it increasingly difficult to comply with this complex and evolving regulatory environment because of a relative lack of guidance in many areas as certain of our healthcare properties are subject to oversight from several government agencies and the laws may vary from one jurisdiction to another changes in laws and regulations and reimbursement enforcement activity and regulatory noncompliance by our tenants and 

operators can all have a significant effect on their operations and financial condition which in turn may adversely impact us as detailed below and set forth under risk factors in item 1a 

based on information primarily provided by our tenants and operators excluding our medical office segment at december 31 2012 we estimate that approximately 18 and 14 of the annualized base rental payments received from our tenants and operators were dependent on medicare and medicaid reimbursement respectively 

the following is a discussion of certain laws and regulations generally applicable to our operators and in certain cases to us 

fraud and abuse enforcement 

there are various extremely complex federal and state laws and regulations governing healthcare providers relationships and arrangements and prohibiting fraudulent and abusive practices by such providers these laws include i federal and state false claims acts which among other things prohibit providers from filing false claims or making false statements to receive payment from medicare medicaid or other federal or state healthcare programs ii federal and state antikickback and feesplitting statutes including the medicare and medicaid antikickback statute which prohibit the payment or receipt of remuneration to induce referrals or recommendations of healthcare items or services iii federal and state physician selfreferral laws commonly referred to as the stark law which generally prohibit referrals by physicians to entities with which the physician or an immediate family member has a financial relationship iv the federal civil monetary penalties law which prohibits among other things the knowing presentation of a false or fraudulent claim for certain healthcare services and v federal and state privacy laws including the privacy and security rules contained in the health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 which provide for the privacy and security of personal health information violations of healthcare fraud and abuse laws carry civil criminal and administrative sanctions including punitive sanctions monetary penalties imprisonment denial of medicare and medicaid reimbursement and potential exclusion from medicare medicaid or other federal or state healthcare programs these laws are enforced by a variety of federal state and local agencies and can also be enforced by private litigants through among other things federal and state false claims acts which allow private litigants to bring qui tam or whistleblower actions many of our operators and tenants are subject to these laws and some of them may in the future become the subject of governmental enforcement actions if they fail to comply with applicable laws 

reimbursement 

sources of revenue for many of our tenants and operators include among other sources governmental healthcare programs such as the federal medicare program and state medicaid programs and nongovernmental payors such as insurance carriers and hmos as federal and state governments focus on healthcare reform initiatives and as the federal government and many states face significant budget deficits efforts to reduce costs by these payors will likely continue which may result in reduced or slower growth in reimbursement for certain services provided by some of our tenants and operators 

healthcare licensure and certificate of need 

certain healthcare facilities in our portfolio are subject to extensive federal state and local licensure certification and inspection laws and regulations in addition various licenses and permits are required to dispense narcotics operate pharmacies handle radioactive materials and operate equipment many states require certain healthcare providers to obtain a certificate of need which requires prior approval for the construction expansion and closure of certain healthcare facilities the 

approval process related to state certificate of need laws may impact some of our tenants and operators abilities to expand or change their businesses 

life science facilities 

while certain of our life science tenants include some wellestablished companies other such tenants are less established and in some cases may not yet have a product approved by the food and drug administration or other regulatory authorities for commercial sale creating a new pharmaceutical product or medical device requires substantial investments of time and money in part because of the extensive regulation of the healthcare industry it also entails considerable risk of failure in demonstrating that the product is safe and effective and in gaining regulatory approval and market acceptance 

senior housing entrance fee communities 

certain of the senior housing facilities mortgaged to or owned by us are operated as entrance fee communities generally an entrance fee is an upfront fee or consideration paid by a resident a portion of which may be refundable in exchange for some form of longterm benefit some of the entrance fee communities are subject to significant state regulatory oversight including for example oversight of each facilitys financial condition establishment and monitoring of reserve requirements and other financial restrictions the right of residents to cancel their contracts within a specified period of time lien rights in favor of the residents restrictions on change of ownership and similar matters 

americans with disabilities act the ada 

our properties must comply with the ada and any similar state or local laws to the extent that such properties are public accommodations as defined in those statutes the ada may require removal of barriers to access by persons with disabilities in certain public areas of our properties where such removal is readily achievable to date we have not received any notices of noncompliance with the ada that have caused us to incur substantial capital expenditures to address ada concerns should barriers to access by persons with disabilities be discovered at any of our properties we may be directly or indirectly responsible for additional costs that may be required to make facilities adacompliant noncompliance with the ada could result in the imposition of fines or an award of damages to private litigants the obligation to make readily achievable accommodations pursuant to the ada is an ongoing one and we continue to assess our properties and make modifications as appropriate in this respect 

environmental matters 

a wide variety of federal state and local environmental and occupational health and safety laws and regulations affect healthcare facility operations these complex federal and state statutes and their enforcement involve a myriad of regulations many of which involve strict liability on the part of the potential offender some of these federal and state statutes may directly impact us under various federal state and local environmental laws ordinances and regulations an owner of real property or a secured lender such as us may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of hazardous or toxic substances at under or disposed of in connection with such property as well as other potential costs relating to hazardous or toxic substances including government fines and damages for injuries to persons and adjacent property the cost of any required remediation removal fines or personal or property damages and the owners or secured lenders liability therefore could exceed or impair the value of the property andor the assets of the owner or secured lender in addition the presence of such substances or the failure to properly dispose of or remediate such substances may adversely affect the owners ability to sell or rent such property or to borrow using such property as collateral which in turn could reduce our revenues for a description of the risks associated with environmental matters see risk factors in item 1a of this report 




 item 1a risk factors 

  the section below discusses the most significant risk factors that may materially adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

as set forth below we believe that the risks facing our company generally fall into the following categories 

• risks related to our business and • risks related to tax matters including reitrelated risks risks related to our business 

volatility or disruption in the financial markets may impair our ability to raise capital obtain new financing or refinance existing obligations and fund real estate and development activities 

the global financial markets recently have experienced pervasive and fundamental disruptions while these conditions have stabilized since the first quarter of 2009 and the capital markets generally have shown signs of improvement the sustainability of an economic recovery is uncertain and additional levels of market disruption and volatility could materially adversely impact our ability to raise capital obtain new financing or refinance our existing obligations as they mature and fund real estate and development activities 

market volatility could also lead to significant uncertainty in the valuation of our investments and those of our joint ventures that may result in a substantial decrease in the value of our properties and those of our joint ventures as a result we may not be able to recover the carrying amount of such investments and the associated goodwill if any which may require us to recognize impairment charges in earnings 

we rely on external sources of capital to fund future capital needs and limitations on our access to such capital could have a materially adverse effect on our ability to meet commitments as they become due or make future investments necessary to grow our business 

we may not be able to fund all future capital needs from cash retained from operations if we are unable to obtain enough internal capital we may need to rely on external sources of capital including debt and equity financing to fulfill our capital requirements if we cannot access these external sources of capital we may not be able to make the investments needed to grow our business and to meet our obligations and commitments as they mature our access to capital depends upon a number of factors some of which we have little or no control over including but not limited to 

• general availability of credit and market conditions including rising interest rates and increased borrowing cost • the market price of the shares of our equity securities and the credit ratings of our debt and preferred securities • the markets perception of our growth potential and our current and potential future earnings and cash distributions • our degree of financial leverage and operational flexibility • the financial integrity of our lenders which might impair their ability to meet their commitments to us or their willingness to make additional loans to us and our inability to replace the financing commitment of any such lender on favorable terms or at all • the stability in the market value of our properties 13 

• the financial performance and general market perception of our operators tenants and borrowers • changes in the credit ratings on us government debt securities or default or delay in payment by the united states of its obligations and • issues facing the healthcare industry including but not limited to healthcare reform and changes in government reimbursement policies if our access to capital is limited by these factors or other factors it could have a material adverse impact on our ability to fund operations refinance our debt obligations fund dividend payments acquire properties and development activities 

adverse changes in our credit ratings could impair our ability to obtain additional debt and equity financing on favorable terms if at all and negatively impact the market price of our securities including our common stock 

the credit ratings of our senior unsecured debt are based on our operating performance liquidity and leverage ratios overall financial position and other factors employed by the credit rating agencies in their rating analyses of us our credit ratings can affect the amount and type of capital we can access as well as the terms of any financings we may obtain there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain our current credit ratings and in the event that our current credit ratings deteriorate we would likely incur higher borrowing costs and it may be more difficult or expensive to obtain additional financing or refinance existing obligations and commitments also a downgrade in our credit ratings would trigger additional costs or other potentially negative consequences under our current and future credit facilities and debt instruments 

our level of indebtedness may increase and materially adversely affect our future operations 

our outstanding indebtedness as of december 31 2012 was approximately 87 billion we may incur additional indebtedness in the future including in connection with the development or acquisition of assets which may be substantial any significant additional indebtedness could negatively affect the credit ratings of our debt and require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow to interest and principal payments due on our indebtedness greater demands on our cash resources may reduce funds available to us to pay dividends conduct development activities make capital expenditures and acquisitions or carry out other aspects of our business strategy increased indebtedness can also limit our ability to adjust rapidly to changing market conditions make us more vulnerable to general adverse economic and industry conditions and create competitive disadvantages for us compared to other companies with relatively lower debt levels increased future debt service obligations may limit our operational flexibility including our ability to finance or refinance our properties contribute properties to joint ventures or sell properties as needed 

covenants related to our indebtedness limit our operational flexibility and breaches of these covenants could materially adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

our unsecured credit facilities unsecured debt securities and secured debt and other indebtedness that we may incur in the future require or will require us to comply with a number of customary financial and other covenants such as maintaining certain levels of debt service coverage and leverage ratio tangible net worth requirements and maintaining reit status our continued ability to incur additional debt and to conduct business in general is subject to compliance with these financial and other covenants which limit our operational flexibility for example mortgages on our properties contain customary covenants such as those that limit or restrict our ability without the consent of the lender to further encumber or sell the applicable properties or to replace the applicable tenant or operator breaches of certain covenants may result in defaults under the mortgages on our properties 

and crossdefaults under certain of our other indebtedness even if we satisfy our payment obligations to the respective obligee additionally defaults under the leases or operating agreements related to mortgaged properties including defaults associated with the bankruptcy of the applicable tenant or operator may result in a default under the underlying mortgage and crossdefaults under certain of our other indebtedness covenants that limit our operational flexibility as well as defaults under our debt instruments could materially adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

an increase in interest rates could increase interest cost on new debt and could materially adversely impact our ability to refinance existing debt sell assets and limit our acquisition investment and development activities 

if interest rates increase so could our interest costs for any new debt this increased cost could make the financing of any acquisition and development activity more costly rising interest rates could limit our ability to refinance existing debt when it matures or cause us to pay higher interest rates upon refinancing and increase interest expense on refinanced indebtedness in addition an increase in interest rates could decrease the amount third parties are willing to pay for our assets thereby limiting our ability to reposition our portfolio promptly in response to changes in economic or other conditions 

we depend on a limited number of operators and tenants that account for a large percentage of our revenues 

during the year ended december 31 2012 approximately 48 of our revenues were generated by our leasing or financial arrangements with the following four companies hcr manorcare 30 emeritus 8 sunrise 5 and brookdale 5 the failure inability or unwillingness of these operators or tenants to meet their obligations to us could materially reduce our cash flow as well as our results of operations which could in turn reduce the amount of dividends we pay cause our stock price to decline and have other material adverse effects on our business results of operations and financial condition 

in addition any failure by these operators or tenants to effectively conduct their operations or to maintain and improve our properties could adversely affect their business reputation and their ability to attract and retain patients and residents in our properties which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition these operators and tenants generally have also agreed to indemnify defend and hold us harmless from and against various claims litigation and liabilities arising in connection with their respective businesses and we cannot provide any assurance that they will have sufficient assets income access to financing and insurance coverage to enable it to satisfy its indemnification obligations 

economic and other conditions that negatively affect geographic areas to which a greater percentage of our revenue is attributed could materially adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

for the year ended december 31 2012 approximately 44 of our revenue was derived from properties located in california 22 texas 12 and florida 10 as a result we are subject to increased exposure to adverse conditions affecting these regions including downturns in the local economies or changes in local real estate conditions increased competition or decreased demand and changes in statespecific legislation which could adversely affect our business and results of operations 

the bankruptcy insolvency or financial deterioration of one or more of our major operators or tenants may materially adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

we lease our properties directly to operators in most cases and in certain other cases we lease to thirdparty tenants who enter into longterm management agreements with operators to manage the 

properties although our leases financing arrangements and other agreements with our tenants and operators generally provide us the right under specified circumstances to terminate a lease evict an operator or tenant or demand immediate repayment of certain obligations to us the bankruptcy and insolvency laws afford certain rights to a party that has filed for bankruptcy or reorganization that may render certain of these remedies unenforceable or at the least delay our ability to pursue such remedies for example we cannot evict a tenant or operator solely because of its bankruptcy filing a debtor has the right to assume or to assume and assign to a third party or to reject its unexpired contracts in a bankruptcy proceeding if a debtor were to reject its leases with us our claim against the debtor for unpaid and future rents would be limited by the statutory cap set forth in the us bankruptcy code which may be substantially less than the remaining rent actually owed under the lease in addition the inability of our tenants or operators to make payments or comply with certain other lease obligations may affect our compliance with certain covenants contained in our debt securities credit facilities and the mortgages on the properties leased or managed by such tenants and operators in addition under certain conditions defaults under the underlying mortgages may result in crossdefault under our other indebtedness although we believe that we would be able to secure amendments under the applicable agreements in those circumstances the bankruptcy of an applicable operator or tenant may potentially result in less favorable borrowing terms than currently available delays in the availability of funding or other material adverse consequences in addition many of our facilities are leased to healthcare providers who provide longterm custodial care to the elderly evicting such operators for failure to pay rent while the facility is occupied may be a difficult and slow process and may not be successful 

our operators and tenants may not procure the necessary insurance to adequately insure against losses 

our leases generally require our tenants and operators to secure and maintain comprehensive liability and property insurance that covers us as well as the tenants and operators some types of losses may not be adequately insured by our tenants and operators should an uninsured loss or a loss in excess of insured limits occur we could incur liability or lose all or a portion of the capital we have invested in a property as well as the anticipated future revenues from the property in such an event we might nevertheless remain obligated for any mortgage debt or other financial obligations related to the property we continually review the insurance maintained by our tenants and operators and believe the coverage provided to be customary for similarly situated companies in our industry however we cannot assure you that material uninsured losses or losses in excess of insurance proceeds will not occur in the future 

our operators and tenants are faced with litigation and may experience rising liability and insurance costs 

in some states advocacy groups have been created to monitor the quality of care at healthcare facilities and these groups have brought litigation against the operators and tenants of such facilities also in several instances private litigation by patients has succeeded in winning large damage awards for alleged abuses the effect of this litigation and other potential litigation may materially increase the costs incurred by our operators and tenants for monitoring and reporting quality of care compliance in addition their cost of liability and medical malpractice insurance can be significant and may increase so long as the present healthcare litigation environment continues cost increases could cause our operators to be unable to make their lease or mortgage payments or fail to purchase the appropriate liability and malpractice insurance potentially decreasing our revenues and increasing our collection and litigation costs in addition as a result of our ownership of healthcare facilities we may be named as a defendant in lawsuits allegedly arising from the actions of our operators or tenants for which claims such operators and tenants have agreed to indemnify defend and hold us harmless from and against but which may require unanticipated expenditures on our part 

operators and tenants that fail to comply with the requirements of or changes to governmental reimbursement programs such as medicare or medicaid may cease to operate or be unable to meet their financial and other contractual obligations to us 

certain of our operators and tenants are affected by an extremely complex set of federal state and local laws and regulations that are subject to frequent and substantial changes sometimes applied retroactively resulting from legislation adoption of rules and regulations and administrative and judicial interpretations of existing law see item 1—business—government regulation licensing and enforcement above for example to the extent that any of our operators or tenants receive a significant portion of their revenues from governmental payors primarily medicare and medicaid such revenues may be subject to 

• statutory and regulatory changes • retroactive rate adjustments • recovery of program overpayments or setoffs • administrative rulings • policy interpretations • payment or other delays by fiscal intermediaries or carriers • government funding restrictions at a program level or with respect to specific facilities and • interruption or delays in payments due to any ongoing governmental investigations and audits at such property in recent years governmental payors have frozen or reduced payments to healthcare providers due to budgetary pressures healthcare reimbursement will likely continue to be of significant importance to federal and state authorities we cannot make any assessment as to the ultimate timing or the effect that any future legislative reforms may have on our operators and tenants costs of doing business and on the amount of reimbursement by government and other thirdparty payors the failure of any of our operators or tenants to comply with these laws requirements and regulations could materially adversely affect their ability to meet their financial and contractual obligations to us 

legislation to address the federal governments projected operating deficit could have a material adverse effect on our operators liquidity financial condition or results of operations 

congress may consider legislation to address the fiscal condition of the united states that may include entitlement reform tax reform reductions in domestic discretionary spending budget sequestration of certain nondefense discretionary federal programs and an increase in the national debt limit that could have a material adverse effect on our operators liquidity financial condition or results of operations in particular congress may consider legislation affecting the funding of entitlement programs such as medicare medicaid and medicare advantage plans that may result in reductions in funding and reimbursements to providers tax reform that may impact corporate and individual tax rates and retirement plans and an increase in the federal debt limit that may have an impact on credit markets additionally the administration may implement proposals under current law or legislation that may be approved by congress that could modify the delivery of services and benefits under medicare medicaid or medicare advantage plans such changes could have a material adverse effect on our operators liquidity financial condition or results of operations which could adversely affect their ability to satisfy their obligations to us and could have a material adverse effect on us 

operators and tenants that fail to comply with federal state and local licensure certification and inspection laws and regulations may cease to operate or be unable to meet their financial and other contractual obligations to us 

certain of our operators and tenants are subject to extensive federal state local and industryrelated licensure certification and inspection laws regulations and standards our operators or tenants failure to comply with any of these laws regulations or standards could result in loss of accreditation denial of reimbursement imposition of fines suspension or decertification from federal and state healthcare programs loss of license or closure of the facility for example certain of our properties may require a license registration andor certificate of need to operate failure of any operator or tenant to obtain a license registration or certificate of need or loss of a required license registration or certificate of need would prevent a facility from operating in the manner intended by such operator or tenant additionally failure of our operators and tenants to generally comply with applicable laws and regulations may have an adverse effect on facilities owned by or mortgaged to us and therefore may materially adversely impact us see item 1—business—government regulation licensing and enforcement—healthcare licensure and certificate of need above 

increased competition as well as an inability to grow revenues as originally forecast have resulted and may further result in lower net revenues for some of our operators and tenants and may affect their ability to meet their financial and other contractual obligations to us 

the healthcare industry is highly competitive and can become more competitive in the future the occupancy levels at and rental income from our facilities is dependent on our ability and the ability of our operators and tenants to maintain and increase such levels and income and to compete with entities that have substantial capital resources these entities compete with other operators and tenants on a number of different levels including the quality of care provided reputation the physical appearance of a facility price the range of services offered family preference alternatives for healthcare delivery the supply of competing properties physicians staff referral sources location and the size and demographics of the population in the surrounding area private federal and state payment programs and the effect of laws and regulations may also have a significant influence on the profitability of the properties and their tenants our operators and tenants also compete with numerous other companies providing similar healthcare services or alternatives such as home health agencies life care at home communitybased service programs retirement communities and convalescent centers such competition which has intensified due to overbuilding in some segments in which we invest has caused the occupancy rate of newly constructed buildings to slow and the monthly rate that many newly built and previously existing facilities were able to obtain for their services to decrease we cannot be certain that the operators and tenants of all of our facilities will be able to achieve occupancy and rate levels that will enable them to meet all of their obligations to us further many competing companies may have resources and attributes that are superior to those of our operators and tenants thus our operators and tenants may encounter increased competition in the future that could limit their ability to maintain or attract residents or expand their businesses which could materially adversely affect their ability to meet their financial and other contractual obligations to us potentially decreasing our revenues impairing our assets and increasing our collection and dispute costs 

our tenants in the life science industry face high levels of regulation expense and uncertainty 

life science tenants particularly those involved in developing and marketing pharmaceutical products are subject to certain unique risks as follows 

• some of our tenants require significant outlays of funds for the research development and clinical testing of their products and technologies if private investors the government or other sources of funding are unavailable to support such activities a tenants business may be adversely affected or fail 18 

• the research development clinical testing manufacture and marketing of some of our tenants products require federal state and foreign regulatory approvals which may be costly or difficult to obtain • even after a life science tenant gains regulatory approval and market acceptance the product may still present significant regulatory and liability risks including among others the possible later discovery of safety concerns competition from new products and ultimately the expiration of patent protection for the product • our tenants with marketable products may be adversely affected by healthcare reform and the reimbursement policies of government or private healthcare payors and • our tenants may be unable to adequately protect their intellectual property under patent copyright or trade secret laws we cannot assure you that our life science tenants will be successful in their businesses if our tenants businesses are adversely affected they may have difficulty making payments to us which could materially adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

we may be unable to successfully foreclose on the collateral securing our real estaterelated loans and even if we are successful in our foreclosure efforts we may be unable to successfully operate occupy or reposition the underlying real estate which may adversely affect our ability to recover our investments 

if an operator or tenant defaults under one of our mortgages or mezzanine loans we may have to foreclose on the loan or protect our interest by acquiring title to the collateral and thereafter making substantial improvements or repairs in order to maximize the propertys investment potential in some cases as noted above the collateral consists of the equity interests in an entity that directly or indirectly owns the applicable real property or interests in operating facilities and accordingly we may not have full recourse to assets of that entity operators tenants or borrowers may contest enforcement of foreclosure or other remedies seek bankruptcy protection against our exercise of enforcement or other remedies andor bring claims for lender liability in response to actions to enforce mortgage obligations foreclosurerelated costs high loantovalue ratios or declines in the value of the facility may prevent us from realizing an amount equal to our mortgage or mezzanine loan upon foreclosure and we may be required to record valuation allowance for such losses even if we are able to successfully foreclose on the collateral securing our real estaterelated loans we may inherit properties for which we may be unable to expeditiously seek tenants or operators if at all which would adversely affect our ability to fully recover our investment 

required regulatory approvals can delay or prohibit transfers of our healthcare facilities 

transfers of healthcare facilities to successor tenants or operators may be subject to regulatory approvals or ratifications including but not limited to change of ownership approvals under certificate of need laws and medicare and medicaid provider arrangements that are not required for transfers of other types of commercial operations and other types of real estate the replacement of any tenant or operator could be delayed by the regulatory approval process of any federal state or local government agency necessary for the transfer of the facility or the replacement of the operator licensed to manage the facility if we are unable to find a suitable replacement tenant or operator upon favorable terms or at all we may take possession of a facility which might expose us to successor liability or require us to indemnify subsequent operators to whom we might transfer the operating rights and licenses all of which may materially adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

competition may make it difficult to identify and purchase or develop suitable healthcare facilities to grow our investment portfolio 

we face significant competition from other reits investment companies private equity and hedge fund investors sovereign funds healthcare operators lenders developers and other institutional investors some of whom may have greater resources and lower costs of capital than we do increased competition makes it more challenging for us to identify and successfully capitalize on opportunities that meet our business goals and could improve the bargaining power of property owners seeking to sell thereby impeding our investment acquisition and development activities if we cannot capitalize on our development pipeline identify and purchase a sufficient quantity of healthcare facilities at favorable prices or if we are unable to finance acquisitions on commercially favorable terms our business results of operations and financial condition may be materially adversely affected 

we may be required to incur substantial renovation costs to make certain of our healthcare properties suitable for other operators and tenants 

healthcare facilities are typically highly customized and may not be easily adapted to nonhealthcarerelated uses the improvements generally required to conform a property to healthcare use such as upgrading electrical gas and plumbing infrastructure are costly and at times tenantspecific a new or replacement operator or tenant may require different features in a property depending on that operators or tenants particular operations if a current operator or tenant is unable to pay rent and vacates a property we may incur substantial expenditures to modify a property before we are able to secure another operator or tenant also if the property needs to be renovated to accommodate multiple operators or tenants we may incur substantial expenditures before we are able to release the space these expenditures or renovations may materially adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

we face additional risks associated with property development that can render a project less profitable or not profitable at all and under certain circumstances prevent completion of development activities once undertaken 

largescale groundup development of healthcare properties presents additional risks for us including risks that 

• a development opportunity may be abandoned after expending significant resources resulting in the loss of deposits or failure to recover expenses already incurred • the development and construction costs of a project may exceed original estimates due to increased interest rates and higher materials transportation labor leasing or other costs which could make the completion of the development project less profitable • construction andor permanent financing may not be available on favorable terms or at all • the project may not be completed on schedule which can result in increases in construction costs and debt service expenses as a result of a variety of factors that are beyond our control including natural disasters labor conditions material shortages regulatory hurdles civil unrest and acts of war and • occupancy rates and rents at a newly completed property may not meet expected levels and could be insufficient to make the property profitable these risks could result in substantial unanticipated delays or expenses and under certain circumstances could prevent completion of development activities once undertaken any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

our use of joint ventures may limit our flexibility with jointly owned investments 

we have and may continue in the future to develop andor acquire properties in joint ventures with other persons or entities when circumstances warrant the use of these structures our participation in joint ventures is subject to risks that may not be present with other methods of ownership including 

• we could experience an impasse on certain decisions because we do not have sole decisionmaking authority which could require us to expend additional resources on resolving such impasses or potential disputes including litigation or arbitration • our joint venture partners could have investment goals that are not consistent with our investment objectives including the timing terms and strategies for any investments • our ability to transfer our interest in a joint venture to a third party may be restricted • our joint venture partners might become bankrupt fail to fund their share of required capital contributions or fail to fulfill their obligations as a joint venture partner which may require us to infuse our own capital into the venture on behalf of the partner despite other competing uses for such capital and • our joint venture partners may have competing interests in our markets that could create conflict of interest issues from time to time we acquire other companies and if we are unable to successfully integrate these operations our business results of operations and financial condition may be materially adversely affected 

acquisitions require the integration of companies that have previously operated independently successful integration of the operations of these companies depends primarily on our ability to consolidate operations systems procedures properties and personnel and to eliminate redundancies and costs we may encounter difficulties in these integrations potential difficulties associated with 

acquisitions include the loss of key employees the disruption of our ongoing business or that of the acquired entity possible inconsistencies in standards controls procedures and policies and the assumption of unexpected liabilities including 

• liabilities relating to the cleanup or remediation of undisclosed environmental conditions • unasserted claims of vendors or other persons dealing with the seller • liabilities claims and litigation whether or not incurred in the ordinary course of business relating to periods prior to our acquisition • claims for indemnification by general partners directors officers and others indemnified by the seller and • liabilities for taxes relating to periods prior to our acquisition in addition the acquired companies and their properties may fail to perform as expected including in respect of estimated cost savings inaccurate assumptions regarding future rental or occupancy rates could result in overly optimistic estimates of future revenues similarly we may underestimate future operating expenses or the costs necessary to bring properties up to standards established for their intended use if we have difficulties with any of these areas or if we later discover additional liabilities or experience unforeseen costs relating to our acquired companies we might not achieve the economic benefits we expect from our acquisitions and this may materially adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

from time to time we have made and in the future we may seek to make one or more material acquisitions which may involve the expenditure of significant funds 

we regularly review potential transactions in order to maximize shareholder value and believe that currently there are available a number of acquisition opportunities that would be complementary to our business given the recent industry consolidation trend in connection with our review of such transactions we regularly engage in discussions with potential acquisition candidates some of which are material any future acquisitions could require the issuance of securities the incurrence of debt assumption of contingent liabilities or incurrence of significant expenditures any of which could materially adversely impact our business financial condition or results of operations in addition the financing required for such acquisitions may not be available on commercially favorable terms or at all 

loss of our key personnel could temporarily disrupt our operations and adversely affect us 

we are dependent on the efforts of our executive officers and competition for these individuals is intense although our chief executive officer chief financial officer chief investment officer and general counsel have employment agreements with us we cannot assure you that they will remain employed with us the loss or limited availability of the services of any of our executive officers or our inability to recruit and retain qualified personnel in the future could at least temporarily have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition and be negatively perceived in the capital markets 

unfavorable resolution of litigation matters and disputes could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition 

from time to time we are involved in legal proceedings lawsuits and other claims we may also be named as defendants in lawsuits allegedly arising out of our actions or the actions of our operators and tenants in which such operators and tenants have agreed to indemnify defend and hold us harmless from and against various claims litigation and liabilities arising in connection with their respective businesses an unfavorable resolution of litigation may have a material adverse effect on our 

business results of operations and financial condition regardless of its outcome litigation may result in substantial costs and expenses and significantly divert the attention of management there can be no assurance that we will be able to prevail in or achieve a favorable settlement of litigation in addition litigation government proceedings or environmental matters could lead to increased costs or interruption of our normal business operations 

we may experience uninsured or underinsured losses which could result in a significant loss of the capital we have invested in a property decrease anticipated future revenues or cause us to incur unanticipated expense 

we maintain comprehensive insurance coverage on our properties with terms conditions limits and deductibles that we believe are adequate and appropriate given the relative risk and costs of such coverage and we continually review the insurance maintained by us however a large number of our properties are located in areas exposed to earthquake windstorm flood and other natural disasters and may be subject to other losses in particular our life science portfolio is concentrated in areas known to be subject to earthquake activity while we purchase insurance for earthquake windstorm flood and other natural disasters that we believe is adequate in light of current industry practice and analysis prepared by outside consultants there is no assurance that such insurance will fully cover such losses these losses can decrease our anticipated revenues from a property and result in the loss of all or a portion of the capital we have invested in a property the insurance market for such exposures can be very volatile and we may be unable to purchase the limits and terms we desire on a commercially reasonable basis in the future in addition there are certain exposures where insurance is not purchased as we do not believe it is economically feasible to do so or where there is no viable insurance market 

environmental compliance costs and liabilities associated with our real estate related investments may materially impair the value of those investments 

under various federal state and local laws ordinances and regulations as a current or previous owner of real estate we may be required to investigate and clean up certain hazardous or toxic substances or petroleum released at a property and may be held liable to a governmental entity or to third parties for property damage and for investigation and cleanup costs incurred by the third parties in connection with the contamination in addition some environmental laws create a lien on the contaminated site in favor of the government for damages and the costs it incurs in connection with the contamination although we i currently carry environmental insurance on our properties in an amount and subject to deductibles that we believe are commercially reasonable and ii generally require our operators and tenants to undertake to indemnify us for environmental liabilities they cause such liabilities could exceed the amount of our insurance the financial ability of the tenant or operator to indemnify us or the value of the contaminated property the presence of contamination or the failure to remediate contamination may materially adversely affect our ability to sell or lease the real estate or to borrow using the real estate as collateral as the owner of a site we may also be held liable under common law to third parties for damages and injuries resulting from environmental contamination emanating from the site although we are generally indemnified by the current operators or tenants of our properties for contamination caused by them these indemnities may not adequately cover all environmental costs we may also experience environmental liabilities arising from conditions not known to us 

the impact of the comprehensive healthcare regulation enacted in 2010 on us and operators and tenants cannot accurately be predicted 

legislative proposals are introduced or proposed in congress and in some state legislatures each year that would affect major changes in the healthcare system either nationally or at the state level 

notably in march 2010 president obama signed into law the patient protection and affordable care act along with the health care and education reconciliation act of 2010 collectively the affordable care act the passage of the affordable care act has resulted in comprehensive reform legislation that is expected to expand healthcare coverage to millions of currently uninsured people beginning in 2014 and provide for significant changes to the us healthcare system over the next ten years to help fund this expansion the affordable care act outlines certain reductions in medicare reimbursements for various healthcare providers including longterm acute care hospitals and skilled nursing facilities as well as certain other changes to medicare payment methodologies this comprehensive healthcare legislation provides for extensive future rulemaking by regulatory authorities and also may be altered or amended we cannot accurately predict whether any pending legislative proposals will be adopted or if adopted what effect if any these proposals would have on our operators and tenants and thus our business similarly while we can anticipate that some of the rulemaking that will be promulgated by regulatory authorities will affect our operators and tenants and the manner in which they are reimbursed by the federal healthcare programs we cannot accurately predict today the impact of those regulations on our operators and tenants and thus on our business 

the supreme courts decision upholding the constitutionality of the individual mandate while striking down the provisions linking federal funding of state medicaid programs with a federally mandated expansion of those programs has not reduced the uncertain impact that the law will have on healthcare delivery systems over the next decade we can expect that the federal authorities will continue to implement the law but because of the courts mixed ruling the implementation will take longer than originally expected with a commensurate increase in the period of uncertainty regarding the laws full long term financial impact on the delivery of and payment for healthcare 

risk related to tax including reitrelated risks 

loss of our tax status as a reit would substantially reduce our available funds and would have material adverse consequences for us and the value of our common stock 

qualification as a reit involves the application of numerous highly technical and complex provisions of the internal revenue code of 1986 as amended the code for which there are only limited judicial and administrative interpretations as well as the determination of various factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control we intend to continue to operate in a manner that enables us to qualify as a reit however our qualification and taxation as a reit depend upon our ability to meet through actual annual operating results asset diversification distribution levels and diversity of stock ownership the various qualification tests imposed under the code for example to qualify as a reit at least 95 of our gross income in any year must be derived from qualifying sources and we must make distributions to our stockholders aggregating annually at least 90 of our reit taxable income excluding net capital gains in addition new legislation regulations administrative interpretations or court decisions could change the tax laws or interpretations of the tax laws regarding qualification as a reit or the federal income tax consequences of that qualification in a manner that is materially adverse to our stockholders accordingly there is no assurance that we have operated or will continue to operate in a manner so as to qualify or remain qualified as a reit 

if we lose our reit status we will face serious tax consequences that will substantially reduce the funds available to make payments of principal and interest on the debt securities we issue and to make distributions to stockholders if we fail to qualify as a reit 

• we will not be allowed a deduction for distributions to stockholders in computing our taxable income • we will be subject to corporatelevel income tax including any applicable alternative minimum tax on our taxable income at regular corporate rates 24 

• we could be subject to increased state and local income taxes and • unless we are entitled to relief under relevant statutory provisions we will be disqualified from taxation as a reit for the four taxable years following the year during which we fail to qualify as a reit as a result of all these factors our failure to qualify as a reit also could impair our ability to expand our business and raise capital and could materially adversely affect the value of our common stock 

we could have potential deferred and contingent tax liabilities from corporate acquisitions that could limit delay or impede future sales of our properties 

if during the tenyear period beginning on the date we acquire certain companies we recognize gain on the disposition of any property acquired then to the extent of the excess of i the fair market value of such property as of the acquisition date over ii our adjusted income tax basis in such property as of that date we will be required to pay a corporatelevel federal income tax on this gain at the highest regular corporate rate there can be no assurance that these triggering dispositions will not occur and these requirements could limit delay or impede future sales of our properties 

in addition the irs may assert liabilities against us for corporate income taxes for taxable years prior to the time that we acquire certain companies in which case we will owe these taxes plus interest and penalties if any 

there are uncertainties relating to the calculation of nonreit tax earnings and profits ep in certain acquisitions which may require us to distribute ep 

in order to remain qualified as a reit we are required to distribute to our stockholders all of the accumulated nonreit ep of certain companies that we acquire prior to the close of the first taxable year in which the acquisition occurs failure to make such ep distributions would result in our disqualification as a reit the determination of the amount to be distributed in such ep distributions is a complex factual and legal determination we may have less than complete information at the time we undertake our analysis or we may interpret the applicable law differently from the irs we currently believe that we have satisfied the requirements relating to such ep distributions there are however substantial uncertainties relating to the determination of ep including the possibility that the irs could successfully assert that the taxable income of the companies acquired should be increased which would increase our nonreit ep moreover an audit of the acquired company following our acquisition could result in an increase in accumulated nonreit ep which could require us to pay an additional taxable distribution to our thenexisting stockholders if we qualify under rules for curing this type of default or could result in our disqualification as a reit 

thus we might fail to satisfy the requirement that we distribute all of our nonreit ep by the close of the first taxable year in which the acquisition occurs moreover although there are procedures available to cure a failure to distribute all of our ep we cannot now determine whether we will be able to take advantage of these procedures or the economic impact on us of doing so 

our charter contains ownership limits with respect to our common stock and other classes of capital stock 

our charter contains restrictions on the ownership and transfer of our common stock and preferred stock that are intended to assist us in preserving our qualification as a reit under our charter subject to certain exceptions no person or entity may own actually or constructively more than 98 by value or by number of shares whichever is more restrictive of the outstanding shares of our common stock or any class or series of our preferred stock 

additionally our charter has a 99 ownership limitation on the direct or indirect ownership of our voting shares which may include common stock or other classes of capital stock our board of directors in its sole discretion may exempt a proposed transferee from either ownership limit the ownership limits may delay defer or prevent a transaction or a change of control that might involve a premium price for our common stock or might otherwise be in the best interests of our stockholders 

we are subject to certain provisions of maryland law and our charter relating to business combinations 

the maryland business combination act provides that unless exempted a maryland corporation may not engage in business combinations including a merger consolidation share exchange or in circumstances specified in the statute an asset transfer or issuance or reclassification of equity securities with an interested stockholder or an affiliate of an interested stockholder for five years after the most recent date on which the interested stockholder became an interested stockholder and thereafter unless specified criteria are met an interested stockholder is generally a person owning or controlling directly or indirectly 10 or more of the voting power of the outstanding voting stock of a maryland corporation unless our board of directors takes action to exempt us generally or with respect to certain transactions from this statute in the future the maryland business combination act will be applicable to business combinations between us and other persons 

in addition to the restrictions on business combinations contained in the maryland business combination act our charter also contains restrictions on business combinations our charter requires that except in certain circumstances business combinations including a merger or consolidation and certain asset transfers and issuances of securities with a related person including a beneficial owner of 10 or more of our outstanding voting stock be approved by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 90 of our outstanding voting stock 

the restrictions on business combinations provided under maryland law and contained in our charter may delay defer or prevent a change of control or other transaction even if such transaction involves a premium price for our common stock or our stockholders believe that such transaction is otherwise in their best interests

we are organized to invest in incomeproducing healthcarerelated facilities in evaluating potential investments we consider a multitude of factors including 

• location construction quality age condition and design of the property • geographic area proximity to other healthcare facilities type of property and demographic profile • whether the expected riskadjusted return exceeds our cost of capital • whether the rent or operating income provides a competitive market return to our investors • duration rental rates operator and tenant quality and other attributes of inplace leases including master lease structures • current and anticipated cash flow and its adequacy to meet our operational needs • availability of security such as letters of credit security deposits and guarantees • potential for capital appreciation 26 

• expertise and reputation of the operator or tenant • occupancy and demand for similar healthcare facilities in the same or nearby communities • the mix of revenues generated at healthcare facilities between privatelypaid and government reimbursed • availability of qualified operators or property managers and whether we can manage the property • potential alternative uses of the facilities • the regulatory and reimbursement environment in which the properties operate • tax laws related to reits • prospects for liquidity through financing or refinancing and • our access to and cost of capital the following summarizes our property and direct financing lease dfl investments as of and for the year ended december 31 2012 square feet and dollars in thousands

the information set forth in this item 7 is intended to provide readers with an understanding of our financial condition changes in financial condition and results of operations we will discuss and provide our analysis in the following order 

• executive summary • 2012 transaction overview • dividends • critical accounting policies • results of operations • liquidity and capital resources • nongaap financial measure—funds from operations • offbalance sheet arrangements • contractual obligations • inflation • recent accounting pronouncements executive summary 

we are a selfadministered reit that together with our unconsolidated joint ventures invests primarily in real estate serving the healthcare industry in the us we acquire develop lease manage and dispose of healthcare real estate and provide financing to healthcare providers at december 31 2012 our portfolio of investments including properties owned by our investment management platform consisted of interests in 1160 facilities 

our business strategy is based on three principles i opportunistic investing ii portfolio diversification and iii conservative financing we actively redeploy capital from investments with lower return potential or shorter investment horizons into assets representing longer term investments with attractive risk adjusted return potential we make investments where the expected riskadjusted 

return exceeds our cost of capital and strive to capitalize on our operator tenant and other business relationships to grow our business 

our strategy contemplates acquiring and developing properties on terms that are favorable to us generally we prefer larger more complex private transactions that leverage our management teams experience and our infrastructure we follow a disciplined approach to enhancing the value of our existing portfolio including ongoing evaluation of potential disposition of properties that no longer fit our strategy 

we primarily generate revenue by leasing healthcare properties under longterm leases with fixed andor inflation indexed escalators most of our rents and other earned income from leases are received under triplenet leases or leases that provide for substantial recovery of operating expenses however some of our medical office and life science leases are structured as gross or modified gross leases operating expenses are generally related to mob and life science leased properties and senior housing properties managed on our behalf ridea properties accordingly for such mobs life science facilities and ridea properties we incur certain property operating expenses such as real estate taxes repairs and maintenance property management fees utilities employee costs for resident care and insurance our growth for these assets depends in part on our ability to i increase rental income and other earned income from leases by increasing rental rates and occupancy levels ii maximize tenant recoveries given underlying lease structures and iii control operating and other expenses our operations are impacted by property specific market specific general economic and other conditions at december 31 2012 the contractual maturities in our portfolio of leased assets were 13 through 2015 measured in dollars of expiring base rents 

access to capital markets impacts our cost of capital and ability to refinance maturing indebtedness as well as to fund future acquisitions and development through the issuance of additional securities or secured debt access to external capital on favorable terms is critical to the success of our strategy

critical accounting policies 

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap requires our management to use judgment in the application of accounting policies including making estimates and assumptions we base estimates on the best information available to us at the time our experience and on various other assumptions believed to be reasonable under the circumstances these estimates affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods if our judgment or interpretation of the facts and circumstances relating to various transactions or other matters had been different it is possible that different accounting would have been applied resulting in a different presentation of our consolidated financial statements from time to time we reevaluate our estimates and assumptions in the event estimates or assumptions prove to be different from actual results adjustments are made in subsequent periods to reflect more current estimates and assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain for a more detailed discussion of our significant accounting policies see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements below is a discussion of accounting policies that we consider critical in that they may require complex judgment in their application or require estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain 

principles of consolidation 

the consolidated financial statements include the accounts of hcp inc our wholly owned subsidiaries and joint ventures that we control through voting rights or other means we consolidate investments in variable interest entities vies when we are the primary beneficiary of the vie at i the inception of the variable interest entity ii as a result of a change in circumstance identified during our continuous review of our vie relationships or iii upon the occurrence of a qualifying reconsideration event 

we make judgments with respect to our level of influence or control of an entity and whether we are or are not the primary beneficiary of a vie consideration of various factors includes but is not limited to our ability to direct the activities that most significantly impact the entitys economic performance our form of ownership interest our representation on the entitys governing body the size and seniority of our investment our ability and the rights of other investors to participate in policy making decisions replace the manager andor liquidate the entity if applicable our ability to correctly assess our influence or control over an entity when determining the primary beneficiary of a vie 

affects the presentation of these entities in our consolidated financial statements if we perform a primary beneficiary analysis at a date other than at inception of the variable interest entity our assumptions may be different and may result in the identification of a different primary beneficiary 

if we determine that we are the primary beneficiary of a vie our consolidated financial statements would include the operating results of the vie either tenant or borrower rather than the results of the variable interest in the vie we would depend on the vie to provide us timely financial information and rely on the internal control of the vie to provide accurate financial information if the vie has deficiencies in its internal control over financial reporting or does not provide us with timely financial information this may adversely impact the quality andor timing of our financial reporting and our internal control over financial reporting 

revenue recognition 

we recognize rental revenue on a straightline basis over the lease term when collectibility is reasonably assured and the tenant has taken possession or controls the physical use of the leased asset for assets acquired subject to leases we recognize revenue upon acquisition of the asset provided the tenant has taken possession or controls the physical use of the leased asset if the lease provides for tenant improvements we determine whether the tenant improvements for accounting purposes are owned by the tenant or us when we are the owner of the tenant improvements the tenant is not considered to have taken physical possession or have control of the physical use of the leased asset until the tenant improvements are substantially completed when the tenant is the owner of the tenant improvements any tenant improvement allowance funded is treated as a lease incentive and amortized as a reduction of revenue over the lease term the determination of ownership of the tenant improvements is subject to significant judgment if our assessment of the owner of the tenant improvements for accounting purposes were to change the timing and amount of our revenue recognized would be impacted 

certain leases provide for additional rents contingent upon a percentage of the facilitys revenue in excess of specified base amounts or other thresholds such revenue is recognized when actual results reported by the tenant or estimates of tenant results exceed the base amount or other thresholds the recognition of additional rents requires us to make estimates of amounts owed and to a certain extent are dependent on the accuracy of the facility results reported to us our estimates may differ from actual results which could be material to our consolidated financial statements 

we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts including an allowance for straightline rent receivables for estimated losses resulting from tenant defaults or the inability of tenants to make contractual rent and tenant recovery payments we monitor the liquidity and creditworthiness of our tenants and operators on an ongoing basis this evaluation considers industry and economic conditions property performance credit enhancements and other factors for straightline rent amounts our assessment is based on income recoverable over the term of the lease we exercise judgment in establishing allowances and consider payment history and current credit status in developing these estimates these estimates may differ from actual results which could be material to our consolidated financial statements 

loans receivable are classified as heldforinvestment based on managements intent and ability to hold the loans for the foreseeable future or to maturity we recognize interest income on loans including the amortization of discounts and premiums using the interest method applied on a loanbyloan basis when collectibility of the future payments is reasonably assured premiums discounts and related costs are recognized as yield adjustments over the life of the related loans 

we use the direct finance method of accounting to record income from dfls for leases accounted for as dfls future minimum lease payments are recorded as a receivable the difference between the future minimum lease payments and the estimated residual values less the cost of the 

properties is recorded as unearned income unearned income is deferred and amortized to income over the lease terms to provide a constant yield when collectibility of the lease payments is reasonably assured investments in dfls are presented net of unamortized unearned income the determination of estimated useful lives and residual values are subject to significant judgment if our assessments for accounting purposes were to change the timing and amount of our revenue recognized would be impacted 

loans and dfls are placed on nonaccrual status at such time as management determines that collectibility of contractual amounts is not reasonably assured while on nonaccrual status loans or dfls are either accounted for on a cash basis in which income is recognized only upon receipt of cash or on a costrecovery basis in which all cash receipts reduce the carrying value of the loan or dfl based on managements judgment of collectibility 

allowances are established for loans and dfls based upon a probable loss estimate for individual loans and dfls deemed to be impaired loans and dfls are impaired when it is deemed probable that we will be unable to collect all amounts due on a timely basis in accordance with the contractual terms of the loan or lease determining the adequacy of the allowance is complex and requires significant judgment by us about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain the allowance is based upon our assessment of the borrowers or lessees overall financial condition resources and payment record the prospects for support from any financially responsible guarantors and if appropriate the realizable value of any collateral these estimates consider all available evidence including as appropriate the present value of the expected future cash flows discounted at the loans or dfls effective interest rate the fair value of collateral general economic conditions and trends historical and industry loss experience and other relevant factors while our assumptions are based in part upon historical data our estimates may differ from actual results which could be material to our consolidated financial statements 

real estate 

we make estimates as part of our allocation of the purchase price of acquisitions to the various components of the acquisition based upon the relative fair value of each component the most significant components of our allocations are typically the allocation of fair value to the buildings asifvacant land and inplace leases in the case of the fair value of buildings and the allocation of value to land and other intangibles our estimates of the values of these components will affect the amount of depreciation and amortization we record over the estimated useful life of the property acquired or the remaining lease term in the case of the value of inplace leases we make our best estimates based on our evaluation of the specific characteristics of each tenants lease factors considered include estimates of carrying costs during hypothetical expected leaseup periods market conditions and costs to execute similar leases our assumptions affect the amount of future revenue that we will recognize over the remaining lease term for the acquired inplace leases 

a variety of costs are incurred in the development and leasing of properties after determination is made to capitalize a cost it is allocated to the specific component of a project that is benefited determination of when a development project is substantially complete and capitalization must cease involves a degree of judgment the costs of land and buildings under development include specifically identifiable costs the capitalized costs include preconstruction costs essential to the development of the property development costs construction costs interest costs real estate taxes and other costs incurred during the period of development we consider a construction project as substantially completed and held available for occupancy and cease capitalization of costs upon the completion of the related tenant improvements 

impairment of longlived assets and goodwill 

we assess the carrying value of our real estate assets and related intangibles real estate assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable recoverability of real estate assets is measured by comparison of the carrying amount of the asset or asset group to the respective estimated future undiscounted cash flows in order to review our real estate assets for recoverability we consider market conditions as well as our intent with respect to holding or disposing of the asset fair value is determined through various valuation techniques including discounted cash flow models quoted market values and third party appraisals where considered necessary if our analysis indicates that the carrying value of the real estate asset is not recoverable on an undiscounted cash flow basis we recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the real estate asset 

goodwill is tested for impairment at least annually if it is determined based on certain qualitative factors that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount we apply the twostep approach certain qualitative factors assessed by us include current macroeconomic conditions state of the equity and capital markets and the overall financial and operating performance of hcp if we qualitatively determine that it is more likely than not the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount the twostep approach is necessary 

if the fair value of a reporting unit containing goodwill is less than its carrying value then the second step of the test is needed to measure the amount of potential goodwill impairment the second step requires the fair value of a reporting unit to be allocated to all the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination at the date of the impairment test the excess of the fair value of the reporting unit over the fair value of assets and liabilities is the implied value of goodwill and is used to determine the amount of impairment we estimate the current fair value of the assets and liabilities in the reporting unit through various valuation techniques including applying capitalization rates to segment net operating income quoted market values and thirdparty appraisals as necessary the fair value of the reporting unit may also include an allocation of an enterprise value premium that we estimate a third party would be willing to pay for the company 

the determination of the fair value of real estate assets and goodwill involves significant judgment this judgment is based on our analysis and estimates of fair value of real estate assets and reporting units and the future operating results and resulting cash flows of each real estate asset whose carrying amount may not be recoverable our ability to accurately predict future operating results and cash flows and estimate and allocate fair values impacts the timing and recognition of impairments while we believe our assumptions are reasonable changes in these assumptions may have a material impact on our financial results 

investments in unconsolidated joint ventures 

investments in entities which we do not consolidate but have the ability to exercise significant influence over operating and financial policies are reported under the equity method of accounting under the equity method of accounting our share of the investees earnings or losses is included in our consolidated results of operations 

the initial carrying value of investments in unconsolidated joint ventures is based on the amount paid to purchase the joint venture interest or the carrying value of the assets prior to the sale of interests in the joint venture we evaluate our equity method investments for impairment based upon a comparison of the fair value of the equity method investment to our carrying value if we determine a decline in the fair value of our investment in an unconsolidated joint venture is below its carrying value is otherthantemporary an impairment is recorded the determination of the fair value and as to whether a deficiency in fair value is otherthantemporary of investments in unconsolidated joint 

ventures involves significant judgment our estimates consider all available evidence including as appropriate the present value of the expected future cash flows discounted at market rates general economic conditions and trends severity and duration of the fair value deficiency and other relevant factors capitalization rates discount rates and credit spreads utilized in our valuation models are based upon rates that we believe to be within a reasonable range of current market rates for the respective investments while we believe our assumptions are reasonable changes in these assumptions may have a material impact on our financial results 

income taxes 

as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements significant management judgment is required to evaluate our compliance with reit requirements our determinations are based on interpretation of tax laws and our conclusions may have an impact on the income tax expense recognized adjustments to income tax expense may be required as a result of i audits conducted by federal state and local tax authorities ii our ability to qualify as a reit iii the potential for builtingain recognized related to priortaxfree acquisitions of c corporations and iv changes in tax laws adjustments required in any given period are included within the income tax provision 

results of operations 

we evaluate our business and allocate resources among our five business segments i senior housing ii postacuteskilled nursing iii life science iv medical office and v hospital under the senior housing life science postacuteskilled nursing and hospital segments we invest or coinvest primarily in single operator or tenant properties through the acquisition and development of real estate management of operations and by debt issued by operators in these sectors under the medical office segment we invest or coinvest through the acquisition and development of mobs that are leased under gross modified gross or triplenet leases generally to multiple tenants and which generally require a greater level of property management the accounting policies of the segments are the same as those described in the summary of significant accounting policies see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements 

we use net operating income noi and adjusted noi to assess and compare property level performance including our same property portfolio spp and to make decisions about resource allocations we believe these measures provide investors relevant and useful information because they reflect only income and operating expense items that are incurred at the property level and present them on an unleveraged basis we believe that net income is the most directly comparable gaap measure to noi noi should not be viewed as an alternative measure of operating performance to net income as defined by gaap since noi excludes certain components from net income further noi may not be comparable to that of other reits as they may use different methodologies for calculating noi see note 14 to the consolidated financial statements for additional segment information and the relevant reconciliations from net income to noi and adjusted noi 

operating expenses are generally related to mob and life science leased properties and senior housing properties managed on our behalf ridea properties we generally recover all or a portion of mob and life science expenses from the tenants tenant recoveries the presentation of expenses as operating or general and administrative is based on the underlying nature of the expense periodically we review the classification of expenses between categories and make revisions based on changes in the underlying nature of the expenses 

our evaluation of results of operations by each business segment includes an analysis of our spp and our total property portfolio spp information allows us to evaluate the performance of our leased property portfolio under a consistent population by eliminating changes in the composition of our portfolio of properties we identify our spp as stabilized properties that remained in operations and 

were consistently reported as leased properties or ridea properties for the duration of the yearoveryear comparison periods presented accordingly it takes a stabilized property a minimum of 12 months in operations under a consistent reporting structure to be included in our spp newly acquired operating assets are generally considered stabilized at the earlier of leaseup typically when the tenants controls the physical use of at least 80 of the space or 12 months from the acquisition date newly completed developments including redevelopments are considered stabilized at the earlier of leaseup or 24 months from the date the property is placed in service spp noi excludes certain nonproperty specific operating expenses that are allocated to each operating segment on a consolidated basis

hcr manorcare acquisition the 11 million writeoff of unamortized loan fees related to an expired bridge loan commitment and the consolidation of hcp ventures ii on january 14 2011 that included the consolidation of 635 million of mortgage debt which increases were partially offset by the impact of repayments of mortgage debt related to contractual maturities and senior unsecured notes during 2010 and 2011 and lower interest rates during 2011 as compared to 2010

general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses increased 13 million to 96 million for the year ended december 31 2011 the increase in general and administrative expenses was a result of increases in acquisition costs primarily attributable to our hcr manorcare acquisition and compensation related expenses these increases were partially offset by a decrease in legal fees associated with litigation matters see the information set forth under the heading legal proceedings of note 12 to the consolidated financial statements

equity income from unconsolidated joint ventures during the year ended december 31 2011 equity income from unconsolidated joint ventures increased 42 million to 47 million this increase was primarily a result of equity income from our 94 interest in hcr manorcare see notes 3 and 8 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information partially offset by the impact of our consolidation of hcp ventures ii on january 14 2011 which was previously accounted for as an equity method investment

discontinued operations income from discontinued operations for the year ended december 31 2011 was 7 million compared to 29 million for the comparable period in 2010 the decrease is primarily due to a decrease in gains on real estate dispositions of 17 million and a decline in operating income from discontinued operations of 5 million during the year ended december 31 2011 we sold properties for 19 million compared to 56 million for the year ended december 31 2010

access to capital markets impacts our cost of capital and ability to refinance maturing indebtedness as well as our ability to fund future acquisitions and development through the issuance of additional securities or secured debt credit ratings impact our ability to access capital and directly impact our cost of capital as well for example as noted below our revolving line of credit facility accrues interest at a rate per annum equal to libor plus a margin that depends upon our debt ratings we also pay a facility fee on the entire revolving commitment that depends upon our debt ratings as of february 11 2013 we had a credit rating of bbb from fitch baa1 from moodys and bbb from sp on our senior unsecured debt securities 

net cash provided by operating activities was 1 billion and 724 million for the years ended december 31 2012 and 2011 respectively the increase in operating cash flows is primarily the result of the following i the additive impact of our acquisitions in 2011 and 2012 ii assets placed in service in 2011 and 2012 and iii rent escalations and resets in 2011 and 2012 which increases were partially offset by increased debt interest payments our cash flows from operations are dependent upon the occupancy level of multitenant buildings rental rates on leases our tenants performance on their lease obligations the level of operating expenses and other factors 

the following are significant investing and financing activities for the year ended december 31 2012 

• acquired 19 billion of real estate including the 17 billion blackstone jv acquisition • purchased 215 million £137 million of senior unsecured notes and funded 219 million of loans • raised 35 billion of debt and equity capital to fund among other things the aforementioned investments repay debt totaling 860 million and redeem preferred securities for 296 million and • paid dividends on common and preferred stock of 865 million which are generally funded by cash provided by our operating activities debt 

bank line of credit and term loan on march 27 2012 we executed an amendment to our existing 15 billion unsecured revolving line of credit facility the facility this amendment reduces the cost of the facility lower borrowing rate and facility fee and extends the facilitys maturity by one additional year to march 2016 the facility contains a oneyear extension option borrowings under this facility accrue interest at libor plus a margin that depends upon our debt ratings we pay a facility fee on the entire revolving commitment that depends on our debt ratings based on our debt ratings at february 11 2013 the margin on the facility was 1075 and the facility fee was 0175 the facility also includes a feature that will allow us to increase the borrowing capacity by an aggregate amount of up to 500 million subject to securing additional commitments from existing lenders or new lending institutions 

on july 30 2012 we entered into a credit agreement with a syndicate of banks for a £137 million 223 million at december 31 2012 fouryear unsecured term loan the term loan that accrues interest at a rate of gbp libor plus 120 based on our current debt ratings concurrent with the closing of the term loan we entered into a fouryear interest rate swap agreement that fixed the rate of the term loan at 181 subject to adjustments based on our credit ratings the term loan contains a oneyear committed extension option 

our facility and term loan contain certain financial restrictions and other customary requirements among other things these covenants using terms defined in the agreements i limit the ratio of consolidated total indebtedness to consolidated total asset value to 60 ii limit the ratio 

of secured debt to consolidated total asset value to 30 iii limit the ratio of unsecured debt to consolidated unencumbered asset value to 60 iv require a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio of 15 times and v require a formuladetermined minimum consolidated tangible net worth of 92 billion at december 31 2012 at december 31 2012 we were in compliance with each of these restrictions and requirements of the facility and term loan 

our facility also contains crossdefault provisions to other indebtedness of ours including in some instances certain mortgages on our properties certain mortgages contain default provisions relating to defaults under the leases or operating agreements on the applicable properties by our operators or tenants including default provisions relating to the bankruptcy filings of such operator or tenant although we believe that we would be able to secure amendments under the applicable agreements if a default as described above occurs such a default may result in significantly less favorable borrowing terms than currently available material delays in the availability of funding or other material adverse consequences 

senior unsecured notes at december 31 2012 we had senior unsecured notes outstanding with an aggregate principal balance of 67 billion interest rates on the notes ranged from 121 to 707 with a weighted average effective interest rate of 510 and a weighted average maturity of six years at december 31 2012 the senior unsecured notes contain certain covenants including limitations on debt maintenance of unencumbered assets crossacceleration provisions and other customary terms at december 31 2012 we believe we were in compliance with these covenants

mortgage debt generally requires monthly principal and interest payments is collateralized by certain properties and is generally nonrecourse mortgage debt typically restricts transfer of the encumbered properties prohibits additional liens restricts prepayment requires payment of real estate taxes requires maintenance of the assets in good condition requires maintenance of insurance on the assets and includes conditions to obtain lender consent to enter into and terminate material leases some of the mortgage debt is also crosscollateralized by multiple properties and may require tenants or operators to maintain compliance with the applicable leases or operating agreements of such real estate assets 

other debt at december 31 2012 we had 82 million of noninterest bearing life care bonds at two of our continuing care retirement communities and noninterest bearing occupancy fee deposits at two of our senior housing facilities all of which were payable to certain residents of the facilities collectively life care bonds the life care bonds are refundable to the residents upon the termination of the contract or upon the successful resale of the unit

we may offer and sell the securities pursuant to the prospectus through underwriters dealers or agents or directly to purchasers on a continuous or delayed basis the securities may also be resold by selling security holders the prospectus supplement for each offering will describe in detail the plan of distribution for that offering and will set forth the names of any underwriters dealers or agents involved in the offering and any applicable fees commissions or discount arrangements we intend to use the net proceeds from the sales of the securities as set forth in the applicable prospectus supplement and unless otherwise set forth in a therein we will not receive any proceeds if the securities are sold by a selling security holder 

nongaap financial measure—funds from operations ffo 

we believe ffo applicable to common shares diluted ffo applicable to common shares and basic and diluted ffo per common share are important supplemental nongaap measures of operating performance for a reit because the historical cost accounting convention used for real estate assets utilizes straightline depreciation except on land such accounting presentation implies that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time since real estate values instead have historically risen and fallen with market conditions presentations of operating results for a reit that uses historical cost accounting for depreciation could be less informative the term ffo was designed by the reit industry to address this issue 

ffo is defined as net income applicable to common shares computed in accordance with gaap excluding gains or losses from acquisition and dispositions of depreciable real estate or related interests impairments of or related to depreciable real estate plus real estate and dfl depreciation and amortization with adjustments for joint ventures adjustments for joint ventures are calculated to reflect ffo on the same basis ffo does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with gaap is not necessarily indicative of cash available to fund cash needs and should not be considered an alternative to net income we compute ffo in accordance with the current national association of real estate investment trusts nareit definition however other reits may report ffo differently or have a different interpretation of the current nareit definition from us in addition we present ffo before the impact of litigation settlement charges preferred stock redemption charges impairments recoveries of nondepreciable assets and mergerrelated items defined below ffo as adjusted management believes ffo as adjusted is a useful alternative measurement this measure is a modification of the nareit definition of ffo and should not be used as an alternative to net income determined in accordance with gaap 

details of certain items that affect comparability are discussed under results of operations above the following is a reconciliation from net income applicable to common shares the most direct 

comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with gaap to ffo and ffo as adjusted in thousands except per share data 





1 in connection with the redemption of our preferred stock during the year ended december 31 2012 we incurred a redemption charge of 104 million related to the original issuance costs 2 the litigation settlement charge during the year ended december 31 2011 relates to the ventas settlement 3 the following impairments net of recoveries had an impact on ffo • the impairment charge during the year ended december 31 2012 relates to the sale of a land parcel in our life science segment • the impairment charge during the year ended december 31 2011 relates to our senior secured loan to delphis • recoveries for the year ended december 31 2010 relate to portions of previous impairment charges related to investments in three direct financing leases nondepreciable due to lessee purchase option and a participation interest in a senior construction loan related to erickson 4 the year ended december 31 2012 mergerrelated items of 002 per share attributable to the senior housing portfolio acquisition include direct transaction costs and the impact of the negative carry of prefunding the transaction with the 10 billion or 22 million shares common stock offering completed on october 19 2012 on the calculation of weighted average shares proceeds from this offering were used to fund the senior housing portfolio acquisition mergerrelated items for the year ended december 31 2011 are attributable to our hcr manorcare acquisition incurred from january 1st through april 6th 2011 which include the following i 268 million of direct transaction costs ii 239 million of interest expense associated with the 24 billion senior unsecured notes issued on january 24 2011 proceeds from which were obtained to prefund the hcr manorcare acquisition partially offset by iii 241 million of income related to gains upon the reinvestment of the our debt investment in hcr manorcare and other miscellaneous items mergerrelated items for 2010 primarily include professional fees associated with our hcr manorcare acquisition 5 our weighted average shares used to calculate diluted ffo as adjusted eliminate the impact of 46 million shares of common stock from our december 2010 offering and 30 million shares from our march 2011 common stock offering excludes 45 million shares sold to the underwriters upon exercise of their option to purchase additional shares which issuances increased our weighted average shares by 129 million and 15 million for the years ended december 31 2011 and 2010 respectively proceeds from these offerings were used to fund a portion of the cash consideration for the hcr manorcare acquisition offbalance sheet arrangements 

we own interests in certain unconsolidated joint ventures as described under note 8 to the consolidated financial statements except in limited circumstances our risk of loss is limited to our investment in the joint venture and any outstanding loans receivable in addition we have certain properties which serve as collateral for debt that is owed by a previous owner of certain of our facilities as described under note 12 to the consolidated financial statements our risk of loss for these certain properties is limited to the outstanding debt balance plus penalties if any we have no other material offbalance sheet arrangements that we expect would materially affect our liquidity and capital resources except those described below under contractual obligations  

contractual obligations 

the following table summarizes our material contractual payment obligations and commitments at december 31 2012 in thousands 



1 excludes 82 million of other debt that represents life care bonds that have no scheduled maturities 2 represents £137 million translated into us dollars as of december 31 2012 3 represents commitments to finance development projects and related working capital financings 4 represents construction and other commitments for developments in progress 5 interest on variablerate debt is calculated using rates in effect at december 31 2012 inflation 

our leases often provide for either fixed increases in base rents or indexed escalators based on the consumer price index or other measures andor additional rent based on increases in the tenants operating revenues most of our mob leases require the tenant to pay a share of property operating costs such as real estate taxes insurance and utilities substantially all of our senior housing life science postacuteskilled nursing and hospital leases require the operator or tenant to pay all of the property operating costs or reimburse us for all such costs we believe that inflationary increases in expenses will be offset in part by the operator or tenant expense reimbursements and contractual rent increases described above 

recent accounting pronouncements 

see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for the impact of new accounting standards there were no accounting pronouncements that were issued but not yet adopted by us that we believe will materially impact our consolidated financial statements 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we use derivative financial instruments in the normal course of business to mitigate interest rate and foreign currency risk we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes derivatives are recorded on the consolidated balance sheets at their fair value see note 24 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 

to illustrate the effect of movements in the interest rate and foreign currency markets we performed a market sensitivity analysis on our hedging instruments we applied various basis point spreads to the underlying interest rate curves and foreign currency exchange rates of the derivative portfolio in order to determine the instruments change in fair value assuming a one percentage point change in the underlying interest rate curve and foreign currency exchange rates the estimated change 

in fair value of each of the underlying derivative instruments would not exceed 8 million see note 24 to the consolidated financial statements for additional analysis details 

interest rate risk at december 31 2012 we were exposed to market risks related to fluctuations in interest rates on properties with a gross value of 83 million that are subject to leases where the payments fluctuate with changes in libor excludes 223 million of variablerate senior unsecured notes that have been hedged through interestrate swap contracts our exposure to income fluctuations related to our variablerate investments is partially offset by i 25 million of variablerate senior unsecured notes and ii 15 million of variablerate mortgage debt payable excludes 86 million of variablerate mortgage notes that have been hedged through interestrate swap contracts additionally our exposure to market risks related to fluctuations in interest rates excludes our gbp denominated 223 million £137 million variablerate term loan that has been hedged through interestrate swap contracts 

interest rate fluctuations will generally not affect our future earnings or cash flows on our fixed rate debt and assets unless such instruments mature or are otherwise terminated however interest rate changes will affect the fair value of our fixed rate instruments conversely changes in interest rates on variable rate debt and investments would change our future earnings and cash flows but not significantly affect the fair value of those instruments assuming a one percentage point increase in the interest rate related to the variablerate investments and variablerate debt and assuming no other changes in the outstanding balance as of december 31 2012 our annual interest expense would increase by approximately 03 million or less than 001 per common share on a diluted basis 

foreign currency exchange rate risk at december 31 2012 our exposure to foreign currency exchange rates relates to forecasted interest receipts from our gbp denominated senior unsecured notes see additional discussion of the four seasons health care senior unsecured notes in note 10 of the consolidated financial statements our foreign currency exchange exposure is mitigated by the forecasted interest and principal payments from our gbp denominated unsecured term loan see note 11 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information and a foreign currency swap contract for approximately 85 of the forecasted interest receipts from our senior unsecured notes through the noncall period which ends on june 15 2016 

market risk we have investments in marketable debt securities classified as heldtomaturity because we have the positive intent and ability to hold the securities to maturity heldtomaturity securities are recorded at amortized cost and adjusted for the amortization of premiums and discounts through maturity we consider a variety of factors in evaluating an otherthantemporary decline in value such as the length of time and the extent to which the market value has been less than our current adjusted carrying value the issuers financial condition capital strength and nearterm prospects any recent events specific to that issuer and economic conditions of its industry and our investment horizon in relationship to an anticipated nearterm recovery in the market value if any at december 31 2012 the fair value and adjusted carrying value of marketable debt securities were 234 million and 223 million respectively 

we have investments in marketable equity securities classified as availableforsale gains and losses on these securities are recognized in income when realized and losses are recognized when an otherthantemporary decline in value is identified an initial indicator of an otherthantemporary decline in value for marketable equity securities is based on the severity of the decline in market value below the cost basis for an extended period of time we consider a variety of factors in evaluating an otherthantemporary decline in value such as the length of time and the extent to which the market value has been less than our current cost basis the issuers financial condition capital strength and nearterm prospects any recent events specific to that issuer and economic conditions of its industry and our investment horizon in relationship to an anticipated nearterm recovery in the market value if 

any at december 31 2012 the fair value and adjusted cost basis of marketable equity securities were 25 million and 17 million respectively 

the principal amount and the average interest rates for our loans receivable and debt categorized by maturity dates is presented in the table below the fair value for our senior unsecured notes payable is based on prevailing market prices the fair value estimates for loans receivable and mortgage debt payable are based on discounting future cash flows utilizing current rates for loans and debt of the same type and remaining maturity 



1 effective january 1 2011 a senior secured loan to delphis was placed on nonaccrual status for additional information regarding the senior secured loan to delphis see note 7 to the consolidated financial statements 2 excludes 82 million of other debt that represents noninterest bearing life care bonds and occupancy fee deposits at certain of our senior housing facilities which have no scheduled maturities

 item 1 business 

business overview 

hcp an sp 500 company invests primarily in real estate serving the healthcare industry in the united states we are a selfadministered maryland real estate investment trust reit organized in 1985 we are headquartered in long beach california with offices in nashville tennessee and san francisco california we acquire develop lease manage and dispose of healthcare real estate and provide financing to healthcare providers our portfolio is comprised of investments in the following five healthcare segments i senior housing ii life science iii medical office iv postacuteskilled nursing and v hospital we make investments within our healthcare segments using the following five investment products i properties under lease ii debt investments iii developments and redevelopments iv investment management and v ridea which represents investments in senior housing operations utilizing the structure permitted by the housing and economic recovery act of 2008 

the delivery of healthcare services requires real estate and as a result tenants and operators depend on real estate in part to maintain and grow their businesses we believe that the healthcare real estate market provides investment opportunities due to the following 

• compelling demographics driving the demand for healthcare services • specialized nature of healthcare real estate investing and • ongoing consolidation of a fragmented healthcare real estate sector our website address is wwwhcpicom  our annual reports on form 10k quarterly reports on form 10q current reports on form 8k and any amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to section 13a or 15d of the securities exchange act of 1934 the exchange act are available on our website free of charge as soon as reasonably practicable after we electronically file such materials with or furnish them to the united states us securities and exchange commission sec

business strategy 

our primary goal is to increase shareholder value through profitable growth our investment strategy to achieve this goal is based on three principles i opportunistic investing ii portfolio diversification and iii conservative financing 

opportunistic investing 

we make investment decisions that are expected to drive profitable growth and create shareholder value we attempt to position ourselves to create and take advantage of situations to meet our goals and investment criteria 

portfolio diversification 

we believe in maintaining a portfolio of healthcare investments diversified by segment geography operator tenant and investment product diversification reduces the likelihood that a single event would materially harm our business and allows us to take advantage of opportunities in different markets based on individual market dynamics while pursuing our strategy of diversification we monitor but do not limit our investments based on the percentage of our total assets that may be invested in any one property type investment product geographic location the number of properties which we may lease to a single operator or tenant or loans we may make to a single borrower with investments in multiple segments and investment products we can focus on opportunities with the most attractive riskreward profile for the portfolio as a whole we may structure transactions as master leases require operator or tenant insurance and indemnifications obtain credit enhancements in the form of guarantees letters of credit or security deposits and take other measures to mitigate risk 

conservative financing 

we believe a conservative balance sheet is important to our ability to execute our opportunistic investing approach we strive to maintain a conservative balance sheet by actively managing our debttoequity levels and maintaining multiple sources of liquidity such as our revolving line of credit facility access to capital markets and secured debt lenders relationships with current and prospective institutional joint venture partners and our ability to divest of assets our debt obligations are primarily fixed rate with staggered maturities which reduces the impact of rising interest rates on our operations 

we finance our investments based on our evaluation of available sources of funding for shortterm purposes we may utilize our revolving line of credit facility or arrange for other shortterm borrowings from banks or other sources we arrange for longerterm financing through offerings of 

equity and debt securities placement of mortgage debt and capital from other institutional lenders and equity investors 

we specifically incorporate by reference into this section the information set forth in item 7 2011 transaction overview included elsewhere in this report 

competition 

investing in real estate serving the healthcare industry is highly competitive we face competition from other reits investment companies private equity and hedge fund investors sovereign funds healthcare operators lenders developers and other institutional investors some of whom may have greater resources and lower costs of capital than we do increased competition makes it more challenging for us to identify and successfully capitalize on opportunities that meet our objectives our ability to compete may also be impacted by national and local economic trends availability of investment alternatives availability and cost of capital construction and renovation costs existing laws and regulations new legislation and population trends 

income from our facilities is dependent on the ability of our operators and tenants to compete with other companies on a number of different levels including the quality of care provided reputation the physical appearance of a facility price and range of services offered alternatives for healthcare delivery the supply of competing properties physicians staff referral sources location the size and demographics of the population in surrounding areas and the financial condition of our tenants and operators private federal and state payment programs as well as the effect of laws and regulations may also have a significant influence on the profitability of our tenants and operators for a discussion of the risks associated with competitive conditions affecting our business see risk factors in item 1a 

healthcare segments

• assisted living facilities alfs are licensed care facilities that provide personal care services support and housing for those who need help with activities of daily living adl yet require limited medical care the programs and services may include transportation social activities exercise and fitness programs beauty or barber shop access hobby and craft activities community excursions meals in a dining room setting and other activities sought by residents these facilities are often in apartmentlike buildings with private residences ranging from single rooms to large apartments certain alfs may offer higher levels of personal assistance for residents with alzheimers disease or other forms of dementia levels of personal assistance are based in part on local regulations at december 31 2011 we had interests in 258 alfs • independent living facilities ilfs are designed to meet the needs of seniors who choose to live in an environment surrounded by their peers with services such as housekeeping meals and activities these residents generally do not need assistance with adl such as bathing eating and dressing however residents have the option to contract for these services at december 31 2011 we had interests in 44 ilfs 5 

• continuing care retirement communities ccrcs provide housing and healthrelated services under longterm contracts this alternative is appealing to residents as it eliminates the need for relocating when health and medical needs change thus allowing residents to age in place some ccrcs require a substantial entry or buyin fee and most also charge monthly maintenance fees in exchange for a living unit meals and some health services ccrcs typically require the individual to be in relatively good health and independent upon entry at december 31 2011 we had interests in 12 ccrcs our senior housing segment accounted for approximately 31 30 and 30 of total revenues for the years ended december 31 2011 2010 and 2009 respectively the following table provides information about our senior housing operator concentration for the year ended december 31 2011

properties under lease we primarily generate revenue by leasing properties under longterm leases most of our rents and other earned income from leases are received under triplenet leases or leases that provide for a substantial recovery of operating expenses however some of our mobs and life science facility rents are structured under gross or modified gross leases accordingly for such gross or modified gross leases we incur certain property operating expenses such as real estate taxes repairs and maintenance property management fees utilities and insurance 

our ability to grow income from properties under lease depends in part on our ability to i increase rental income and other earned income from leases by increasing rental rates and occupancy levels ii maximize tenant recoveries and iii control nonrecoverable operating expenses most of our leases include contractual annual base rent escalation clauses that are either predetermined fixed increases andor are a function of an inflation index

investment management we coinvest in real estate properties with institutional investors through joint ventures structured as partnerships or limited liability companies we target institutional investors with longterm investment horizons who seek to benefit from our expertise in healthcare real estate predominantly we retain noncontrolling interests in the joint ventures ranging from 20 to 30 and serve as the managing member these ventures generally allow us to earn acquisition and asset management fees and have the potential for promoted interests or incentive distributions based on performance of the joint venture 

operating properties ridea we entered into contracts with healthcare operators to manage communities that are placed in a structure permitted by the housing and economic recovery act of 2008 commonly referred to as ridea under the provisions of ridea a reit may lease qualified health care properties on an arms length basis to a taxable reit subsidiary trs if the property is operated on behalf of such subsidiary by a person who qualifies as an eligible independent contractor we view ridea as a structure primarily to be used on properties that present attractive valuation entry points where repositioning with a new operator that is aligned with hcp can bring scale operating efficiencies andor ancillary services to drive growth

government regulation licensing and enforcement 

overview 

our tenants and operators are typically subject to extensive and complex federal state and local healthcare laws and regulations relating to fraud and abuse practices government reimbursement licensure and certificate of need and similar laws governing the operation of healthcare facilities and we expect that the healthcare industry in general will continue to face increased regulation and pressure in the areas of fraud waste and abuse cost control healthcare management and provision of services among others these regulations are wideranging and can subject our tenants and operators to civil criminal and administrative sanctions affected tenants and operators may find it increasingly difficult to comply with this complex and evolving regulatory environment because of a relative lack of guidance in many areas as certain of our healthcare properties are subject to oversight from several government agencies and the laws may vary from one jurisdiction to another changes in laws and regulations and reimbursement enforcement activity and regulatory noncompliance by our tenants and operators can all have a significant effect on their operations and financial condition which in turn may adversely impact us as detailed below and set forth under risk factors in item 1a 

we seek to mitigate the risk to us resulting from the significant healthcare regulatory risks faced by our tenants and operators by diversifying our portfolio among property types and geographical areas diversifying our tenant and operator base to limit our exposure to any single entity and seeking tenants and operators who are not largely dependent on medicaid reimbursement for their revenues based on 

information primarily provided by our tenants and operators excluding our medical office segment at december 31 2011 we estimate that approximately 21 and 13 of the annualized base rental payments received from our tenants and operators are dependant on medicare and medicaid reimbursement respectively the increase in our exposure to medicare and medicaid reimbursement from levels reported as of december 31 2010 is primarily the result of the facilities acquired through the hcr manorcare acquisition for additional details of the hcr manorcare acquisition see note 3 to the consolidated financial statements 

the following is a discussion of certain laws and regulations generally applicable to our operators and in certain cases to us 

fraud and abuse enforcement 

there are various extremely complex federal and state laws and regulations governing healthcare providers relationships and arrangements and prohibiting fraudulent and abusive practices by such providers these laws include i federal and state false claims acts which among other things prohibit providers from filing false claims or making false statements to receive payment from medicare medicaid or other federal or state healthcare programs ii federal and state antikickback and feesplitting statutes including the medicare and medicaid antikickback statute which prohibit the payment or receipt of remuneration to induce referrals or recommendations of healthcare items or services iii federal and state physician selfreferral laws commonly referred to as the stark law which generally prohibit referrals by physicians to entities with which the physician or an immediate family member has a financial relationship iv the federal civil monetary penalties law which prohibits among other things the knowing presentation of a false or fraudulent claim for certain healthcare services and v federal and state privacy laws including the privacy and security rules contained in the health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 which provide for the privacy and security of personal health information violations of healthcare fraud and abuse laws carry civil criminal and administrative sanctions including punitive sanctions monetary penalties imprisonment denial of medicare and medicaid reimbursement and potential exclusion from medicare medicaid or other federal or state healthcare programs these laws are enforced by a variety of federal state and local agencies and can also be enforced by private litigants through among other things federal and state false claims acts which allow private litigants to bring qui tam or whistleblower actions many of our operators and tenants are subject to these laws and some of them may in the future become the subject of governmental enforcement actions if they fail to comply with applicable laws 

reimbursement 

sources of revenue for many of our tenants and operators include among other sources governmental healthcare programs such as the federal medicare program and state medicaid programs and nongovernmental payors such as insurance carriers and hmos as federal and state governments focus on healthcare reform initiatives and as many states face significant budget deficits efforts to reduce costs by these payors will likely continue which may result in reduced or slower growth in reimbursement for certain services provided by some of our tenants and operators 

healthcare licensure and certificate of need 

certain healthcare facilities in our portfolio are subject to extensive federal state and local licensure certification and inspection laws and regulations in addition various licenses and permits are required to dispense narcotics operate pharmacies handle radioactive materials and operate equipment many states require certain healthcare providers to obtain a certificate of need which requires prior approval for the construction expansion and closure of certain healthcare facilities the approval process related to state certificate of need laws may impact some of our tenants and operators abilities to expand or change their businesses 

life science facilities 

while certain of our life science tenants include some wellestablished companies other such tenants are less established and in some cases may not yet have a product approved by the food and drug administration or other regulatory authorities for commercial sale creating a new pharmaceutical product or medical device requires substantial investments of time and money in part because of the extensive regulation of the healthcare industry it also entails considerable risk of failure in demonstrating that the product is safe and effective and in gaining regulatory approval and market acceptance 

senior housing entrance fee communities 

certain of the senior housing facilities mortgaged to or owned by us are operated as entrance fee communities generally an entrance fee is an upfront fee or consideration paid by a resident a portion of which may be refundable in exchange for some form of longterm benefit some of the entrance fee communities are subject to significant state regulatory oversight including for example oversight of each facilitys financial condition establishment and monitoring of reserve requirements and other financial restrictions the right of residents to cancel their contracts within a specified period of time lien rights in favor of the residents restrictions on change of ownership and similar matters 

americans with disabilities act the ada 

our properties must comply with the ada and any similar state or local laws to the extent that such properties are public accommodations as defined in those statutes the ada may require removal of barriers to access by persons with disabilities in certain public areas of our properties where such removal is readily achievable to date we have not received any notices of noncompliance with the ada that have caused us to incur substantial capital expenditures to address ada concerns should barriers to access by persons with disabilities be discovered at any of our properties we may be directly or indirectly responsible for additional costs that may be required to make facilities adacompliant noncompliance with the ada could result in the imposition of fines or an award of damages to private litigants the obligation to make readily achievable accommodations pursuant to the ada is an ongoing one and we continue to assess our properties and make modifications as appropriate in this respect 

environmental matters 

a wide variety of federal state and local environmental and occupational health and safety laws and regulations affect healthcare facility operations these complex federal and state statutes and their enforcement involve a myriad of regulations many of which involve strict liability on the part of the potential offender some of these federal and state statutes may directly impact us under various federal state and local environmental laws ordinances and regulations an owner of real property or a secured lender such as us may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of hazardous or toxic substances at under or disposed of in connection with such property as well as other potential costs relating to hazardous or toxic substances including government fines and damages for injuries to persons and adjacent property the cost of any required remediation removal fines or personal or property damages and the owners or secured lenders liability therefore could exceed or impair the value of the property andor the assets of the owner or secured lender in addition the presence of such substances or the failure to properly dispose of or remediate such substances may adversely affect the owners ability to sell or rent such property or to borrow using such property as collateral which in turn could reduce our revenues for a description of the risks associated with environmental matters see risk factors in item 1a of this report 




 item 1a risk factors 

  the section below discusses the most significant risk factors that may materially adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

as set forth below we believe that the risks facing our company generally fall into the following three categories 

• risks related to our business • risks related to tax matters including reitrelated risks and • risks related to our legal organizational structure risks related to our business 

volatility or disruption in the financial markets may impair our ability to raise capital obtain new financing or refinance existing obligations and fund real estate and development activities 

the global financial markets recently have undergone and may continue to experience pervasive and fundamental disruptions while the capital markets have shown signs of improvement the sustainability of an economic recovery is uncertain and additional levels of market disruption and volatility could materially adversely impact our ability to raise capital obtain new financing or refinance our existing obligations as they mature and fund real estate and development activities 

market volatility could also lead to significant uncertainty in the valuation of our investments and those of our joint ventures that may result in a substantial decrease in the value of our properties and those of our joint ventures as a result we may not be able to recover the carrying amount of such investments and the associated goodwill if any which may require us to recognize impairment charges in earnings 

we rely on external sources of capital to fund future capital needs and limitations on our access to such capital could have a materially adverse effect on our ability to meet commitments as they become due or make future investments necessary to grow our business 

we may not be able to fund all future capital needs from cash retained from operations if we are unable to obtain enough internal capital we may need to rely on external sources of capital including debt and equity financing to fulfill our capital requirements if we cannot access these external sources of capital we may not be able to make the investments needed to grow our business and to meet our obligations and commitments as they mature our access to capital depends upon a number of factors some of which we have little or no control over including but not limited to 

• general availability of credit and market conditions including rising interest rates and increased borrowing cost • the market price of the shares of our equity securities and the credit ratings of our debt and preferred securities • the markets perception of our growth potential and our current and potential future earnings and cash distributions • our degree of financial leverage and operational flexibility • the financial integrity of our lenders which might impair their ability to meet their commitments to us or their willingness to make additional loans to us and our inability to replace the financing commitment of any such lender on favorable terms or at all • the stability in the market value of our properties 13 

• the financial performance of our operators tenants and borrowers and • issues facing the healthcare industry including but not limited to healthcare reform and changes in government reimbursement policies if our access to capital is limited by these factors or other factors it could have a material adverse impact on our ability to refinance our debt obligations fund dividend payments acquire properties and fund operations and development activities 

adverse changes in our credit ratings could impair our ability to obtain additional debt and equity financing on favorable terms if at all and negatively impact the market price of our securities including our common stock 

the credit ratings of our senior unsecured debt and preferred equity securities are based on our operating performance liquidity and leverage ratios overall financial position and other factors employed by the credit rating agencies in their rating analyses of us our credit ratings can affect the amount and type of capital we can access as well as the terms of any financings we may obtain there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain our current credit ratings and in the event that our current credit ratings deteriorate we would likely incur higher borrowing costs and it may be more difficult or expensive to obtain additional financing or refinance existing obligations and commitments also a downgrade in our credit ratings would trigger additional costs or other potentially negative consequences under our current and future credit facilities and debt instruments 

our level of indebtedness may increase and materially adversely affect our future operations 

our outstanding indebtedness as of december 31 2011 was approximately 77 billion we may incur additional indebtedness in the future including in connection with the development or acquisition of assets which may be substantial any significant additional indebtedness could negatively affect the credit ratings of our debt and require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow to interest and principal payments due on our indebtedness greater demands on our cash resources may reduce funds available to us to pay dividends conduct development activities make capital expenditures and acquisitions or carry out other aspects of our business strategy increased indebtedness can also limit our ability to adjust rapidly to changing market conditions make us more vulnerable to general adverse economic and industry conditions and create competitive disadvantages for us compared to other companies with relatively lower debt levels increased future debt service obligations may limit our operational flexibility including our ability to finance or refinance our properties contribute properties to joint ventures or sell properties as needed 

covenants related to our indebtedness limit our operational flexibility and breaches of these covenants could materially adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

our unsecured credit facilities unsecured debt securities and secured debt and other indebtedness that we may incur in the future require or will require us to comply with a number of customary financial and other covenants such as maintaining certain levels of debt service coverage and leverage ratio tangible net worth requirements and maintaining reit status our continued ability to incur additional debt and to conduct business in general is subject to compliance with these financial and other covenants which limit our operational flexibility for example mortgages on our properties contain customary covenants such as those that limit or restrict our ability without the consent of the lender to further encumber or sell the applicable properties or to replace the applicable tenant or operator breaches of certain covenants may result in defaults under the mortgages on our properties and crossdefaults under certain of our other indebtedness even if we satisfy our payment obligations to the respective obligee additionally defaults under the leases or operating agreements related to mortgaged properties including defaults associated with the bankruptcy of the applicable tenant or 

operator may result in a default under the underlying mortgage and crossdefaults under certain of our other indebtedness covenants that limit our operational flexibility as well as defaults under our debt instruments could materially adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

an increase in interest rates could increase interest cost on new debt and could materially adversely impact our ability to refinance existing debt sell assets and limit our acquisition investment and development activities 

if interest rates increase so could our interest costs for any new debt this increased cost could make the financing of any acquisition and development activity more costly rising interest rates could limit our ability to refinance existing debt when it matures or cause us to pay higher interest rates upon refinancing and increase interest expense on refinanced indebtedness in addition an increase in interest rates could decrease the amount third parties are willing to pay for our assets thereby limiting our ability to reposition our portfolio promptly in response to changes in economic or other conditions 

unfavorable resolution of litigation matters and disputes could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition 

from time to time we are involved in legal proceedings lawsuits and other claims we may also be named as defendants in lawsuits allegedly arising out of our actions or the actions of our operators and tenants in which such operators and tenants have agreed to indemnify defend and hold us harmless from and against various claims litigation and liabilities arising in connection with their respective businesses an unfavorable resolution of litigation may have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition regardless of its outcome litigation may result in substantial costs and expenses and significantly divert the attention of management there can be no assurance that we will be able to prevail in or achieve a favorable settlement of litigation in addition litigation government proceedings or environmental matters could lead to increased costs or interruption of our normal business operations 

a small number of operators tenants and borrowers account for a large percentage of our revenues 

during the year ended december 31 2011 approximately 47 of our rental and related revenues are generated by our leasing or financial arrangements with the following four companies hcr manorcare 27 brookdale 7 emeritus 7 and sunrise 6 the failure inability or unwillingness of these operators tenants or borrowers to meet their obligations to us could materially reduce our cash flow as well as our results of operations which could in turn reduce the amount of dividends we pay cause our stock price to decline and have other material adverse effects on our business results of operations and financial condition 

we may be unable to successfully foreclose on the collateral securing our real estaterelated loans and even if we are successful in our foreclosure efforts we may be unable to successfully operate occupy or reposition the underlying real estate which may adversely affect our ability to recover our investments 

if an operator or tenant defaults under one of our mortgages or mezzanine loans we may have to foreclose on the loan or protect our interest by acquiring title to the collateral and thereafter making substantial improvements or repairs in order to maximize the propertys investment potential in some cases as noted above the collateral consists of the equity interests in an entity that directly or indirectly owns the applicable real property or interests in operating facilities and accordingly we may not have full recourse to assets of that entity operators tenants or borrowers may contest enforcement of foreclosure or other remedies seek bankruptcy protection against our exercise of enforcement or other remedies andor bring claims for lender liability in response to actions to enforce mortgage obligations foreclosurerelated costs high loantovalue ratios or declines in the value of the facility may prevent us from realizing an amount equal to our mortgage or mezzanine loan upon foreclosure 

and we may be required to record valuation allowance for such losses even if we are able to successfully foreclose on the collateral securing our real estaterelated loans we may inherit properties for which we may be unable to expeditiously seek tenants or operators if at all which would adversely affect our ability to fully recover our investment 

required regulatory approvals can delay or prohibit transfers of our healthcare facilities 

transfers of healthcare facilities to successor tenants or operators may be subject to regulatory approvals or ratifications including but not limited to change of ownership approvals under certificate of need laws and medicare and medicaid provider arrangements that are not required for transfers of other types of commercial operations and other types of real estate the replacement of any tenant or operator could be delayed by the regulatory approval process of any federal state or local government agency necessary for the transfer of the facility or the replacement of the operator licensed to manage the facility if we are unable to find a suitable replacement tenant or operator upon favorable terms or at all we may take possession of a facility which might expose us to successor liability or require us to indemnify subsequent operators to whom we might transfer the operating rights and licenses all of which may materially adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

competition may make it difficult to identify and purchase or develop suitable healthcare facilities to grow our investment portfolio 

we face significant competition from other reits investment companies private equity and hedge fund investors sovereign funds healthcare operators lenders developers and other institutional investors some of whom may have greater resources and lower costs of capital than we do increased competition makes it more challenging for us to identify and successfully capitalize on opportunities that meet our business goals and could improve the bargaining power of property owners seeking to sell thereby impeding our investment acquisition and development activities if we cannot capitalize on our development pipeline identify and purchase a sufficient quantity of healthcare facilities at favorable prices or if we are unable to finance acquisitions on commercially favorable terms our business results of operations and financial condition may be materially adversely affected 

we may be required to incur substantial renovation costs to make certain of our healthcare properties suitable for other operators and tenants 

healthcare facilities are typically highly customized and may not be easily adapted to nonhealthcarerelated uses the improvements generally required to conform a property to healthcare use such as upgrading electrical gas and plumbing infrastructure are costly and at times tenantspecific a new or replacement operator or tenant may require different features in a property depending on that operators or tenants particular operations if a current operator or tenant is unable to pay rent and vacates a property we may incur substantial expenditures to modify a property before we are able to secure another operator or tenant also if the property needs to be renovated to accommodate multiple operators or tenants we may incur substantial expenditures before we are able to release the space these expenditures or renovations may materially adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

we face additional risks associated with property development that can render a project less profitable or not profitable at all and under certain circumstances prevent completion of development activities once undertaken 

largescale groundup development of healthcare properties presents additional risks for us including risks that 

• a development opportunity may be abandoned after expending significant resources resulting in the loss of deposits or failure to recover expenses already incurred • the development and construction costs of a project may exceed original estimates due to increased interest rates and higher materials transportation labor leasing or other costs which could make the completion of the development project less profitable • construction andor permanent financing may not be available on favorable terms or at all • the project may not be completed on schedule which can result in increases in construction costs and debt service expenses as a result of a variety of factors that are beyond our control including natural disasters labor conditions material shortages regulatory hurdles civil unrest and acts of war and • occupancy rates and rents at a newly completed property may not meet expected levels and could be insufficient to make the property profitable these risks could result in substantial unanticipated delays or expenses and under certain circumstances could prevent completion of development activities once undertaken any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

our use of joint ventures may limit our flexibility with jointly owned investments 

we have and may continue in the future to develop andor acquire properties in joint ventures with other persons or entities when circumstances warrant the use of these structures our participation in joint ventures is subject to risks that may not be present with other methods of ownership including 

• we could experience an impasse on certain decisions because we do not have sole decisionmaking authority which could require us to expend additional resources on resolving such impasses or potential disputes including litigation or arbitration • our joint venture partners could have investment goals that are not consistent with our investment objectives including the timing terms and strategies for any investments • our ability to transfer our interest in a joint venture to a third party may be restricted • our joint venture partners might become bankrupt fail to fund their share of required capital contributions or fail to fulfill their obligations as a joint venture partner which may require us to infuse our own capital into the venture on behalf of the partner despite other competing uses for such capital and • our joint venture partners may have competing interests in our markets that could create conflict of interest issues from time to time we acquire other companies and if we are unable to successfully integrate these operations our business results of operations and financial condition may be materially adversely affected 

acquisitions require the integration of companies that have previously operated independently successful integration of the operations of these companies depends primarily on our ability to consolidate operations systems procedures properties and personnel and to eliminate redundancies and costs we may encounter difficulties in these integrations potential difficulties associated with 

acquisitions include the loss of key employees the disruption of our ongoing business or that of the acquired entity possible inconsistencies in standards controls procedures and policies and the assumption of unexpected liabilities including 

• liabilities relating to the cleanup or remediation of undisclosed environmental conditions • unasserted claims of vendors or other persons dealing with the seller • liabilities claims and litigation whether or not incurred in the ordinary course of business relating to periods prior to our acquisition • claims for indemnification by general partners directors officers and others indemnified by the seller and • liabilities for taxes relating to periods prior to our acquisition in addition the acquired companies and their properties may fail to perform as expected including in respect of estimated cost savings inaccurate assumptions regarding future rental or occupancy rates could result in overly optimistic estimates of future revenues similarly we may underestimate future operating expenses or the costs necessary to bring properties up to standards established for their intended use if we have difficulties with any of these areas or if we later discover additional liabilities or experience unforeseen costs relating to our acquired companies we might not achieve the economic benefits we expect from our acquisitions and this may materially adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

from time to time we have made and in the future we may seek to make one or more material acquisitions which may involve the expenditure of significant funds 

we regularly review potential transactions in order to maximize shareholder value and believe that currently there are available a number of acquisition opportunities that would be complementary to our business given the recent industry consolidation trend in connection with our review of such transactions we regularly engage in discussions with potential acquisition candidates some of which are material any future acquisitions could require the issuance of securities the incurrence of debt assumption of contingent liabilities or incurrence of significant expenditures any of which could materially adversely impact our business financial condition or results of operations in addition the financing required for such acquisitions may not be available on commercially favorable terms or at all 

loss of our key personnel could temporarily disrupt our operations and adversely affect us 

we are dependent on the efforts of our executive officers and competition for these individuals is intense although our chief executive officer chief financial officer chief investment officer and general counsel have employment agreements with us we cannot assure you that they will remain employed with us the loss or limited availability of the services of any of our executive officers or our inability to recruit and retain qualified personnel in the future could at least temporarily have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition and be negatively perceived in the capital markets 

we may experience uninsured or underinsured losses which could result in a significant loss of the capital we have invested in a property decrease anticipated future revenues or cause us to incur unanticipated expense 

we maintain comprehensive insurance coverage on our properties with terms conditions limits and deductibles that we believe are adequate and appropriate given the relative risk and costs of such coverage and we continually review the insurance maintained by us however a large number of our properties are located in areas exposed to earthquake windstorm flood and other natural disasters and 

may be subject to other losses in particular our life science portfolio is concentrated in areas known to be subject to earthquake activity while we purchase insurance for earthquake windstorm flood and other natural disasters that we believe is adequate in light of current industry practice and analysis prepared by outside consultants there is no assurance that such insurance will fully cover such losses these losses can decrease our anticipated revenues from a property and result in the loss of all or a portion of the capital we have invested in a property the insurance market for such exposures can be very volatile and we may be unable to purchase the limits and terms we desire on a commercially reasonable basis in the future in addition there are certain exposures where insurance is not purchased as we do not believe it is economically feasible to do so or where there is no viable insurance market 

environmental compliance costs and liabilities associated with our real estate related investments may materially impair the value of those investments 

under various federal state and local laws ordinances and regulations as a current or previous owner of real estate we may be required to investigate and clean up certain hazardous or toxic substances or petroleum released at a property and may be held liable to a governmental entity or to third parties for property damage and for investigation and cleanup costs incurred by the third parties in connection with the contamination in addition some environmental laws create a lien on the contaminated site in favor of the government for damages and the costs it incurs in connection with the contamination although we i currently carry environmental insurance on our properties in an amount and subject to deductibles that we believe are commercially reasonable and ii generally require our operators and tenants to undertake to indemnify us for environmental liabilities they cause such liabilities could exceed the amount of our insurance the financial ability of the tenant or operator to indemnify us or the value of the contaminated property the presence of contamination or the failure to remediate contamination may materially adversely affect our ability to sell or lease the real estate or to borrow using the real estate as collateral as the owner of a site we may also be held liable under common law to third parties for damages and injuries resulting from environmental contamination emanating from the site although we are generally indemnified by the current operators or tenants of our properties for contamination caused by them these indemnities may not adequately cover all environmental costs we may also experience environmental liabilities arising from conditions not known to us 

the bankruptcy insolvency or financial deterioration of one or more of our major operators or tenants may materially adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

we lease our properties directly to operators in most cases and in certain other cases we lease to thirdparty tenants who enter into longterm management agreements with operators to manage the properties although our leases financing arrangements and other agreements with our tenants and operators generally provide us the right under specified circumstances to terminate a lease evict an operator or tenant or demand immediate repayment of certain obligations to us the bankruptcy and insolvency laws afford certain rights to a party that has filed for bankruptcy or reorganization that may render certain of these remedies unenforceable or at the least delay our ability to pursue such remedies for example we cannot evict a tenant or operator solely because of its bankruptcy filing a debtor has the right to assume or to assume and assign to a third party or to reject its unexpired contracts in a bankruptcy proceeding if a debtor were to reject its leases with us our claim against the debtor for unpaid and future rents would be limited by the statutory cap set forth in the us bankruptcy code which may be substantially less than the remaining rent actually owed under the lease in addition the inability of our tenants or operators to make payments or comply with certain other lease obligations may affect our compliance with certain covenants contained in our debt securities credit facilities and the mortgages on the properties leased or managed by such tenants and operators in addition under certain conditions defaults under the underlying mortgages may result in 

crossdefault under our other indebtedness although we believe that we would be able to secure amendments under the applicable agreements in those circumstances the bankruptcy of an applicable operator or tenant may potentially result in less favorable borrowing terms than currently available delays in the availability of funding or other material adverse consequences in addition many of our facilities are leased to health care providers who provide longterm custodial care to the elderly evicting such operators for failure to pay rent while the facility is occupied may be a difficult and slow process and may not be successful 

the current us housing market may adversely affect our operators and tenants ability to increase or maintain occupancy levels at and rental income from our senior housing facilities 

our tenants and operators may have relatively flat or declining occupancy levels in the nearterm due to falling home prices declining incomes stagnant home sales and other economic factors seniors may choose to postpone their plans to move into senior housing facilities rather than sell their homes at a loss or for a profit below their expectations moreover tightening lending standards have made it more difficult for potential buyers to obtain mortgage financing all of which have contributed to the declining home sales in addition the senior housing segment may continue to experience a decline in occupancy associated with private pay residents choosing to move out of the facilities to be cared for at home by relatives due to the weak economy a material decline in our tenants and operators occupancy levels and revenues may make it more difficult for them to meet their financial obligations to us which could materially adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

operators and tenants that fail to comply with the requirements of governmental reimbursement programs such as medicare or medicaid may cease to operate or be unable to meet their financial and other contractual obligations to us 

certain of our operators and tenants are affected by an extremely complex set of federal state and local laws and regulations that are subject to frequent and substantial changes sometimes applied retroactively resulting from legislation adoption of rules and regulations and administrative and judicial interpretations of existing law see item 1—business—government regulation licensing and enforcement above for example to the extent that any of our operators or tenants receive a significant portion of their revenues from governmental payors primarily medicare and medicaid such revenues may be subject to 

• statutory and regulatory changes • retroactive rate adjustments • recovery of program overpayments or setoffs • administrative rulings • policy interpretations • payment or other delays by fiscal intermediaries or carriers • government funding restrictions at a program level or with respect to specific facilities and • interruption or delays in payments due to any ongoing governmental investigations and audits at such property in recent years governmental payors have frozen or reduced payments to healthcare providers due to budgetary pressures healthcare reimbursement will likely continue to be of significant importance to federal and state authorities we cannot make any assessment as to the ultimate timing or the effect that any future legislative reforms may have on our operators and tenants costs of doing business and on the amount of reimbursement by government and other thirdparty payors the failure of any of our 

operators or tenants to comply with these laws requirements and regulations could materially adversely affect their ability to meet their financial and contractual obligations to us 

operators and tenants that fail to comply with federal state and local licensure certification and inspection laws and regulations may cease to operate or be unable to meet their financial and other contractual obligations to us 

certain of our operators and tenants are subject to extensive federal state local and industryrelated licensure certification and inspection laws regulations and standards our operators or tenants failure to comply with any of these laws regulations or standards could result in loss of accreditation denial of reimbursement imposition of fines suspension or decertification from federal and state healthcare programs loss of license or closure of the facility for example certain of our properties may require a license registration andor certificate of need to operate failure of any operator or tenant to obtain a license registration or certificate of need or loss of a required license registration or certificate of need would prevent a facility from operating in the manner intended by such operator or tenant additionally failure of our operators and tenants to generally comply with applicable laws and regulations may have an adverse effect on facilities owned by or mortgaged to us and therefore may materially adversely impact us see item 1—business—government regulation licensing and enforcement—healthcare licensure and certificate of need above 

the impact of the comprehensive healthcare regulation enacted in 2010 on us and operators and tenants cannot accurately be predicted 

legislative proposals are introduced or proposed in congress and in some state legislatures each year that would affect major changes in the healthcare system either nationally or at the state level notably in march 2010 president obama signed into law the patient protection and affordable care act along with the health care and education reconciliation act of 2010 collectively the affordable care act the passage of the affordable care act has resulted in comprehensive reform legislation that is expected to expand health care coverage to millions of currently uninsured people beginning in 2014 and provide for significant changes to the us healthcare system over the next ten years to help fund this expansion the affordable care act outlines certain reductions in medicare reimbursement rates for various healthcare providers including longterm acute care hospitals and skilled nursing facilities as well as certain other changes to medicare payment methodologies this comprehensive health care legislation provides for extensive future rulemaking by regulatory authorities and also may be altered or amended we cannot accurately predict whether any pending legislative proposals will be adopted or if adopted what effect if any these proposals would have on our operators and tenants and thus our business similarly while we can anticipate that some of the rulemaking that will be promulgated by regulatory authorities will affect our operators and tenants and the manner in which they are reimbursed by the federal health care programs we cannot accurately predict today the impact of those regulations on our operators and tenants and thus on our business 

increased competition as well as an inability to grow revenues as originally forecast have resulted and may further result in lower net revenues for some of our operators and tenants and may affect their ability to meet their financial and other contractual obligations to us 

the healthcare industry is highly competitive and can become more competitive in the future the occupancy levels at and rental income from our facilities is dependent on our ability and the ability of our operators and tenants to maintain and increase such levels and income and to compete with entities that have substantial capital resources these entities compete with other operators and tenants on a number of different levels including the quality of care provided reputation the physical appearance of a facility price the range of services offered family preference alternatives for healthcare delivery the supply of competing properties physicians staff referral sources location and 

the size and demographics of the population in the surrounding area private federal and state payment programs and the effect of laws and regulations may also have a significant influence on the profitability of the properties and their tenants our operators and tenants also compete with numerous other companies providing similar healthcare services or alternatives such as home health agencies life care at home communitybased service programs retirement communities and convalescent centers such competition which has intensified due to overbuilding in some segments in which we invest has caused the occupancy rate of newly constructed buildings to slow and the monthly rate that many newly built and previously existing facilities were able to obtain for their services to decrease we cannot be certain that the operators and tenants of all of our facilities will be able to achieve occupancy and rate levels that will enable them to meet all of their obligations to us further many competing companies may have resources and attributes that are superior to those of our operators and tenants thus our operators and tenants may encounter increased competition in the future that could limit their ability to maintain or attract residents or expand their businesses which could materially adversely affect their ability to meet their financial and other contractual obligations to us potentially decreasing our revenues impairing our assets and increasing our collection and dispute costs 

our operators and tenants may not procure the necessary insurance to adequately insure against losses 

our leases generally require our tenants and operators to secure and maintain comprehensive liability and property insurance that covers us as well as the tenants and operators some types of losses may not be adequately insured by our tenants and operators should an uninsured loss or a loss in excess of insured limits occur we could incur liability or lose all or a portion of the capital we have invested in a property as well as the anticipated future revenues from the property in such an event we might nevertheless remain obligated for any mortgage debt or other financial obligations related to the property we continually review the insurance maintained by our tenants and operators and believe the coverage provided to be customary for similarly situated companies in our industry however we cannot assure you that material uninsured losses or losses in excess of insurance proceeds will not occur in the future 

our operators and tenants are faced with litigation and may experience rising liability and insurance costs 

in some states advocacy groups have been created to monitor the quality of care at healthcare facilities and these groups have brought litigation against the operators and tenants of such facilities also in several instances private litigation by patients has succeeded in winning large damage awards for alleged abuses the effect of this litigation and other potential litigation may materially increase the costs incurred by our operators and tenants for monitoring and reporting quality of care compliance in addition their cost of liability and medical malpractice insurance can be significant and may increase so long as the present healthcare litigation environment continues cost increases could cause our operators to be unable to make their lease or mortgage payments or fail to purchase the appropriate liability and malpractice insurance potentially decreasing our revenues and increasing our collection and litigation costs in addition as a result of our ownership of healthcare facilities we may be named as a defendant in lawsuits allegedly arising from the actions of our operators or tenants for which claims such operators and tenants have agreed to indemnify defend and hold us harmless from and against but which may require unanticipated expenditures on our part 

our tenants in the life science industry face high levels of regulation expense and uncertainty 

life science tenants particularly those involved in developing and marketing pharmaceutical products are subject to certain unique risks as follows 

• some of our tenants require significant outlays of funds for the research development and clinical testing of their products and technologies if private investors the government or other sources of funding are unavailable to support such activities a tenants business may be adversely affected or fail 22 

• the research development clinical testing manufacture and marketing of some of our tenants products require federal state and foreign regulatory approvals which may be costly or difficult to obtain • even after a life science tenant gains regulatory approval and market acceptance the product may still present significant regulatory and liability risks including among others the possible later discovery of safety concerns competition from new products and ultimately the expiration of patent protection for the product • our tenants with marketable products may be adversely affected by healthcare reform and the reimbursement policies of government or private healthcare payors and • our tenants may be unable to adequately protect their intellectual property under patent copyright or trade secret laws we cannot assure you that our life science tenants will be successful in their businesses if our tenants businesses are adversely affected they may have difficulty making payments to us which could materially adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

tax and reitrelated risks 

loss of our tax status as a reit would substantially reduce our available funds and would have material adverse consequences for us and the value of our common stock 

qualification as a reit involves the application of numerous highly technical and complex provisions of the internal revenue code of 1986 as amended the code for which there are only limited judicial and administrative interpretations as well as the determination of various factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control we intend to continue to operate in a manner that enables us to qualify as a reit however our qualification and taxation as a reit depend upon our ability to meet through actual annual operating results asset diversification distribution levels and diversity of stock ownership the various qualification tests imposed under the code for example to qualify as a reit at least 95 of our gross income in any year must be derived from qualifying sources and we must make distributions to our stockholders aggregating annually at least 90 of our reit taxable income excluding net capital gains in addition new legislation regulations administrative interpretations or court decisions could change the tax laws or interpretations of the tax laws regarding qualification as a reit or the federal income tax consequences of that qualification in a manner that is materially adverse to our stockholders accordingly there is no assurance that we have operated or will continue to operate in a manner so as to qualify or remain qualified as a reit 

if we lose our reit status we will face serious tax consequences that will substantially reduce the funds available to make payments of principal and interest on the debt securities we issue and to make distributions to stockholders if we fail to qualify as a reit 

• we will not be allowed a deduction for distributions to stockholders in computing our taxable income • we will be subject to corporatelevel income tax including any applicable alternative minimum tax on our taxable income at regular corporate rates • we could be subject to increased state and local income taxes and • unless we are entitled to relief under relevant statutory provisions we will be disqualified from taxation as a reit for the four taxable years following the year during which we fail to qualify as a reit 23 

as a result of all these factors our failure to qualify as a reit also could impair our ability to expand our business and raise capital and could materially adversely affect the value of our common stock 

certain property transfers may generate prohibited transaction income resulting in a penalty tax on gain attributable to the transaction 

from time to time we may transfer or otherwise dispose of some of our properties under the code any gain resulting from transfers of properties that we hold as inventory or primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business would be treated as income from a prohibited transaction subject to a 100 penalty tax since we acquire properties for investment purposes we do not believe that our occasional transfers of property are prohibited transactions however the determination that a transfer constitutes a prohibited transaction is based on the facts and circumstances surrounding each transfer the internal revenue service irs may contend that certain transfers of properties by us are prohibited transactions while we believe that the irs would not prevail in any such dispute if the irs were to argue successfully that a transfer of property constituted a prohibited transaction then we would be required to pay a 100 penalty tax on any gain from the prohibited transaction in addition income from a prohibited transaction might materially adversely affect our ability to satisfy the income tests for qualification as a reit for federal income tax purposes 

certain properties are leased to our trss pursuant to the provisions of ridea 

we currently lease certain qualified healthcare properties to our trss or a limited liability company of which the trs is a member these trss in turn contract with thirdparty operators to manage the healthcare operations at these properties the rents paid by the trss in this ridea structure will be treated as qualifying rents from real property if i they are paid pursuant to an armslength lease of a qualified healthcare property and ii the operator qualifies as an eligible independent contractor with respect to the property an operator will qualify as an eligible independent contractor if it meets certain ownership tests with respect to hcp inc and if at the time the operator enters into the management agreement the operator is actively engaged in the trade or business of operating qualified healthcare properties for any person who is not a related person to hcp inc or the lessee if any of the above conditions are not satisfied then the rents will not be considered income from a qualifying source as discussed above 

we could have potential deferred and contingent tax liabilities from corporate acquisitions that could limit delay or impede future sales of our properties 

if during the tenyear period beginning on the date we acquire certain companies we recognize gain on the disposition of any property acquired then to the extent of the excess of i the fair market value of such property as of the acquisition date over ii our adjusted income tax basis in such property as of that date we will be required to pay a corporatelevel federal income tax on this gain at the highest regular corporate rate there can be no assurance that these triggering dispositions will not occur and these requirements could limit delay or impede future sales of our properties 

in addition the irs may assert liabilities against us for corporate income taxes for taxable years prior to the time that we acquire certain companies in which case we will owe these taxes plus interest and penalties if any 

there are uncertainties relating to the calculation of nonreit tax earnings and profits ep in certain acquisitions which may require us to distribute ep 

in order to remain qualified as a reit we are required to distribute to our stockholders all of the accumulated nonreit ep of certain companies that we acquire prior to the close of the first 

taxable year in which the acquisition occurs failure to make such ep distributions would result in our disqualification as a reit the determination of the amount to be distributed in such ep distributions is a complex factual and legal determination we may have less than complete information at the time we undertake our analysis or we may interpret the applicable law differently from the irs we currently believe that we have satisfied the requirements relating to such ep distributions there are however substantial uncertainties relating to the determination of ep including the possibility that the irs could successfully assert that the taxable income of the companies acquired should be increased which would increase our nonreit ep moreover an audit of the acquired company following our acquisition could result in an increase in accumulated nonreit ep which could require us to pay an additional taxable distribution to our thenexisting stockholders if we qualify under rules for curing this type of default or could result in our disqualification as a reit 

thus we might fail to satisfy the requirement that we distribute all of our nonreit ep by the close of the first taxable year in which the acquisition occurs moreover although there are procedures available to cure a failure to distribute all of our ep we cannot now determine whether we will be able to take advantage of these procedures or the economic impact on us of doing so 

risks related to our legal organizational structure 

our charter contains ownership limits with respect to our common stock and other classes of capital stock 

our charter contains restrictions on the ownership and transfer of our common stock and preferred stock that are intended to assist us in preserving our qualification as a reit under our charter subject to certain exceptions no person or entity may own actually or constructively more than 98 by value or by number of shares whichever is more restrictive of the outstanding shares of our common stock or any class or series of our preferred stock 

additionally our charter has a 99 ownership limitation on the direct or indirect ownership of our voting shares which may include common stock or other classes of capital stock our board of directors in its sole discretion may exempt a proposed transferee from either ownership limit the ownership limits may delay defer or prevent a transaction or a change of control that might involve a premium price for our common stock or might otherwise be in the best interests of our stockholders 

we are subject to certain provisions of maryland law and our charter relating to business combinations 

the maryland business combination act provides that unless exempted a maryland corporation may not engage in business combinations including a merger consolidation share exchange or in circumstances specified in the statute an asset transfer or issuance or reclassification of equity securities with an interested stockholder or an affiliate of an interested stockholder for five years after the most recent date on which the interested stockholder became an interested stockholder and thereafter unless specified criteria are met an interested stockholder is generally a person owning or controlling directly or indirectly 10 or more of the voting power of the outstanding voting stock of a maryland corporation unless our board of directors takes action to exempt us generally or with respect to certain transactions from this statute in the future the maryland business combination act will be applicable to business combinations between us and other persons 

in addition to the restrictions on business combinations contained in the maryland business combination act our charter also contains restrictions on business combinations our charter requires that except in certain circumstances business combinations including a merger or consolidation and certain asset transfers and issuances of securities with a related person including a beneficial owner of 10 or more of our outstanding voting stock be approved by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 90 of our outstanding voting stock 

the restrictions on business combinations provided under maryland law and contained in our charter may delay defer or prevent a change of control or other transaction even if such transaction involves a premium price for our common stock or our stockholders believe that such transaction is otherwise in their best interests

• executive summary • 2011 transaction overview • dividends • critical accounting policies • results of operations • liquidity and capital resources • nongaap financial measure—funds from operations • offbalance sheet arrangements • contractual obligations • inflation • recent accounting pronouncements executive summary 

we are a selfadministered reit that together with our unconsolidated joint ventures invests primarily in real estate serving the healthcare industry in the us we acquire develop lease manage and dispose of healthcare real estate and provide financing to healthcare providers at december 31 2011 our portfolio of investments including properties owned by our investment management platform consisted of interests in 1010 facilities 

our business strategy is based on three principles i opportunistic investing ii portfolio diversification and iii conservative financing we actively redeploy capital from investments with lower return potential into assets with higher return potential we make investments where the 

expected riskadjusted return exceeds our cost of capital and strive to capitalize on our operator tenant and other business relationships to grow our business 

our strategy contemplates acquiring and developing properties on terms that are favorable to us generally we prefer larger more complex private transactions that leverage our management teams experience and our infrastructure we follow a disciplined approach to enhancing the value of our existing portfolio including ongoing evaluation of potential disposition of properties that no longer fit our strategy 

we primarily generate revenue by leasing healthcare properties under longterm leases with fixed or inflation indexed escalators most of our rents and other earned income from leases are received under triplenet leases or leases that provide for substantial recovery of operating expenses however some of our medical office and life science leases are structured as gross or modified gross leases accordingly for such mobs and life science facilities we incur certain property operating expenses such as real estate taxes repairs and maintenance property management fees utilities and insurance our growth for these assets depends in part on our ability to i increase rental income and other earned income from leases by increasing rental rates and occupancy levels ii maximize tenant recoveries given underlying lease structures and iii control operating and other expenses our operations are impacted by property specific market specific general economic and other conditions at december 31 2011 the contractual maturities in our portfolio of leased assets were 12 through 2014 measured in dollars of expiring rents 

access to capital markets impacts our cost of capital and ability to refinance maturing indebtedness as well as to fund future acquisitions and development through the issuance of additional securities or secured debt access to external capital on favorable terms is critical to the success of our strategy

critical accounting policies 

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap requires our management to use judgment in the application of accounting policies including making estimates and assumptions we base estimates on our experience and on various other assumptions believed to be reasonable under the circumstances these estimates affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods if our judgment or interpretation of the facts and circumstances relating to various transactions or other matters had been different it is possible that different accounting would have been applied resulting in a different presentation of our consolidated financial statements from time to time we reevaluate our estimates and assumptions in the event estimates or assumptions prove to be different from actual results adjustments are made in subsequent periods to reflect more current estimates and assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain for a more detailed discussion of our significant accounting policies see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements below is a discussion of accounting policies that we consider critical in that they may require complex judgment in their application or require estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain 

principles of consolidation 

the consolidated financial statements include the accounts of hcp inc our wholly owned subsidiaries and joint ventures that we control through voting rights or other means we consolidate investments in variable interest entities vies when we are the primary beneficiary of the vie at i the inception of the variable interest entity ii as a result of a change in circumstance identified during our continuous review of our vie relationships or iii upon the occurrence of a qualifying reconsideration event 

we make judgments with respect to our level of influence or control of an entity and whether we are or are not the primary beneficiary of a vie consideration of various factors includes but is not limited to our ability to direct the activities that most significantly impact the entitys economic performance our form of ownership interest our representation on the entitys governing body the size and seniority of our investment our ability and the rights of other investors to participate in policy making decisions replace the manager andor liquidate the entity if applicable our ability to correctly assess our influence or control over an entity when determining the primary beneficiary of a vie affects the presentation of these entities in our consolidated financial statements if we perform a primary beneficiary analysis at a date other than at inception of the variable interest entity our assumptions may be different and may result in the identification of a different primary beneficiary 

if we determine that we are the primary beneficiary of a vie our consolidated financial statements would include the operating results of the vie either tenant or borrower rather than the results of the variable interest in the vie we would depend on the vie to provide us timely financial 

information and rely on the internal control of the vie to provide accurate financial information if the vie has deficiencies in its internal control over financial reporting or does not provide us with timely financial information this may adversely impact the quality andor timing of our financial reporting and our internal control over financial reporting 

revenue recognition 

we recognize rental revenue on a straightline basis over the lease term when collectibility is reasonably assured and the tenant has taken possession or controls the physical use of the leased asset for assets acquired subject to leases we recognize revenue upon acquisition of the asset provided the tenant has taken possession or controls the physical use of the leased asset if the lease provides for tenant improvements we determine whether the tenant improvements for accounting purposes are owned by the tenant or us when we are the owner of the tenant improvements the tenant is not considered to have taken physical possession or have control of the physical use of the leased asset until the tenant improvements are substantially completed when the tenant is the owner of the tenant improvements any tenant improvement allowance funded is treated as a lease incentive and amortized as a reduction of revenue over the lease term the determination of ownership of the tenant improvements is subject to significant judgment if our assessment of the owner of the tenant improvements for accounting purposes were to change the timing and amount of our revenue recognized would be impacted 

certain leases provide for additional rents contingent upon a percentage of the facilitys revenue in excess of specified base amounts or other thresholds such revenue is recognized when actual results reported by the tenant or estimates of tenant results exceed the base amount or other thresholds the recognition of additional rents requires us to make estimates of amounts owed and to a certain extent are dependent on the accuracy of the facility results reported to us our estimates may differ from actual results which could be material to our consolidated financial statements 

we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts including an allowance for straightline rent receivables for estimated losses resulting from tenant defaults or the inability of tenants to make contractual rent and tenant recovery payments we monitor the liquidity and creditworthiness of our tenants and operators on an ongoing basis this evaluation considers industry and economic conditions property performance credit enhancements and other factors for straightline rent amounts our assessment is based on income recoverable over the term of the lease we exercise judgment in establishing allowances and consider payment history and current credit status in developing these estimates these estimates may differ from actual results which could be material to our consolidated financial statements 

loans receivable are classified as heldforinvestment based on managements intent and ability to hold the loans for the foreseeable future or to maturity we recognize interest income on loans including the amortization of discounts and premiums using the interest method applied on a loanbyloan basis when collectibility of the future payments is reasonably assured premiums discounts and related costs are recognized as yield adjustments over the life of the related loans 

we use the direct finance method of accounting to record income from dfls for leases accounted for as dfls future minimum lease payments are recorded as a receivable the difference between the future minimum lease payments and the estimated residual values less the cost of the properties is recorded as unearned income unearned income is deferred and amortized to income over the lease terms to provide a constant yield when collectibility of the lease payments is reasonably assured investments in dfls are presented net of unamortized unearned income 

loans and dfls are placed on nonaccrual status at such time as management determines that collectibility of contractual amounts is not reasonably assured while on nonaccrual status loans or dfls are either accounted for on a cash basis in which income is recognized only upon receipt of 

cash or on a costrecovery basis in which all cash receipts reduce the carrying value of the loan or dfl based on managements judgment of collectibility 

allowances are established for loans and dfls based upon a probable loss estimate for individual loans and dfls deemed to be impaired loans and dfls are impaired when it is deemed probable that we will be unable to collect all amounts due on a timely basis in accordance with the contractual terms of the loan or lease determining the adequacy of the allowance is complex and requires significant judgment by us about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain the allowance is based upon our assessment of the borrowers or lessees overall financial condition resources and payment record the prospects for support from any financially responsible guarantors and if appropriate the realizable value of any collateral these estimates consider all available evidence including as appropriate the present value of the expected future cash flows discounted at the loans or dfls effective interest rate the fair value of collateral general economic conditions and trends historical and industry loss experience and other relevant factors while our assumptions are based in part upon historical data our estimates may differ from actual results which could be material to our consolidated financial statements 

real estate 

we make estimates as part of our allocation of the purchase price of acquisitions to the various components of the acquisition based upon the relative fair value of each component the most significant components of our allocations are typically the allocation of fair value to the buildings asifvacant land and inplace leases in the case of the fair value of buildings and the allocation of value to land and other intangibles our estimates of the values of these components will affect the amount of depreciation and amortization we record over the estimated useful life of the property acquired or the remaining lease term in the case of the value of inplace leases we make our best estimates based on our evaluation of the specific characteristics of each tenants lease factors considered include estimates of carrying costs during hypothetical expected leaseup periods market conditions and costs to execute similar leases our assumptions affect the amount of future revenue that we will recognize over the remaining lease term for the acquired inplace leases 

a variety of costs are incurred in the development and leasing of properties after determination is made to capitalize a cost it is allocated to the specific component of a project that is benefited determination of when a development project is substantially complete and capitalization must cease involves a degree of judgment the costs of land and buildings under development include specifically identifiable costs the capitalized costs include preconstruction costs essential to the development of the property development costs construction costs interest costs real estate taxes and other costs incurred during the period of development we consider a construction project as substantially completed and held available for occupancy and cease capitalization of costs upon the completion of the related tenant improvements 

impairment of longlived assets and goodwill 

we assess the carrying value of our real estate assets and related intangibles real estate assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable recoverability of real estate assets is measured by comparison of the carrying amount of the asset or asset group to the respective estimated future undiscounted cash flows in order to review our real estate assets for recoverability we consider market conditions as well as our intent with respect to holding or disposing of the asset fair value is determined through various valuation techniques including discounted cash flow models quoted market values and third party appraisals where considered necessary if our analysis indicates that the carrying value of the real estate asset is not recoverable on an undiscounted cash flow basis we recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the real estate asset 

goodwill is tested for impairment at least annually if it is determined based on certain qualitative factors that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount we apply the twostep approach certain qualitative factors assessed by us include current macroeconomic conditions state of the equity and capital markets and the overall financial and operating performance of hcp if we qualitatively determine that it is more likely than not the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount the twostep approach is necessary 

if the fair value of a reporting unit containing goodwill is less than its carrying value then the second step of the test is needed to measure the amount of potential goodwill impairment the second step requires the fair value of a reporting unit to be allocated to all the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination at the date of the impairment test the excess of the fair value of the reporting unit over the fair value of assets and liabilities is the implied value of goodwill and is used to determine the amount of impairment we estimate the current fair value of the assets and liabilities in the reporting unit through various valuation techniques including applying capitalization rates to segment net operating income quoted market values and thirdparty appraisals as necessary the fair value of the reporting unit may also include an allocation of an enterprise value premium that we estimate a third party would be willing to pay for the company 

the determination of the fair value of real estate assets and goodwill involves significant judgment this judgment is based on our analysis and estimates of fair value of real estate assets and reporting units and the future operating results and resulting cash flows of each real estate asset whose carrying amount may not be recoverable our ability to accurately predict future operating results and cash flows and estimate and allocate fair values impacts the timing and recognition of impairments while we believe our assumptions are reasonable changes in these assumptions may have a material impact on our financial results 

investments in unconsolidated joint ventures 

investments in entities which we do not consolidate but have the ability to exercise significant influence over operating and financial policies are reported under the equity method of accounting under the equity method of accounting our share of the investees earnings or losses are included in our consolidated results of operations 

the initial carrying value of investments in unconsolidated joint ventures is based on the amount paid to purchase the joint venture interest or the carrying value of the assets prior to the sale of interests in the joint venture we evaluate our equity method investments for impairment based upon a comparison of the fair value of the equity method investment to our carrying value if we determine a decline in the fair value of our investment in an unconsolidated joint venture is below its carrying value is otherthantemporary an impairment is recorded the determination of the fair value and as to whether a deficiency in fair value is otherthantemporary of investments in unconsolidated joint ventures involves significant judgment our estimates consider all available evidence including as appropriate the present value of the expected future cash flows discounted at market rates general economic conditions and trends severity and duration of the fair value deficiency and other relevant factors capitalization rates discount rates and credit spreads utilized in our valuation models are based upon rates that we believe to be within a reasonable range of current market rates for the respective investments while we believe our assumptions are reasonable changes in these assumptions may have a material impact on our financial results 

income taxes 

as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements significant management judgment is required to evaluate our compliance with reit requirements our determinations are 

based on interpretation of tax laws and our conclusions may have an impact on the income tax expense recognized adjustments to income tax expense may be required as a result of i audits conducted by federal state and local tax authorities ii our ability to qualify as a reit iii the potential for builtingain recognized related to priortaxfree acquisitions of c corporations and iv changes in tax laws adjustments required in any given period are included in income other than adjustments to income tax liabilities acquired in business combinations which are adjusted through goodwill 

results of operations 

we evaluate our business and allocate resources among our five business segments i senior housing ii postacuteskilled nursing iii life science iv medical office and v hospital under the senior housing life science postacuteskilled nursing and hospital segments we invest or coinvest primarily in single operator or tenant properties through the acquisition and development of real estate management of operations and by debt issued by operators in these sectors under the medical office segment we invest or coinvest through the acquisition and development of mobs that are leased under gross modified gross or triplenet leases generally to multiple tenants and which generally require a greater level of property management the accounting policies of the segments are the same as those described in the summary of significant accounting policies see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements

liquidity and capital resources 

our principal liquidity needs are to i fund recurring operating expenses ii meet debt service requirements including 250 million of senior unsecured notes and 67 million of mortgage debt principal payments and maturities in 2012 iii fund capital expenditures including tenant improvements and leasing costs iv fund acquisition and development activities and v make dividend distributions we believe these needs will be satisfied using cash flows generated by operations and from our various financing activities during the next twelve months during the year ended december 31 2011 distributions to shareholders and noncontrolling interest holders exceeded cash flows from operations by approximately 79 million during 2011 we utilized the funds available under our revolving line of credit facility which borrowings among other things were the sources of cash used to fund the excess of distributions to shareholders and noncontrolling interest holders above cash flows from operations 

access to capital markets impacts our cost of capital and ability to refinance maturing indebtedness as well as our ability to fund future acquisitions and development through the issuance of additional securities or secured debt credit ratings impact our ability to access capital and directly impact our cost of capital as well for example as noted below our revolving line of credit facility 

accrues interest at a rate per annum equal to libor plus a margin that depends upon our debt ratings we also pay a facility fee on the entire revolving commitment that depends upon our debt ratings as of january 31 2011 we had a credit rating of baa2 stable from moodys bbb positive from sp and bbb stable from fitch on our senior unsecured debt securities and baa3 stable from moodys bb positive from sp and bbb stable from fitch on our preferred equity securities 

net cash provided by operating activities was 724 million and 580 million for the years ended december 31 2011 and 2010 respectively the increase in operating cash flows is primarily the result of the following i the additive impact of our acquisitions in 2010 and 2011 ii assets placed in service in 2010 and 2011 and iii rent escalations and resets in 2010 and 2011 these increases were partially offset by 227 million in payments relating to the ventas litigation our cash flows from operations are dependent upon the occupancy level of multitenant buildings rental rates on leases our tenants performance on their lease obligations the level of operating expenses and other factors 

net cash used by investing activities was 46 billion and 431 million for the years ended december 31 2011 and 2010 respectively the cash used in investing activities for the year ended december 31 2011 principally reflects the net effects of i 40 billion used for our hcr manorcare acquisition ii 370 million used for investments in loans receivable iii 198 million used for acquisition and development of other real estate iv 136 million used in the acquisition of our partners 65 interest in hcp ventures ii v 95 million used to purchase a noncontrolling equity interest in the operations of hcr manorcare propco and vi 53 million used for leasing costs and tenant and capital improvements which were partially offset by 304 million received from the repayments from our investments in loans receivable 

net cash provided by financing activities was 29 billion and 775 million for the years ended december 31 2011 and 2010 respectively the cash provided by financing activities for the year ended december 31 2011 consisted primarily of i the issuance of senior unsecured notes of 24 billion ii net proceeds of 13 billion from the issuances of common stock and exercise of stock options and iii net borrowings of 454 million from our revolving line of credit facility the amount of cash provided by financing activities was partially offset by i payments of common and preferred dividends aggregating 788 million ii repayment of senior unsecured notes of 292 million iii repayment of mortgage debt of 170 million iv debt issuance costs of 44 million and v the purchase of noncontrolling interests of 34 million 

debt 

bank line of credit our revolving line of credit facility provides for an aggregate borrowing capacity of 15 billion and matures on march 11 2015 with a oneyear committed extension option we have the right to increase the commitments under the revolving line of credit facility by an aggregate amount of up to 500 million subject to customary conditions borrowings under this revolving line of credit facility accrue interest at a rate per annum equal to libor plus a margin that depends on our debt ratings we pay a facility fee on the entire revolving commitment that depends upon our debt ratings based on our debt ratings at december 31 2011 the margin on the revolving line of credit facility was 150 and the facility fee was 030 at december 31 2011 we had 454 million outstanding under this revolving line of credit facility with a weightedaverage effective interest rate of 226 

our revolving line of credit facility contains certain financial restrictions and other customary requirements among other things these covenants using terms defined in the agreement i limit the ratio of consolidated total indebtedness to consolidated total asset value to 60 ii limit the ratio of secured debt to consolidated total asset value to 30 iii limit the ratio of unsecured debt to consolidated unencumbered asset value to 60 iv require a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio 

of 15 times and v require a formuladetermined minimum consolidated tangible net worth of 80 billion at december 31 2011 at december 31 2011 we were in compliance with each of these restrictions and requirements of our revolving line of credit facility 

our revolving line of credit facility also contains crossdefault provisions to other indebtedness of ours including in some instances certain mortgages on our properties certain mortgages contain default provisions relating to defaults under the leases or operating agreements on the applicable properties by our operators or tenants including default provisions relating to the bankruptcy filings of such operator or tenant although we believe that we would be able to secure amendments under the applicable agreements if a default as described above occurs such a default may result in significantly less favorable borrowing terms than currently available material delays in the availability of funding or other material adverse consequences 

senior unsecured notes at december 31 2011 we had senior unsecured notes outstanding with an aggregate principal balance of 54 billion at december 31 2011 interest rates on the notes ranged from 145 to 707 with a weighted average effective rate of 570 and a weighted average maturity of 634 years discounts and premiums are amortized to interest expense over the term of the related notes the senior unsecured notes contain certain covenants including limitations on debt crossacceleration provisions and other customary terms at december 31 2011 we believe we were in compliance with these covenants 

mortgage debt at december 31 2011 we had 18 billion in aggregate principal amount of mortgage debt secured by 138 healthcare facilities including redevelopment properties that had a carrying amount of 22 billion at december 31 2011 interest rates on the mortgage debt range from 196 to 878 with a weighted average effective interest rate of 612 and a weighted average maturity of 437 years 

mortgage debt generally requires monthly principal and interest payments is collateralized by certain properties and is generally nonrecourse mortgage debt typically restricts transfer of the encumbered properties prohibits additional liens restricts prepayment requires payment of real estate taxes requires maintenance of the properties in good condition requires maintenance of insurance on the properties and includes requirements to obtain lender consent to enter into and terminate material leases some of the mortgage debt is also crosscollateralized by multiple properties and may require tenants or operators to maintain compliance with the applicable leases or operating agreements of such properties 

other debt at december 31 2011 we had 88 million of noninterest bearing life care bonds at two of our ccrcs and noninterest bearing occupancy fee deposits at another of our senior housing facility all of which were payable to certain residents of the facilities collectively life care bonds at december 31 2011 31 million of the life care bonds are refundable to the residents upon the resident moving out or to their estate upon death and 57 million of the life care bonds are refundable after the unit is successfully remarketed to a new resident

shelf registration 

we have a prospectus on file with the sec as part of a registration statement on form s3 using a shelf registration process that expires in september 2012 under this shelf process we may sell from time to time any combination of the registered securities in one or more offerings the securities described in the prospectus include common stock preferred stock and debt securities each time we sell securities under the shelf registration we will provide a prospectus supplement that will contain specific information about the terms of the securities being offered and of the offering we may offer and sell the securities pursuant to this prospectus from time to time in one or more of the following ways through underwriters or dealers through agents directly to purchasers or through a combination of any of these methods of sales proceeds from the sale of these securities may be used for general corporate purposes which may include repayment of indebtedness working capital and potential acquisitions 

nongaap financial measure—funds from operations ffo 

we believe ffo applicable to common shares diluted ffo applicable to common shares and basic and diluted ffo per common share are important supplemental measures of operating performance for a real estate investment trust because the historical cost accounting convention used for real estate assets utilizes straightline depreciation except on land such accounting presentation implies that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time since real estate values instead have historically risen and fallen with market conditions presentations of operating results for a real estate investment trust that uses historical cost accounting for depreciation could be less informative the term ffo was designed by the real estate investment trust industry to address this issue 

ffo is defined as net income applicable to common shares computed in accordance with gaap excluding gains or losses from acquisition and dispositions of depreciable real estate or related interests impairments of or related to depreciable real estate plus real estate and dfl depreciation and amortization with adjustments for joint ventures adjustments for joint ventures are calculated to reflect ffo on the same basis ffo does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with gaap is not necessarily indicative of cash available to fund cash needs and should not be considered an alternative to net income our computation of ffo may not be comparable to ffo reported by other real estate investment trusts that do not define the term in accordance with the current national association of real estate investment trusts nareit definition or that have a different interpretation of the current nareit definition from us in addition we present ffo before the impact of litigation settlement and provision charges other impairments other impairment recoveries and mergerrelated items ffo as adjusted management believes ffo as adjusted is a useful alternative measurement this measure is a modification of the nareit definition of ffo and should not be used as an alternative to net income 

nareit recently issued updated reporting guidance that directs companies for their computation of nareit ffo to exclude impairments of depreciable real estate and other assets when writedowns are driven by measurable decreases in the fair value of real estate holdings eg investments in joint ventures that primarily hold real estate previously the companys calculation of ffo consistent with nareits previous guidance did not exclude impairments of or related to depreciable real estate consistent with this current nareit reporting guidance the company has restated its 2010 and 2009 ffo amounts 

details of certain items that affect comparability are discussed in the financials results summary of our financial results for the year ended december 31 2011 2010 and 2009 the following is a 

reconciliation from net income applicable to common shares the most direct comparable financial measure calculated and presented with gaap to ffo dollars and shares in thousands 





1 the litigation settlement charge during the year ended december 31 2011 relates to the ventas settlement the litigation provision during the year ended december 31 2009 relates to the ventas compensatory damages of approximately 102 million awarded by the jury on september 4 2009 2 the following impairments net of recoveries had an impact on ffo • the impairment charge during the year ended december 31 2011 relates to our senior secured loan to cirrus health • recoveries for the year ended december 31 2010 relate to portions of previous impairment charges related to investments in three direct financing leases nondepreciable due to lessee purchase option and a participation interest in a senior construction loan related to erickson • the year ended december 31 2009 includes impairments of 674 million as a result of i an aggregate 631 million provision related to dfl and loan losses impairment charges related to the bankruptcy of erickson and ii 43 million related to a senior secured loan to cirrus health as a result of an expected restructuring of terms to the loan 3 mergerrelated items for the year ended december 31 2011 are attributable to the hcr manorcare acquisition incurred from january 1st through april 6th 2011 which include the following i 268 million of direct transaction costs ii 239 million of interest expense associated with the 24 billion senior unsecured notes issued on january 24 2011 proceeds from which were obtained to prefund the hcr manorcare acquisition partially offset by iii 241 million of income related to gains upon the reinvestment of the our debt investment in hcr manorcare and other miscellaneous items mergerrelated items for 2010 primarily include professional fees associated with our hcr manorcare acquisition 4 our weighted average shares used to calculate diluted ffo as adjusted eliminate the impact of 46 million shares of common stock from our december 2010 offering and 30 million shares from our march 2011 common stock offering excludes 45 million shares sold to the underwriters upon exercise of their option to purchase additional shares which issuances increased our weighted average shares by 129 million and 15 million for the years ended december 31 2011 and 2010 respectively proceeds from these offerings were used to fund a portion of the cash consideration for the hcr manorcare acquisition offbalance sheet arrangements 

we own interests in certain unconsolidated joint ventures as described under note 8 to the consolidated financial statements except in limited circumstances our risk of loss is limited to our investment in the joint venture and any outstanding loans receivable in addition we have certain properties which serve as collateral for debt that is owed by a previous owner of certain of our facilities as described under note 12 to the consolidated financial statements included our risk of loss for these properties is limited to the outstanding debt balance plus penalties if any we have no other material offbalance sheet arrangements that we expect would materially affect our liquidity and capital resources except those described below under contractual obligations 

contractual obligations 

the following table summarizes our material contractual payment obligations and commitments at december 31 2011 in thousands 



1 excludes 88 million of other debt that represents noninterest bearing life care bonds and occupancy fee deposits at certain of our senior housing facilities which have no scheduled maturities 2 represents commitments to finance development projects and related working capital financings 3 represents construction and other commitments for developments in progress 4 interest on variablerate debt is calculated using rates in effect at december 31 2011 inflation 

our leases often provide for either fixed increases in base rents or indexed escalators based on the consumer price index or other measures andor additional rent based on increases in the tenants operating revenues substantially all of our mob leases require the tenant to pay a share of property operating costs such as real estate taxes insurance and utilities substantially all of our senior housing life science postacuteskilled nursing and hospital leases require the operator or tenant to pay all of the property operating costs or reimburse us for all such costs we believe that inflationary increases in expenses will be offset in part by the operator or tenant expense reimbursements and contractual rent increases described above 

recent accounting pronouncements 

see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for the impact of new accounting standards there were no accounting pronouncements that were issued but not yet adopted by us that we believe will materially impact our consolidated financial statements 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

interest rate risk at december 31 2011 we were exposed to market risks related to fluctuations in interest rates on the following i 454 million of variablerate line of credit borrowings ii 25 million of variablerate senior unsecured notes and iii 24 million of variablerate mortgage debt payable excluding 88 million of variablerate mortgage notes that have been hedged through interestrate swap contracts that are partially offset by properties with a gross value of 83 million that are subject to leases where the payments fluctuate with changes in libor 

interest rate fluctuations will generally not affect our future earnings or cash flows on our fixed rate debt and loans receivable unless such instruments mature or are otherwise terminated however interest rate changes will affect the fair value of our fixed rate instruments conversely changes in interest rates on variable rate debt and investments would change our future earnings and cash flows 

but not significantly affect the fair value of those instruments assuming a one percentage point increase in the interest rate related to the variablerate debt and variablerate investments and assuming no other changes in the outstanding balance as of december 31 2011 annual net interest expense would increase by approximately 42 million or 001 per common share on a diluted basis 

we use derivative financial instruments in the normal course of business to mitigate interest rate risk we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes derivatives are recorded on the consolidated balance sheet at their fair value see note 24 to the consolidated financial statements for further information 

to illustrate the effect of movements in the interest rate markets we performed a market sensitivity analysis on our hedging instruments we applied various basis point spreads to the underlying interest rate curves of the derivative portfolio in order to determine the instruments change in fair value assuming a one percentage point change in the underlying interest rate curve the estimated change in fair value of each of the underlying derivative instruments would not exceed 38 million see note 24 to the consolidated financial statements for additional analysis details 

market risk we have investments in marketable equity securities classified as availableforsale gains and losses on these securities are recognized in income when realized and losses are recognized when an otherthantemporary decline in value is identified an initial indicator of otherthantemporary decline in value for marketable equity securities is based on the severity of the decline in market value below the cost basis for an extended period of time we consider a variety of factors in evaluating an otherthantemporary decline in value such as the length of time and the extent to which the market value has been less than our current cost basis the issuers financial condition capital strength and nearterm prospects any recent events specific to that issuer and economic conditions of its industry and our investment horizon in relationship to an anticipated nearterm recovery in the market value if any at december 31 2011 the fair value and current cost basis of marketable equity securities were both 171 million 

the principal amount and the average interest rates for our loans receivable and debt categorized by maturity dates is presented in the table below the fair value for our senior unsecured notes payable is based on prevailing market prices the fair value estimates for loans receivable and mortgage debt payable are based on discounting future cash flows utilizing current rates for loans and debt of the same type and remaining maturity 



1 effective january 1 2011 a senior secured loan to cirrus was placed on nonaccrual status for additional information regarding the senior secured loan to cirrus see note 7 to the consolidated financial statements 2 excludes 88 million of other debt that represents noninterest bearing life care bonds and occupancy fee deposits at certain of our senior housing facilities which have no scheduled maturities 59

 item 1 business 

business overview 

hcp an sp 500 company invests primarily in real estate serving the healthcare industry in the united states we are a selfadministered maryland real estate investment trust reit organized in 1985 we are headquartered in long beach california with offices in nashville tennessee and san francisco california we acquire develop lease manage and dispose of healthcare real estate and provide financing to healthcare providers our portfolio is comprised of investments in the following five healthcare segments i senior housing ii life science iii medical office iv postacuteskilled nursing and v hospital we make investments within our healthcare segments using the following five investment products i properties under lease ii debt investments iii developments and redevelopments iv investment management and v downreits 

the delivery of healthcare services requires real estate and as a result tenants and operators depend on real estate in part to maintain and grow their businesses we believe that the healthcare real estate market provides investment opportunities due to the following 

• compelling demographics driving the demand for healthcare services • specialized nature of healthcare real estate investing and • ongoing consolidation of the fragmented healthcare real estate sector our website address is wwwhcpicom  our annual reports on form 10k quarterly reports on form 10q current reports on form 8k and any amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to section 13a or 15d of the securities exchange act of 1934 the exchange act are available on our website free of charge as soon as reasonably practicable after we electronically file such materials with or furnish them to the united states us securities and exchange commission sec

business strategy 

our primary goal is to increase shareholder value through profitable growth our investment strategy to achieve this goal is based on three principles i opportunistic investing ii portfolio diversification and iii conservative financing 

opportunistic investing 

we make investment decisions that are expected to drive profitable growth and create shareholder value we attempt to position ourselves to create and take advantage of situations to meet our goals and investment criteria 

portfolio diversification 

we believe in maintaining a portfolio of healthcare investments diversified by segment geography operator tenant and investment product diversification reduces the likelihood that a single event would materially harm our business and allows us to take advantage of opportunities in different markets based on individual market dynamics while pursuing our strategy of diversification we monitor but do not limit our investments based on the percentage of our total assets that may be invested in any one property type investment product geographic location the number of properties which we may lease to a single operator or tenant or loans we may make to a single borrower with investments in multiple segments and investment products we can focus on opportunities with the most attractive riskreward profile for the portfolio as a whole we may structure transactions as master leases require operator or tenant insurance and indemnifications obtain enhancements in the form of guarantees letters of credit or security deposits and take other measures to mitigate risk 

conservative financing 

we believe a conservative balance sheet is important to our ability to execute our opportunistic investing approach we strive to maintain a conservative balance sheet by actively managing our debttoequity levels and maintaining multiple sources of liquidity such as our revolving line of credit facility access to capital markets and secured debt lenders relationships with current and prospective institutional joint venture partners and our ability to divest of assets our debt obligations are primarily fixed rate which reduces the impact of rising interest rates on our operations 

we finance our investments based on our evaluation of available sources of funding for shortterm purposes we may utilize our revolving line of credit facility or arrange for other shortterm borrowings from banks or other sources we arrange for longerterm financing through offerings of equity and debt securities placement of mortgage debt and capital from other institutional lenders and equity investors 

we specifically incorporate by reference into this section the information set forth in item 7 2010 transaction overview included elsewhere in this report 

competition 

investing in real estate serving the healthcare industry is highly competitive we face competition from other reits investment companies private equity and hedge fund investors sovereign funds healthcare operators lenders developers and other institutional investors some of whom may have greater resources and lower costs of capital than us increased competition makes it more challenging for us to identify and successfully capitalize on opportunities that meet our objectives our ability to compete may also be impacted by national and local economic trends availability of investment alternatives availability and cost of capital construction and renovation costs existing laws and regulations new legislation and population trends 

rental and related income from our facilities is dependent on the ability of our operators and tenants to compete with other companies on a number of different levels including the quality of care provided reputation the physical appearance of a facility price and range of services offered alternatives for healthcare delivery the supply of competing properties physicians staff referral sources location the size and demographics of the population in surrounding areas and the financial condition of our tenants and operators private federal and state payment programs as well as the effect of laws and regulations may also have a significant influence on the profitability of our tenants and operators for a discussion of the risks associated with competitive conditions affecting our business see risk factors in item 1a 

healthcare segments 

senior housing at december 31 2010 we had interests in 251 senior housing facilities including 25 facilities owned by our investment management platform senior housing facilities include independent living facilities ilfs assisted living facilities alfs and continuing care retirement communities ccrcs which cater to different segments of the elderly population based upon their needs services provided by our operators or tenants in these facilities are primarily paid for by the residents directly or through private insurance and are less reliant on government reimbursement programs such as medicaid and medicare our senior housing property types are further described below 

• independent living facilities ilfs are designed to meet the needs of seniors who choose to live in an environment surrounded by their peers with services such as housekeeping meals and activities these residents generally do not need assistance with activities of daily living adl such as bathing eating and dressing however residents have the option to contract for these services at december 31 2010 we had interests in 45 ilfs • assisted living facilities alfs are licensed care facilities that provide personal care services support and housing for those who need help with adl yet require limited medical care the programs and services may include transportation social activities exercise and fitness programs beauty or barber shop access hobby and craft activities community excursions meals in a dining room setting and other activities sought by residents these facilities are often in apartmentlike buildings with private residences ranging from single rooms to large apartments certain alfs may offer higher levels of personal assistance for residents with alzheimers disease or other 5 

forms of dementia levels of personal assistance are based in part on local regulations at december 31 2010 we had interests in 194 alfs

1 percentage of total revenues from hca includes revenues earned from both our medical office and hospital segments during the year ended december 31 2010 we sold our remaining hca debt investments of 141 million which contributed 10 million of interest income during 2010 investment products 

properties under lease we primarily generate revenue by leasing properties under longterm leases most of our rents and other earned income from leases are received under triplenet leases or leases that provide for a substantial recovery of operating expenses however some of our mobs and life science facility rents are structured under gross or modified gross leases accordingly for such gross or modified gross leases we incur certain property operating expenses such as real estate taxes repairs and maintenance property management fees utilities and insurance 

our ability to grow income from properties under lease depends in part on our ability to i increase rental income and other earned income from leases by increasing rental rates and occupancy levels ii maximize tenant recoveries and iii control nonrecoverable operating expenses most of our leases include contractual annual base rent escalation clauses that are either predetermined fixed increases andor are a function of an inflation index 

debt investments our mezzanine loans are generally secured by a pledge of ownership interests of an entity or entities which directly or indirectly own properties and are subordinate to more senior debt including mortgages and more senior mezzanine loans our interests in mortgages are issued by healthcare providers and are generally secured by healthcare real estate 

developments and redevelopments we generally commit to development projects that are at least 50 preleased or when we believe that market conditions will support speculative construction we work closely with our local real estate service providers including brokerage property management project management and construction management companies to assist us in evaluating development proposals and completing developments our development and redevelopment investments are primarily in our life science and medical office segments redevelopments are properties that require significant capital expenditures generally more than 25 of acquisition cost or existing basis to achieve property stabilization or to change the primary use of the properties 

investment management we coinvest in real estate properties with institutional investors through joint ventures structured as partnerships or limited liability companies we target institutional investors with longterm investment horizons who seek to benefit from our expertise in healthcare real estate predominantly we retain noncontrolling interests in the joint ventures ranging from 20 to 35 and serve as the managing member these ventures generally allow us to earn acquisition and asset management fees and have the potential for promoted interests or incentive distributions based on performance of the joint venture 

nonmanaging member llc downreits our downreit structures enable us to acquire and hold real estate in operating downreit limited liability companies llcs in connection with the formation of certain downreit llcs many members contribute appreciated real estate to the downreit llc in exchange for downreit units that can be exchanged at some future date for shares of our stock or at our election redeemed for cash these contributions are generally taxdeferred so that the precontribution gain related to the real estate is not taxed to the contributing member however if the contributed real estate is later sold by the downreit llc the unamortized precontribution gain that exists at the date of sale is specifically allocated and taxed to the contributing members in many of these downreits we entered into indemnification agreements with our members under which if any of the appreciated real estate contributed by the members is sold by the downreit in a taxable transaction within a specified number of years after the property was contributed we will reimburse the affected members for the income taxes associated with the precontribution gain that is specifically allocated to the affected member since the formation of our first downreit llc we have acquired more than 10 billion of real estate utilizing downreit structures

government regulation licensing and enforcement 

overview 

our tenants and operators are typically subject to extensive and complex federal state and local healthcare laws and regulations relating to fraud and abuse practices government reimbursement licensure and certificate of need and similar laws governing the operation of healthcare facilities these regulations are wideranging and can subject our tenants and operators to civil criminal and administrative sanctions affected tenants and operators may find it increasingly difficult to comply with this complex and evolving regulatory environment because of a relative lack of guidance in many areas as certain of our healthcare properties are subject to oversight from several government agencies and the laws may vary from one jurisdiction to another changes in laws and regulations and reimbursement enforcement activity and regulatory noncompliance by our tenants and operators can all have a significant effect on their operations and financial condition which in turn may adversely impact us as detailed below and set forth under risk factors in item 1a 

we seek to mitigate the risk to us resulting from the significant healthcare regulatory risks faced by our tenants and operators by diversifying our portfolio among property types and geographical areas diversifying our tenant and operator base to limit our exposure to any single entity and seeking tenants and operators who are not largely dependent on medicaid reimbursement for their revenues based on information primarily provided by our tenants and operators excluding our medical office segment at december 31 2010 we estimate that approximately 7 and 4 of the annualized base rental payments received from our tenants and operators are dependant on medicare and medicaid reimbursement respectively 

the following is a discussion of certain laws and regulations generally applicable to our operators and in certain cases to us 

fraud and abuse enforcement 

there are various extremely complex federal and state laws and regulations governing healthcare providers relationships and arrangements and prohibiting fraudulent and abusive practices by such providers these laws include i federal and state false claims acts which among other things prohibit providers from filing false claims or making false statements to receive payment from medicare medicaid or other federal or state healthcare programs ii federal and state antikickback and feesplitting statutes including the medicare and medicaid antikickback statute which prohibit the payment or receipt of remuneration to induce referrals or recommendations of healthcare items or services iii federal and state physician selfreferral laws commonly referred to as the stark law which generally prohibit referrals by physicians to entities with which the physician or an immediate family member has a financial relationship iv the federal civil monetary penalties law which prohibits among other things the knowing presentation of a false or fraudulent claim for certain healthcare services and v federal and state privacy laws including the privacy and security rules contained in the health insurance portability and accountability act of 1997 which provide for the privacy and security of personal health information violations of healthcare fraud and abuse laws carry civil criminal and administrative sanctions including punitive sanctions monetary penalties imprisonment denial of medicare and medicaid reimbursement and potential exclusion from medicare medicaid or other federal or state healthcare programs these laws are enforced by a variety of federal state and local agencies and can also be enforced by private litigants through among other things federal and state false claims acts which allow private litigants to bring qui tam or whistleblower actions many of our operators and tenants are subject to these laws and some of them may in the future become the subject of governmental enforcement actions if they fail to comply with applicable laws 

reimbursement 

sources of revenue for many of our tenants and operators include among other sources governmental healthcare programs such as the federal medicare program and state medicaid programs and nongovernmental payors such as insurance carriers and health maintenance organizations as federal and state governments focus on healthcare reform initiatives and as many states face significant budget deficits efforts to reduce costs by these payors will likely continue which may result in reduced or slower growth in reimbursement for certain services provided by some of our tenants and operators 

healthcare licensure and certificate of need 

certain healthcare facilities in our portfolio are subject to extensive federal state and local licensure certification and inspection laws and regulations in addition various licenses and permits are required to dispense narcotics operate pharmacies handle radioactive materials and operate equipment many states require certain healthcare providers to obtain a certificate of need which requires prior approval for the construction expansion and closure of certain healthcare facilities the approval process related to state certificate of need laws may impact some of our tenants and operators abilities to expand or change their businesses 

life science facilities 

while certain of our life science tenants include some wellestablished companies other such tenants are less established and in some cases may not yet have a product approved by the food and drug administration or other regulatory authorities for commercial sale creating a new 

pharmaceutical product requires substantial investments of time and money in part because of the extensive regulation of the healthcare industry it also entails considerable risk of failure in demonstrating that the product is safe and effective and in gaining regulatory approval and market acceptance 

senior housing entrance fee communities 

certain of the senior housing facilities mortgaged to or owned by us are operated as entrance fee communities generally an entrance fee is an upfront fee or consideration paid by a resident a portion of which may be refundable in exchange for some form of longterm benefit some of the entrance fee communities are subject to significant state regulatory oversight including for example oversight of each facilitys financial condition establishment and monitoring of reserve requirements and other financial restrictions the right of residents to cancel their contracts within a specified period of time lien rights in favor of the residents restrictions on change of ownership and similar matters 

americans with disabilities act the ada 

our properties must comply with the ada and any similar state or local laws to the extent that such properties are public accommodations as defined in those statutes the ada may require removal of barriers to access by persons with disabilities in certain public areas of our properties where such removal is readily achievable to date we have not received any notices of noncompliance with the ada that have caused us to incur substantial capital expenditures to address ada concerns should barriers to access by persons with disabilities be discovered at any of our properties we may be directly or indirectly responsible for additional costs that may be required to make facilities adacompliant noncompliance with the ada could result in the imposition of fines or an award of damages to private litigants the obligation to make readily achievable accommodations pursuant to the ada is an ongoing one and we continue to assess our properties and make modifications as appropriate in this respect 

environmental matters 

a wide variety of federal state and local environmental and occupational health and safety laws and regulations affect healthcare facility operations these complex federal and state statutes and their enforcement involve myriad regulations many of which involve strict liability on the part of the potential offender some of these federal and state statutes may directly impact us under various federal state and local environmental laws ordinances and regulations an owner of real property or a secured lender such as us may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of hazardous or toxic substances at under or disposed of in connection with such property as well as other potential costs relating to hazardous or toxic substances including government fines and damages for injuries to persons and adjacent property the cost of any required remediation removal fines or personal or property damages and the owners or secured lenders liability therefore could exceed or impair the value of the property andor the assets of the owner or secured lender in addition the presence of such substances or the failure to properly dispose of or remediate such substances may adversely affect the owners ability to sell or rent such property or to borrow using such property as collateral which in turn could reduce our revenues for a description of the risks associated with environmental matters see risk factors in item 1a of this report 




 item 1a risk factors 

  the section below discusses the most significant risk factors that may materially adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

as set forth below we believe that the risks facing our company generally fall into the following four categories 

• risks related to our business • risks related to tax matters including reitrelated risks and • risks related to our legal organizational structure risks related to our business 

volatility in the financial markets may impair our ability to raise capital obtain new financing or refinance existing obligations and fund real estate and development activities 

the global financial markets recently have undergone and may continue to experience pervasive and fundamental disruptions while the capital markets have shown signs of improvement the sustainability of an economic recovery is uncertain and additional levels of market disruption and volatility could materially adversely impact our ability to raise capital obtain new financing or refinance our existing obligations as they mature and fund real estate and development activities 

market volatility could also lead to significant uncertainty in the valuation of our investments and those of our joint ventures that may result in a substantial decrease in the value of our properties and those of our joint ventures as a result we may not be able to recover the carrying amount of such investments and the associated goodwill if any which may require us to recognize impairment charges in earnings 

we rely on external sources of capital to fund future capital needs and if our access to such capital is unavailable limited or on unfavorable terms we may not be able to meet commitments as they become due or make future investments necessary to grow our business 

we may not be able to fund from cash retained from operations all future capital needs if we are unable to obtain internally needed capital we might not be able to make the investments needed to grow our business and to meet our obligations and commitments as they mature as a result we rely on external sources of capital including debt and equity financing to fulfill our capital requirements our access to capital depends upon a number of factors some of which we have little or no control over including but not limited to 

• general availability of credit and market conditions including rising interest rates and increased borrowing cost • the market price of the shares of our equity securities and the credit ratings of our debt and preferred securities • the markets perception of our growth potential and our current and potential future earnings and cash distributions • our degree of financial leverage and operational flexibility • financial integrity of our lenders that might impair their ability to meet their commitments to us or their willingness to make additional loans to us and our inability to replace the financing commitment of any such lender on favorable terms or at all • the stability in the market value of our properties 14 

• the financial performance of our operators tenants and borrowers and • issues facing the healthcare industry including but not limited to healthcare reform and changes in government reimbursement policies if our access to capital is limited by these factors or other factors it could have a material adverse impact on our ability to refinance our debt obligations fund dividend payments acquire properties and fund operations and development activities 

adverse changes in our credit ratings could impair our ability to obtain additional debt and equity financing on favorable terms if at all and negatively impact the market price of our securities including our common stock 

the credit ratings of our senior unsecured debt and preferred equity securities are based on our operating performance liquidity and leverage ratios overall financial position and other factors employed by the credit rating agencies in their rating analyses of us our credit ratings can affect the amount and type of capital we can access as well as the terms of any financings we may obtain there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain our current credit ratings and in the event that our current credit ratings deteriorate we would likely incur higher borrowing costs and it may be more difficult or expensive to obtain additional financing or refinance existing obligations and commitments also a downgrade in our credit ratings would trigger additional costs or other potentially negative consequences under our current and future credit facilities and debt instruments 

our level of indebtedness may increase and materially adversely affect our future operations 

our indebtedness as of december 31 2010 was approximately 46 billion and after giving effect to the sale of unsecured notes issued on january 24 2011 was approximately 70 billion we may incur additional indebtedness in the future including in connection with the development or acquisition of assets which may be substantial any significant additional indebtedness could negatively affect the credit ratings of our debt and require a substantial portion of our cash flow to make interest and principal payments due on our indebtedness greater demands on our cash resources may reduce funds available to us to pay dividends conduct development activities make capital expenditures and acquisitions or carry out other aspects of our business strategy increased indebtedness can also limit our ability to adjust rapidly to changing market conditions make us more vulnerable to general adverse economic and industry conditions and create competitive disadvantages for us compared to other companies with relatively lower debt levels increased future debt service obligations may limit our operational flexibility including our ability to finance or refinance our properties contribute properties to joint ventures or sell properties as needed 

covenants related to our indebtedness limit our operational flexibility and breaches of these covenants could materially adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

our unsecured credit facilities unsecured debt securities and secured debt and other indebtedness that we may incur in the future require or will require us to comply with a number of customary financial and other covenants such as maintaining certain levels of debt service coverage leverage ratio tangible net worth requirements and reit status our continued ability to incur indebtedness and operate in general is subject to compliance with these financial and other covenants which limit our operational flexibility for example mortgages on our properties contain customary covenants such as those that limit or restrict our ability without the consent of the lender to further encumber or sell the applicable properties or to replace the applicable tenant or operator breaches of certain covenants may result in defaults under the mortgages on our properties and crossdefaults under certain of our other indebtedness even if we satisfy our payment obligations to the respective obligee additionally defaults under the leases or operating agreements related to mortgaged properties including defaults 

associated with the bankruptcy of the applicable tenant or operator may result in a default under the underlying mortgage and crossdefaults under certain of our other indebtedness covenants that limit our operational flexibility as well as defaults under our debt instruments could materially adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

an increase in interest rates could increase interest cost on new debt and could materially adversely impact our ability to refinance existing debt sell assets and limit our acquisition and development activities 

if interest rates increase so could our interest costs for any new debt this increased cost could make the financing of any acquisition and development activity more costly rising interest rates could limit our ability to refinance existing debt when it matures or cause us to pay higher interest rates upon refinancing and increase interest expense on refinanced indebtedness in addition an increase in interest rates could decrease the amount third parties are willing to pay for our assets thereby limiting our ability to reposition our portfolio promptly in response to changes in economic or other conditions 

unfavorable resolution of pending and future litigation matters and disputes could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition 

from time to time we may be directly involved in a number of legal proceedings lawsuits and other claims see legal proceedings in part i item 3 in this report for a discussion of certain legal proceedings in which we are involved we may also be named as defendants in lawsuits allegedly arising out of our actions or the actions of our operators and tenants in which such operators and tenants have agreed to indemnify defend and hold us harmless from and against various claims litigation and liabilities arising in connection with their respective businesses an unfavorable resolution of pending or future litigation may have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition regardless of its outcome litigation may result in substantial costs and expenses and significantly divert the attention of management there can be no assurance that we will be able to prevail in or achieve a favorable settlement of pending or future litigation in addition pending litigation or future litigation government proceedings or environmental matters could lead to increased costs or interruption of our normal business operations 

a small number of operators tenants and borrowers account for a large percentage of our revenues 

during the year ended december 31 2010 approximately 38 of our total revenues are generated by our leasing or financial arrangements with the following five companies emeritus 10 hcr manorcare 9 sunrise 8 hca 6 and brookdale 5 upon closing the anticipated hcr manorcare acquisition in march 2011 revenues earned from hcr manorcare will increase significantly the failure or inability of these operators tenants or borrowers to meet their obligations to us could materially reduce our cash flow as well as our results of operations which could in turn reduce the amount of dividends we pay cause our stock price to decline and have other material adverse effects on our business results of operations and financial condition 

we may be unable to successfully foreclose on the collateral securing our real estaterelated loans and even if we are successful in our foreclosure efforts we may be unable to successfully operate or occupy the underlying real estate which may adversely affect our ability to recover our investments 

if an operator or tenant defaults under one of our mortgages or mezzanine loans we may have to foreclose on the loan or protect our interest by acquiring title to the collateral in some cases as noted above the collateral consists of the equity interests in an entity that directly or indirectly owns the applicable real property and accordingly we may not have full recourse to assets of that entity operators tenants or borrowers may contest enforcement of foreclosure or other remedies seek bankruptcy protection against our exercise of enforcement or other remedies andor bring claims for lender liability in response to actions to enforce mortgage obligations foreclosurerelated costs high 

loantovalue ratios or declines in the value of the facility may prevent us from realizing an amount equal to our mortgage or mezzanine loan upon foreclosure even if we are able to successfully foreclose on the collateral securing our real estaterelated loans we may inherit properties for which we may be unable to expeditiously seek tenants or operators if at all which would adversely affect our ability to fully recover our investment 

required regulatory approvals can delay or prohibit transfers of our healthcare facilities 

transfers of healthcare facilities to successor tenants or operators may be subject to regulatory approvals including change of ownership approvals under certificate of need laws and medicare and medicaid provider arrangements that are not required for transfers of other types of commercial operations and other types of real estate the replacement of any tenant or operator could be delayed by the regulatory approval process of any federal state or local government agency necessary for the transfer of the facility or the replacement of the operator licensed to manage the facility if we are unable to find a suitable replacement tenant or operator upon favorable terms or at all we may take possession of a facility which might expose us to successor liability or require us to indemnify subsequent operators to whom we might transfer the operating rights and licenses all of which may materially adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

competition may make it difficult to identify and purchase or develop suitable healthcare facilities to grow our investment portfolio 

we face significant competition from other reits investment companies private equity and hedge fund investors sovereign funds healthcare operators lenders developers and other institutional investors some of whom may have greater resources and lower costs of capital than us increased competition makes it more challenging for us to identify and successfully capitalize on opportunities that meet our business goals if we cannot capitalize on our development pipeline identify and purchase a sufficient quantity of healthcare facilities at favorable prices or if we are unable to finance acquisitions on commercially favorable terms our business results of operations and financial condition may be materially adversely affected 

we may be required to incur substantial renovation costs to make certain of our healthcare properties suitable for other operators and tenants 

healthcare facilities are typically highly customized and may not be easily adapted to nonhealthcarerelated uses the improvements generally required to conform a property to healthcare use such as upgrading electrical gas and plumbing infrastructure are costly and at times tenantspecific a new or replacement operator or tenant may require different features in a property depending on that operators or tenants particular operations if a current operator or tenant is unable to pay rent and vacates a property we may incur substantial expenditures to modify a property before we are able to secure another operator or tenant also if the property needs to be renovated to accommodate multiple operators or tenants we may incur substantial expenditures before we are able to release the space these expenditures or renovations may materially adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

we face additional risks associated with property development that can render a project less profitable or not profitable at all and under certain circumstances prevent completion of development activities once undertaken 

largescale groundup development of healthcare properties presents additional risks for us including risks that 

• a development opportunity may be abandoned after expending significant resources resulting in the loss of deposits or failure to recover expenses already incurred • the development and construction costs of a project may exceed original estimates due to increased interest rates and higher materials transportation labor leasing or other costs which could make the completion of the development project less profitable • construction andor permanent financing may not be available on favorable terms or at all • the project may not be completed on schedule which can result in increases in construction costs and debt service expenses as a result of a variety of factors that are beyond our control including natural disasters labor conditions material shortages regulatory hurdles civil unrest and acts of war and • occupancy rates and rents at a newly completed property may not meet expected levels and could be insufficient to make the property profitable these risks could result in substantial unanticipated delays or expenses and under certain circumstances could prevent completion of development activities once undertaken any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

our use of joint ventures may limit our flexibility with jointly owned investments 

we may develop andor acquire properties in joint ventures with other persons or entities when circumstances warrant the use of these structures our participation in joint ventures is subject to risks that 

• we could experience an impasse on certain decisions because we do not have sole decisionmaking authority which could require us to expend additional resources on resolving such impasses or potential disputes • our joint venture partners could have investment goals that are not consistent with our investment objectives including the timing terms and strategies for any investments • our joint venture partners might become bankrupt fail to fund their share of required capital contributions or fail to fulfill their obligations as a joint venture partner which may require us to infuse our own capital into the venture on behalf of the partner despite other competing uses for such capital and • our joint venture partners may have competing interests in our markets that could create conflict of interest issues from time to time we acquire other companies and if we are unable to successfully integrate these operations our business results of operations and financial condition may be materially adversely affected 

acquisitions require the integration of companies that have previously operated independently successful integration of the operations of these companies depends primarily on our ability to consolidate operations systems procedures properties and personnel and to eliminate redundancies and costs we may encounter difficulties in these integrations potential difficulties associated with acquisitions include the loss of key employees the disruption of our ongoing business or that of the 

acquired entity possible inconsistencies in standards controls procedures and policies and the assumption of unexpected liabilities in addition the acquired companies and their properties may fail to perform as expected including in respect of estimated cost savings inaccurate assumptions regarding future rental or occupancy rates could result in overly optimistic estimates of future revenues similarly we may underestimate future operating expenses or the costs necessary to bring properties up to standards established for their intended use if we have difficulties with any of these areas or if we later discover additional liabilities or experience unforeseen costs relating to our acquired companies we might not achieve the economic benefits we expect from our acquisitions and this may materially adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

from time to time we have made and in the future we may seek to make one or more material acquisitions which may involve the expenditure of significant funds 

we regularly review potential transactions in order to maximize shareholder value and believe that currently there are available a number of acquisition opportunities that would be complementary to our business given the recent industry consolidation trend in connection with our review of such transactions we regularly engage in discussions with potential acquisition candidates some of which are material any future acquisitions could require the issuance of securities the incurrence of debt assumption of contingent liabilities or incurrence of significant expenditures any of which could materially adversely impact our business financial condition or results of operations in addition the financing required for such acquisitions may not be available on commercially favorable terms or at all 

loss of our key personnel could temporarily disrupt our operations and adversely affect us 

we are dependent on the efforts of our executive officers although our chief executive officer has an employment agreement with us we cannot assure you that he will remain employed with us the loss or limited availability of the services of our chief executive officer or any of our executive officers or our inability to recruit and retain qualified personnel in the future could at least temporarily have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition and be negatively perceived in the capital markets 

we may experience uninsured or underinsured losses which could result in a significant loss of the capital we have invested in a property decrease anticipated future revenues or cause us to incur unanticipated expense 

we maintain comprehensive insurance coverage on our properties with terms conditions limits and deductibles that we believe are adequate and appropriate given the relative risk and costs of such coverage however a large number of our properties are located in areas exposed to earthquake windstorm flood and other natural disasters and may be subject to other losses in particular our life science portfolio is concentrated in areas known to be subject to earthquake activity while we purchase insurance for earthquake windstorm flood and other natural disasters that we believe is adequate in light of current industry practice and analysis prepared by outside consultants there is no assurance that such insurance will fully cover such losses these losses can decrease our anticipated revenues from a property and result in the loss of all or a portion of the capital we have invested in a property the insurance market for such exposures can be very volatile and we may be unable to purchase the limits and terms we desire on a commercially reasonable basis in the future in addition there are certain exposures where insurance is not purchased as we do not believe it is economically feasible to do so or where there is no viable insurance market 

environmental compliance costs and liabilities associated with our real estate related investments may materially impair the value of those investments 

under various federal state and local laws ordinances and regulations as a current or previous owner of real estate we may be required to investigate and clean up certain hazardous substances released at a property and may be held liable to a governmental entity or to third parties for property damage and for investigation and cleanup costs incurred by the third parties in connection with the contamination in addition some environmental laws create a lien on the contaminated site in favor of the government for damages and the costs it incurs in connection with the contamination although we i currently carry environmental insurance on our properties in an amount and subject to deductibles that we believe are commercially reasonable and ii generally require our operators and tenants to undertake to indemnify us for environmental liabilities they cause such liabilities could exceed the amount of our insurance the financial ability of the tenant or operator to indemnify us or the value of the contaminated property the presence of contamination or the failure to remediate contamination may materially adversely affect our ability to sell or lease the real estate or to borrow using the real estate as collateral as the owner of a site we may also be held liable under common law to third parties for damages and injuries resulting from environmental contamination emanating from the site we may also experience environmental liabilities arising from conditions not known to us 

the bankruptcy insolvency or financial deterioration of one or more of our major operators or tenants may materially adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

we lease our properties directly to operators in most cases and in certain other cases we lease to thirdparty tenants who enter into longterm management agreements with operators to manage the properties although our leases financing arrangements and other agreements with our tenants and operators generally provide us the right under specified circumstances to terminate a lease evict an operator or tenant or demand immediate repayment of certain obligations to us the bankruptcy laws afford certain rights to a party that has filed for bankruptcy or reorganization that may render certain of these remedies unenforceable or at the least delay our ability to pursue such remedies for example we cannot evict a tenant or operator solely because of its bankruptcy filing a debtor has the right to assume or to assume and assign to a third party or reject its unexpired contracts in a bankruptcy proceeding if a debtor were to reject its leases with us our claim against the debtor for unpaid and future rents would be limited by the statutory cap set forth in the us bankruptcy code which may be substantially less than the remaining rent actually owed under the lease in addition the inability of our tenants or operators to make payments or comply with certain other lease obligations may affect our compliance with certain covenants contained in our debt securities credit facilities and the mortgages on the properties leased or managed by such tenants and operators in addition under certain conditions defaults under the underlying mortgages may result in crossdefault under our other indebtedness although we believe that we would be able to secure amendments under the applicable agreements in those circumstances the bankruptcy of an applicable operator or tenant may potentially result in less favorable borrowing terms than currently available delays in the availability of funding or other material adverse consequences in addition many of our facilities are leased to health care providers who provide longterm custodial care to the elderly evicting such operators for failure to pay rent while the facility is occupied may be a difficult and slow process and may not be successful 

we may be required to impair the carrying values of the straightline rents receivable or lease intangibles or impair the related carrying value of leased properties 

many of our operating leases also contain noncontingent rent escalators for which we recognize income on a straightline basis over the lease term this method results in rental income in the early years of a lease being higher than actual cash received creating a straightline rent receivable asset included in the caption other assets net on our consolidated balance sheets at some point during 

the lease depending on its terms the cash rent payments eventually exceed the straightline rent which results in the straightline rent receivable asset decreasing to zero over the remainder of the lease term we assess the collectability of the straightline rent that is expected to be collected in a future period and depending on circumstances we may provide a reserve against the previously recognized straightline rent receivable asset for a portion up to its full value that we estimate may not be recoverable in addition upon acquisition of a leased property that we account for as an operating lease we may record leaserelated intangible assets the balance of straightline rent receivable at december 31 2010 net of allowances was 207 million we had approximately 316 million of leaserelated intangible assets net of amortization and 148 million of leaserelated intangible liabilities net of amortization associated with our operating leases at december 31 2010 to the extent any of the operators or tenants for our properties for the reasons discussed above become unable to pay amounts due we may be required to impair the carrying values of the straightline rents receivable or lease intangibles or may impair the related carrying value of leased properties 

the current us housing market may adversely affect our operators and tenants ability to increase or maintain occupancy levels at and rental income from our senior housing facilities 

our tenants and operators may have relatively flat or declining occupancy levels in the nearterm due to falling home prices declining incomes stagnant home sales and other economic factors seniors may choose to postpone their plans to move into senior housing facilities rather than sell their homes at a loss or for a profit below their expectations moreover tightening lending standards have made it more difficult for potential buyers to obtain mortgage financing all of which have contributed to the declining home sales in addition the senior housing segment may continue to experience a decline in occupancy associated with private pay residents choosing to move out of the facilities to be cared for at home by relatives due to the weak economy a material decline in our tenants and operators occupancy levels and revenues may make it more difficult for them to meet their financial obligations to us which could materially adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

operators and tenants that fail to comply with the requirements of governmental reimbursement programs such as medicare or medicaid may cease to operate or be unable to meet their financial and other contractual obligations to us 

certain of our operators and tenants are affected by an extremely complex set of federal state and local laws and regulations that are subject to frequent and substantial changes sometimes applied retroactively resulting from legislation adoption of rules and regulations and administrative and judicial interpretations of existing law see item 1—business—government regulation licensing and enforcement above for example to the extent that any of our operators or tenants receive a significant portion of their revenues from governmental payors primarily medicare and medicaid such revenues may be subject to 

• statutory and regulatory changes • retroactive rate adjustments • recovery of program overpayments or setoffs • administrative rulings • policy interpretations • payment or other delays by fiscal intermediaries or carriers • government funding restrictions at a program level or with respect to specific facilities and • interruption or delays in payments due to any ongoing governmental investigations and audits at such property 21 

in recent years governmental payors have frozen or reduced payments to healthcare providers due to budgetary pressures healthcare reimbursement will likely continue to be of significant importance to federal and state authorities we cannot make any assessment as to the ultimate timing or the effect that any future legislative reforms may have on our operators and tenants costs of doing business and on the amount of reimbursement by government and other thirdparty payors the failure of any of our operators or tenants to comply with these laws requirements and regulations could materially adversely affect their ability to meet their financial and contractual obligations to us 

operators and tenants that fail to comply with federal state and local licensure certification and inspection laws and regulations may cease to operate or be unable to meet their financial and other contractual obligations to us 

certain of our operators and tenants are subject to extensive federal state and local licensure certification and inspection laws and regulations our operators or tenants failure to comply with any of these laws could result in loss of accreditation denial of reimbursement imposition of fines suspension or decertification from federal and state healthcare programs loss of license or closure of the facility for example certain of our properties may require a license andor certificate of need to operate failure of any operator or tenant to obtain a license or certificate of need or loss of a required license or certificate of need would prevent a facility from operating in the manner intended by such operator or tenant additionally failure of our operators and tenants to generally comply with applicable laws and regulations may have an adverse effect on facilities owned by or mortgaged to us and therefore may materially adversely impact us see item 1—business—government regulation licensing and enforcement—healthcare licensure and certificate of need above 

the impact of the comprehensive healthcare regulation enacted in 2010 on us and operators and tenants cannot accurately be predicted 

legislative proposals are introduced or proposed in congress and in some state legislatures each year that would affect major changes in the healthcare system either nationally or at the state level while congress passed comprehensive legislation last year that provides for significant changes to the us healthcare system over the next ten years congress is currently considering making changes to that new legislation in addition the comprehensive health care legislation passed by congress in 2010 provides for extensive future rulemaking by regulatory authorities we cannot accurately predict whether any pending legislative proposals will be adopted or if adopted what effect if any these proposals would have on our operators and tenants and thus our business similarly while we can anticipate that some of the rulemaking that will be promulgated by regulatory authorities will affect our operators and tenants and the manner in which they are reimbursed by the federal health care programs we cannot accurately predict today the impact of those regulations on our operators and tenants and thus on our business 

increased competition as well as an inability to grow revenues as originally forecast have resulted in lower net revenues for some of our operators and tenants and may affect their ability to meet their financial and other contractual obligations to us 

the healthcare industry is highly competitive and can become more competitive in the future the occupancy levels at and rental income from our facilities is dependent on our ability and the ability of our operators and tenants to maintain and increase such levels and income and to compete with entities that have substantial capital resources these entities compete with other operators and tenants on a number of different levels including the quality of care provided reputation the physical appearance of a facility price the range of services offered family preference alternatives for healthcare delivery the supply of competing properties physicians staff referral sources location and the size and demographics of the population in the surrounding area private federal and state 

payment programs and the effect of laws and regulations may also have a significant influence on the profitability of the properties and their tenants our operators and tenants also compete with numerous other companies providing similar healthcare services or alternatives such as home health agencies life care at home communitybased service programs retirement communities and convalescent centers such competition which has intensified due to overbuilding in some segments in which we invest has caused the occupancy rate of newly constructed buildings to slow and the monthly rate that many newly built and previously existing facilities were able to obtain for their services to decrease we cannot be certain that the operators and tenants of all of our facilities will be able to achieve occupancy and rate levels that will enable them to meet all of their obligations to us further many competing companies may have resources and attributes that are superior to those of our operators and tenants thus our operators and tenants may encounter increased competition in the future that could limit their ability to maintain or attract residents or expand their businesses which could materially adversely affect their ability to meet their financial and other contractual obligation to us potentially decreasing our revenues and increasing our collection and dispute costs 

our operators and tenants may not procure the necessary insurance to adequately insure against losses 

our leases generally require our tenants and operators to secure and maintain comprehensive liability and property insurance that covers us as well as the tenants and operators some types of losses may not be adequately insured by our tenants and operators should an uninsured loss or a loss in excess of insured limits occur we could incur liability or lose all or a portion of the capital we have invested in a property as well as the anticipated future revenues from the property in such an event we might nevertheless remain obligated for any mortgage debt or other financial obligations related to the property we continually review the insurance maintained by our tenants and operators however we cannot assure you that material uninsured losses or losses in excess of insurance proceeds will not occur in the future 

our operators and tenants are faced with litigation and may experience rising liability and insurance costs 

in some states advocacy groups have been created to monitor the quality of care at healthcare facilities and these groups have brought litigation against the operators and tenants of such facilities also in several instances private litigation by patients has succeeded in winning large damage awards for alleged abuses the effect of this litigation and other potential litigation may materially increase the costs incurred by our operators and tenants for monitoring and reporting quality of care compliance in addition their cost of liability and medical malpractice insurance can be significant and may increase so long as the present healthcare litigation environment continues cost increases could cause our operators to be unable to make their lease or mortgage payments or fail to purchase the appropriate liability and malpractice insurance potentially decreasing our revenues and increasing our collection and litigation costs in addition as a result of our ownership of healthcare facilities we may be named as a defendant in lawsuits allegedly arising from the actions of our operators or tenants which may require unanticipated expenditures on our part 

our tenants in the life science industry face high levels of regulation expense and uncertainty 

life science tenants particularly those involved in developing and marketing pharmaceutical products are subject to certain unique risks as follows 

• some of our tenants require significant outlays of funds for the research development and clinical testing of their products and technologies if private investors the government or other sources of funding are unavailable to support such activities a tenants business may be adversely affected or fail 23 

• the research development clinical testing manufacture and marketing of some of our tenants products require federal state and foreign regulatory approvals which may be costly or difficult to obtain • even after a life science tenant gains regulatory approval and market acceptance the product may still present significant regulatory and liability risks including among others the possible later discovery of safety concerns competition from new products and ultimately the expiration of patent protection for the product • our tenants with marketable products may be adversely affected by healthcare reform and the reimbursement policies of government or private healthcare payors and • our tenants may be unable to adequately protect their intellectual property under patent copyright or trade secret laws we cannot assure you that our life science tenants will be successful in their businesses if our tenants businesses are adversely affected they may have difficulty making payments to us which could materially adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

tax and reitrelated risks 

loss of our tax status as a reit would substantially reduce our available funds and would have material adverse consequences to us and the value of our common stock 

qualification as a reit involves the application of numerous highly technical and complex provisions of the internal revenue code of 1986 as amended the code for which there are only limited judicial and administrative interpretations as well as the determination of various factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control we intend to continue to operate in a manner that enables us to qualify as a reit however our qualification and taxation as a reit depend upon our ability to meet through actual annual operating results asset diversification distribution levels and diversity of stock ownership the various qualification tests imposed under the code for example to qualify as a reit at least 95 of our gross income in any year must be derived from qualifying sources and we must make distributions to our stockholders aggregating annually at least 90 of our reit taxable income excluding net capital gains in addition new legislation regulations administrative interpretations or court decisions could change the tax laws or interpretations of the tax laws regarding qualification as a reit or the federal income tax consequences of that qualification in a manner that is materially adverse to our stockholders accordingly there is no assurance that we have operated or will continue to operate in a manner so as to qualify or remain qualified as a reit 

if we lose our reit status we will face serious tax consequences that will substantially reduce the funds available to make payments of principal and interest on the debt securities we issue and to make distributions to stockholders if we fail to qualify as a reit 

• we will not be allowed a deduction for distributions to stockholders in computing our taxable income • we will be subject to corporatelevel income tax including any applicable alternative minimum tax on our taxable income at regular corporate rates • we could be subject to increased local income taxes and • unless we are entitled to relief under relevant statutory provisions we will be disqualified from taxation as a reit for the four taxable years following the year during which we fail to qualify as a reit 24 

as a result of all these factors our failure to qualify as a reit also could impair our ability to expand our business and raise capital and could materially adversely affect the value of our common stock 

certain property transfers may generate prohibited transaction income resulting in a penalty tax on gain attributable to the transaction 

from time to time we may transfer or otherwise dispose of some of our properties under the code any gain resulting from transfers of properties that we hold as inventory or primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business would be treated as income from a prohibited transaction subject to a 100 penalty tax since we acquire properties for investment purposes we do not believe that our occasional transfers of property are properly treated as prohibited transactions however the determination that a transfer constitutes a prohibited transaction is based on the facts and circumstances surrounding each transfer the internal revenue service irs may contend that certain transfers of properties by us are prohibited transactions while we believe that the irs would not prevail in any such dispute if the irs were to argue successfully that a transfer of property constituted a prohibited transaction then we would be required to pay a 100 penalty tax on any gain from the prohibited transaction in addition income from a prohibited transaction might materially adversely affect our ability to satisfy the income tests for qualification as a reit for federal income tax purposes 

we could in the future choose to pay dividends in our own stock in which case you may be required to pay tax in excess of the cash you receive 

under certain circumstances a stock dividend will be a taxable dividend if each stockholder can elect to receive the distribution in cash even if the aggregate cash amount paid to all stockholders is limited accordingly if we decide to pay a stock dividend in such a manner your taxable dividend will include the amount of stock and your tax liability with respect to such dividend may be significantly greater than the amount of cash you receive 

we could have potential deferred and contingent tax liabilities from corporate acquisitions that could limit delay or impede future sales of our properties 

if during the tenyear period beginning on the date we acquire certain companies we recognize gain on the disposition of any property acquired then to the extent of the excess of i the fair market value of such property as of the acquisition date over ii our adjusted income tax basis in such property as of that date we will be required to pay a corporatelevel federal income tax on this gain at the highest regular corporate rate there can be no assurance that these triggering dispositions will not occur and these requirements could limit delay or impede future sales of our properties 

in addition the irs may assert liabilities against us for corporate income taxes for taxable years prior to the time that we acquire certain companies in which case we will owe these taxes plus interest and penalties if any 

there are uncertainties relating to the calculation of nonreit tax earnings and profits ep in certain acquisitions which may require us to distribute ep 

in order to remain qualified as a reit we are required to distribute to our stockholders all of the accumulated nonreit ep of certain companies that we acquire prior to the close of the first taxable year in which the acquisition occurs failure to make such ep distributions would result in our disqualification as a reit the determination of the amount to be distributed in such ep distributions is a complex factual and legal determination we may have less than complete information at the time we undertake our analysis or we may interpret the applicable law differently from the irs 

we currently believe that we have satisfied the requirements relating to such ep distributions there are however substantial uncertainties relating to the determination of ep including the possibility that the irs could successfully assert that the taxable income of the companies acquired should be increased which would increase our nonreit ep moreover an audit of the acquired company following our acquisition could result in an increase in accumulated nonreit ep which could require us to pay an additional taxable distribution to our thenexisting stockholders if we qualify under rules for curing this type of default or could result in our disqualification as a reit 

thus we might fail to satisfy the requirement that we distribute all of our nonreit ep by the close of the first taxable year in which the acquisition occurs moreover although there are procedures available to cure a failure to distribute all of our ep we cannot now determine whether we will be able to take advantage of these procedures or the economic impact on us of doing so 

risks related to our legal organizational structure 

our charter contains ownership limits with respect to our common stock and other classes of capital stock 

our charter contains restrictions on the ownership and transfer of our common stock and preferred stock that are intended to assist us in preserving our qualification as a reit under our charter subject to certain exceptions no person or entity may own actually or constructively more than 98 by value or by number of shares whichever is more restrictive of the outstanding shares of our common stock or any class or series of our preferred stock 

additionally our charter has a 99 ownership limitation on the direct or indirect ownership of our voting shares which may include common stock or other classes of capital stock our board of directors in its sole discretion may exempt a proposed transferee from either ownership limit the ownership limits may delay defer or prevent a transaction or a change of control that might involve a premium price for our common stock or might otherwise be in the best interests of our stockholders 

we are subject to certain provisions of maryland law and our charter relating to business combinations 

the maryland business combination act provides that unless exempted a maryland corporation may not engage in business combinations including a merger consolidation share exchange or in circumstances specified in the statute an asset transfer or issuance or reclassification of equity securities with an interested stockholder or an affiliate of an interested stockholder for five years after the most recent date no which the interested stockholder became an interested stockholder and thereafter unless specified criteria are met an interested stockholder is generally a person owning or controlling directly or indirectly 10 or more of the voting power of the outstanding voting stock of a maryland corporation unless our board of directors takes action to exempt us generally or with respect to certain transactions from this statute in the future the maryland business combination act will be applicable to business combinations between us and other persons 

in addition to the restrictions on business combinations contained in the maryland business combination act our charter also contains restrictions on business combinations our charter requires that except in certain circumstances business combinations including a merger or consolidation and certain asset transfers and issuances of securities with a related person including a beneficial owner of 10 or more of our outstanding voting stock be approved by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 90 of our outstanding voting stock 

the restrictions on business combinations provided under maryland law and contained in our charter may delay defer or prevent a change of control or other transaction even if such transaction involves a premium price for our common stock or our stockholders believe that such transaction is otherwise in their best interests

a changes in national and local economic conditions including a prolonged period of weak economic growth b continued volatility in the capital markets including changes in interest rates and the availability and cost of capital c the ability of the company to manage its indebtedness level and changes in the terms of such indebtedness d changes in federal state or local laws and regulations including those affecting the healthcare industry that affect our costs of compliance or increase the costs or otherwise affect the operations of our operators tenants and borrowers e the potential impact of existing and future litigation matters including the possibility of larger than expected litigation costs and related developments f competition for tenants and borrowers including with respect to new leases and mortgages and the renewal or rollover of existing leases g the ability of the company to negotiate the same or better terms with new tenants or operators if existing leases are not renewed or the company exercises its right to replace an existing operator or tenant upon default h availability of suitable properties to acquire at favorable prices and the competition for the acquisition and financing of those properties i the ability of our operators tenants and borrowers to conduct their respective businesses in a manner sufficient to maintain or increase their revenues and to generate sufficient income to make rent and loan payments to us j the financial weakness of some operators and tenants including potential bankruptcies and downturns in their businesses which results in uncertainties regarding our ability to continue to realize the full benefit of such operators andor tenants leases 36 

k the financial legal and regulatory difficulties of significant operators of our properties including sunrise l the risk that we may not be able to achieve the benefits of investments within expected timeframes or at all or within expected cost projections m the ability to obtain financing necessary to consummate acquisitions on favorable terms and n changes in the reimbursement available to our tenants and borrowers by governmental or private payors including changes in medicare and medicaid payment levels and the availability and cost of third party insurance coverage except as required by law we undertake no and hereby disclaim any obligation to update any forwardlooking statements whether as a result of new information changed circumstances or otherwise 

the information set forth in this item 7 is intended to provide readers with an understanding of our financial condition changes in financial condition and results of operations we will discuss and provide our analysis in the following order 

• executive summary • 2010 transaction overview • dividends • critical accounting policies • results of operations • liquidity and capital resources • nongaap financial measure—funds from operations • offbalance sheet arrangements • contractual obligations • inflation • recent accounting pronouncements executive summary 

we are a selfadministered reit that together with our unconsolidated joint ventures invests primarily in real estate serving the healthcare industry in the us we acquire develop lease manage and dispose of healthcare real estate and provide financing to healthcare providers at december 31 2010 our portfolio of investments including properties owned by our investment management platform consisted of interests in 672 facilities and 20 billion of mezzanine and other secured loan investments 

our business strategy is based on three principles i opportunistic investing ii portfolio diversification and iii conservative financing we actively redeploy capital from investments with lower return potential into assets with higher return potential we make investments where the expected riskadjusted return exceeds our cost of capital and strive to capitalize on our operator tenant and other business relationships 

our strategy contemplates acquiring and developing properties on terms that are favorable to us generally we prefer larger more complex private transactions that leverage our management teams experience and our infrastructure 

we follow a disciplined approach to enhancing the value of our existing portfolio including ongoing evaluation of potential disposition of properties that no longer fit our strategy during the year ended december 31 2010 we sold real estate and debt investments for 230 million resulting in gains of 33 million 

we primarily generate revenue by leasing healthcare properties under longterm leases most of our rents and other earned income from leases are received under triplenet leases or leases that provide for substantial recovery of operating expenses however some of our medical office and life science leases are structured as gross or modified gross leases accordingly for such mobs and life science facilities we incur certain property operating expenses such as real estate taxes repairs and maintenance property management fees utilities and insurance our growth for these assets depends in part on our ability to i increase rental income and other earned income from leases by increasing rental rates and occupancy levels ii maximize tenant recoveries given underlying lease structures and iii control operating and other expenses our operations are impacted by property specific market specific general economic and other conditions 

access to capital markets impacts our cost of capital and ability to refinance maturing indebtedness as well as to fund future acquisitions and development through the issuance of additional securities or secured debt access to external capital on favorable terms is critical to the success of our strategy

critical accounting policies 

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap requires our management to use judgment in the application of accounting policies including making estimates and assumptions we base estimates on our experience and on various other assumptions believed to be reasonable under the circumstances these estimates affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods if our judgment or interpretation of the facts and circumstances relating to various transactions or other matters had been different it is possible that different accounting would have been applied resulting in a different presentation of our consolidated financial statements from time to time we reevaluate our estimates and assumptions in the event estimates or assumptions prove to be different from actual results adjustments are made in subsequent periods to reflect more current estimates and assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain for a more detailed discussion of our significant accounting policies see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements below is a discussion of accounting policies that we consider critical in that they may require complex judgment in their application or require estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain 

principles of consolidation 

the consolidated financial statements include the accounts of hcp inc our wholly owned subsidiaries and joint ventures that we control through voting rights or other means we consolidate investments in variable interest entities vies when we are the primary beneficiary of the vie at i the inception of the variable interest entity ii as a result of a change in circumstance identified during our continuous review of our vie relationships or iii upon the occurrence of a qualifying reconsideration event 

we make judgments with respect to our level of influence or control of an entity and whether we are or are not the primary beneficiary of a vie consideration of various factors includes but is not limited to our ability to direct the activities that most significantly impact the entitys economic performance our form of ownership interest our representation on the entitys governing body the size and seniority of our investment our ability and the rights of other investors to participate in policy making decisions replace the manager andor liquidate the entity if applicable our ability to correctly assess our influence or control over an entity at inception of our involvement or on a continuous basis when determining the primary beneficiary of a vie affects the presentation of these entities in our 

consolidated financial statements if we perform a primary beneficiary analysis at a date other than at inception of the variable interest entity our assumptions may be different and may result in the identification of a different primary beneficiary 

if we determine that we are the primary beneficiary of a vie our consolidated financial statements would include the operating results of the vie either tenant or borrower rather than the results of the variable interest in the vie we would depend on the vie to provide us timely financial information and rely on the internal control of the vie to provide accurate financial information if the vie has deficiencies in its internal control over financial reporting or does not provide us with timely financial information this may adversely impact our financial reporting and our internal control over financial reporting 

revenue recognition 

we recognize rental revenue on a straightline basis over the lease term when collectibility is reasonably assured and the tenant has taken possession or controls the physical use of the leased asset for assets acquired subject to leases we recognize revenue upon acquisition of the asset provided the tenant has taken possession or controls the physical use of the leased asset if the lease provides for tenant improvements we determine whether the tenant improvements for accounting purposes are owned by the tenant or us when we are the owner of the tenant improvements the tenant is not considered to have taken physical possession or have control of the physical use of the leased asset until the tenant improvements are substantially completed when the tenant is the owner of the tenant improvements any tenant improvement allowance funded is treated as a lease incentive and amortized as a reduction of revenue over the lease term the determination of ownership of the tenant improvements is subject to significant judgment if our assessment of the owner of the tenant improvements for accounting purposes were to change the timing and amount of our revenue recognized would be impacted 

certain leases provide for additional rents contingent upon a percentage of the facilitys revenue in excess of specified base amounts or other thresholds such revenue is recognized when actual results reported by the tenant or estimates of tenant results exceed the base amount or other thresholds the recognition of additional rents requires us to make estimates of amounts owed and to a certain extent are dependent on the accuracy of the facility results reported to us our estimates may differ from actual results which could be material to our consolidated financial statements 

we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts including an allowance for straightline rent receivables for estimated losses resulting from tenant defaults or the inability of tenants to make contractual rent and tenant recovery payments we monitor the liquidity and creditworthiness of our tenants and operators on an ongoing basis this evaluation considers industry and economic conditions property performance credit enhancements and other factors for straightline rent amounts our assessment is based on income recoverable over the term of the lease we exercise judgment in establishing allowances and consider payment history and current credit status in developing these estimates these estimates may differ from actual results which could be material to our consolidated financial statements 

loans receivable are classified as heldforinvestment based on managements intent and ability to hold the loans for the foreseeable future or to maturity we recognize interest income on loans including the amortization of discounts and premiums using the effective interest method applied on a loanbyloan basis when collectibility of the future payments is reasonably assured premiums discounts and related costs are recognized as yield adjustments over the life of the related loans 

we use the direct finance method of accounting to record income from dfls for leases accounted for as dfls future minimum lease payments are recorded as a receivable the difference between the future minimum lease payments and the estimated residual values less the cost of the 

properties is recorded as unearned income unearned income is deferred and amortized to income over the lease terms to provide a constant yield when collectibility of the lease payments is reasonably assured investments in dfls are presented net of unamortized unearned income 

loans and dfls are placed on nonaccrual status at such time as management determines that collectibility of contractual amounts is not reasonably assured while on nonaccrual status loans or dfls are either accounted for on a cash basis in which income is recognized only upon receipt of cash or on a costrecovery basis in which all cash receipts reduce the carrying value of the loan or dfl based on managements judgment of collectibility 

allowances are established for loans and dfls based upon a probable loss estimate for individual loans and dfls deemed to be impaired loans and dfls are impaired when it is deemed probable that we will be unable to collect all amounts due on a timely basis in accordance with the contractual terms of the loan or lease determining the adequacy of the allowance is complex and requires significant judgment by us about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain the allowance is based upon our assessment of the borrowers or lessees overall financial condition resources and payment record the prospects for support from any financially responsible guarantors and if appropriate the realizable value of any collateral these estimates consider all available evidence including as appropriate the present value of the expected future cash flows discounted at the loans or dfls effective interest rate the fair value of collateral general economic conditions and trends historical and industry loss experience and other relevant factors while our assumptions are based in part upon historical data our estimates may differ from actual results which could be material to our consolidated financial statements 

real estate 

we make estimates as part of our allocation of the purchase price of acquisitions to the various components of the acquisition based upon the relative fair value of each component the most significant components of our allocations are typically the allocation of fair value to the buildings asifvacant land and inplace leases in the case of the fair value of buildings and the allocation of value to land and other intangibles our estimates of the values of these components will affect the amount of depreciation and amortization we record over the estimated useful life of the property acquired or the remaining lease term in the case of the value of inplace leases we make our best estimates based on our evaluation of the specific characteristics of each tenants lease factors considered include estimates of carrying costs during hypothetical expected leaseup periods market conditions and costs to execute similar leases our assumptions affect the amount of future revenue that we will recognize over the remaining lease term for the acquired inplace leases 

a variety of costs are incurred in the acquisition development and leasing of properties after determination is made to capitalize a cost it is allocated to the specific component of a project that is benefited determination of when a development project is substantially complete and capitalization must cease involves a degree of judgment the costs of land and buildings under development include specifically identifiable costs the capitalized costs include preconstruction costs essential to the development of the property development costs construction costs interest costs real estate taxes and other costs incurred during the period of development we consider a construction project as substantially completed and held available for occupancy and cease capitalization of costs upon the completion of the related tenant improvements 

impairment of longlived assets and goodwill 

we assess the carrying value of our real estate assets and related intangibles real estate assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable recoverability of real estate assets is measured by comparison of the 

carrying amount of the asset to the estimated future undiscounted cash flows in order to review our real estate assets for recoverability we consider market conditions as well as our intent with respect to holding or disposing of the asset fair value is determined through various valuation techniques including discounted cash flow models quoted market values and third party appraisals where considered necessary if our analysis indicates that the carrying value of the real estate asset is not recoverable on an undiscounted cash flow basis we recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the real estate asset 

goodwill is tested for impairment at least annually by applying the twostep approach if the fair value of a reporting unit containing goodwill is less than its carrying value then a second step of the test is needed to measure the amount of potential goodwill impairment the second step requires the fair value of a reporting unit to be allocated to all the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination at the date of the impairment test the excess of the fair value of the reporting unit over the fair value of assets and liabilities is the implied value of goodwill and is used to determine the amount of impairment we estimate the current fair value of the assets and liabilities in the reporting unit through various valuation techniques including applying capitalization rates to estimated segment net operating income quoted market values and thirdparty appraisals as necessary the fair value of the reporting unit may also include an allocation of an enterprise value premium that we estimate a third party would be willing to pay for the company 

the determination of the fair value of real estate assets and goodwill involves significant judgment this judgment is based on our analysis and estimates of fair value of real estate assets and reporting units and the future operating results and resulting cash flows of each real estate asset whose carrying amount may not be recoverable our ability to accurately predict future operating results and cash flows and estimate and allocate fair values impacts the timing and recognition of impairments while we believe our assumptions are reasonable changes in these assumptions may have a material impact on our financial results 

investments in unconsolidated joint ventures 

investments in entities which we do not consolidate but have the ability to exercise significant influence over operating and financial policies are reported under the equity method of accounting under the equity method of accounting our share of the investees earnings or losses are included in our consolidated results of operations 

the initial carrying value of investments in unconsolidated joint ventures is based on the amount paid to purchase the joint venture interest or the carrying value of the assets prior to the sale of interests in the joint venture we evaluate our equity method investments for impairment based upon a comparison of the fair value of the equity method investment to our carrying value when we determine a decline in the fair value of our investment in an unconsolidated joint venture is below its carrying value is otherthantemporary an impairment is recorded the determination of the fair value of investments in unconsolidated joint ventures involves significant judgment our estimates consider all available evidence including as appropriate the present value of the expected future cash flows discounted at market rates general economic conditions and trends and other relevant factors capitalization rates discount rates and credit spreads utilized in our valuation models are based upon rates that we believe to be within a reasonable range of current market rates for the respective investments while we believe our assumptions are reasonable changes in these assumptions may have a material impact on our financial results 

income taxes 

as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements significant management judgment is required to evaluate our compliance with reit requirements our determinations are 

based on interpretation of tax laws and our conclusions may have an impact on the income tax expense recognized adjustments to income tax expense may be required as a result of i audits conducted by federal and state tax authorities ii our ability to qualify as a reit iii the potential for builtingain recognized related to priortaxfree acquisitions of c corporations and iv changes in tax laws adjustments required in any given period are included in income other than adjustments to income tax liabilities acquired in business combinations which are adjusted through goodwill 

results of operations 

we evaluate our business and allocate resources among our five business segments i senior housing ii life science iii medical office iv postacuteskilled nursing and v hospital under the senior housing life science postacuteskilled nursing and hospital segments we invest primarily in single operator or tenant properties through the acquisition and development of real estate and by debt issued by operators in these sectors under the medical office segment we invest through the acquisition of mobs that are primarily leased under gross or modified gross leases generally to multiple tenants and which generally require a greater level of property management the accounting policies of the segments are the same as those described in the summary of significant accounting policies see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements 

subject to closing the hcr manorcare acquisition anticipated in march 2011 we expect to account for the leases of the 334 hcr manorcare postacute skilled nursing and assisted living facilities as dfls as a result we expect significant increases in our income from dfls further a portion of the consideration for the hcr manorcare acquisition will be provided by the reinvestment of our existing 172 billion par value debt investments in hcr manorcare which will result in a significant reduction of interest income in 2011 

on january 14 2011 we acquired our partners 65 interest in hcp ventures ii becoming the sole owner of the portfolio during 2011 we expect increases in rental and related revenues and decreases in investment management fee income as a result of acquiring our partners interest in hcp ventures ii 

on january 24 2011 we issued 24 billion of senior unsecured notes with a combined weighted average yield of 483 as a result of the issuance of these senior unsecured notes we expect a significant increase in interest expense for 2011

operating expenses 



operating expenses are predominantly related to mob and life science properties where we incur the expenses and recover all or a portion of those expenses under the respective leases accordingly the number of properties in our mob and life science portfolios directly impact operating expenses the presentation of expenses as general and administrative or operating is based on the underlying nature of the expense periodically we review the classification of expenses between categories and make revisions that we believe improve the quality of our presentation 

• senior housing senior housing operating expenses decreased primarily as a result of a decrease in facilitylevel operating expenses for three senior housing properties that were previously under management agreements and released on a triplenet basis during 2009 • life science life science operating expenses increased primarily as a result of an increase in occupancy levels at our life science facilities and the impact of development assets placed in service during 2008 • medical office medical office operating expenses decreased primarily as a result of cost saving initiatives implemented in 2009 and the impact of properties which were taken out of service and placed into redevelopment during 2008 and 2009 50 

general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses increased 48 million to 785 million for the year ended december 31 2009 the increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily due to an increase in legal fees associated with litigation matters partially offset by lower compensation related expenses for the year ended december 31 2009 and 2008 in relation to the ventas litigation matter we incurred legal expenses of 132 million and 69 million respectively see the information set forth under the heading legal proceedings of note 12 to the consolidated financial statements 

litigation provision on september 4 2009 a jury returned a verdict in favor of ventas in an action brought against us in the united states district court for the western district of kentucky for tortious interference with prospective business advantage in connection with ventas 2007 acquisition of sunrise reit the jury awarded ventas approximately 102 million in compensatory damages which we recorded as a litigation provision expense during 2009 see the information set forth under the heading legal proceedings of note 12 to the consolidated financial statements 

impairments recoveries during the year ended december 31 2009 we recognized impairments of 755 million as a result of i an aggregate 631 million provision related to dfl and loan losses impairment charges related to the bankruptcy of erickson who was the tenant at three of our senior housing ccrc dfls and the borrower of a senior construction loan in which we had a 10 million participation see note 6 to the consolidated financial statements and ii 59 million of intangible assets on 12 of 15 senior housing communities that were written off due to the termination of the sunrise management agreements on 15 senior housing communities effective october 1 2009 iii 43 million related to a senior secured term loan as a result of an expected restructuring of terms to the loan following the default of the borrower in our hospital segment see note 7 to the consolidated financial statements and iv 22 million related to intangible assets associated with the early termination of a lease in our life science segment 

during the year ended december 31 2008 we recognized impairments of 275 million as follows i 120 million related to intangible assets associated with the transfer of an 11property senior housing portfolio ii 37 million related to intangible assets associated with the early termination of three leases in the life science segment iii 10 million related to intangible assets associated with the early termination of two leases in the hospital segment iv 16 million related to two senior housing facilities as a result of a decrease in expected cash flows and v 92 million included in discontinued operations related to the decrease in expected cash flows and anticipated dispositions of two senior housing properties and one hospital 

other income net for the year ended december 31 2009 other income net decreased 179 million to 78 million this decrease was primarily related to the 286 million of income related to the 2008 settlement of litigation with tenet and a 24 million gain on the early repayment of debt the decrease was partially offset by increases in gains on marketable debt securities of 86 million and a reduction of 73 million of otherthantemporary impairments on marketable equity securities for a more detailed description of our marketable securities investments see note 10 of the consolidated financial statements 

income taxes for the year ended december 31 2009 income taxes decreased 23 million to 19 million this decrease is primarily due to i lower interest earned due to a decline in libor for a portion of one of our mezzanine loans ii the transfer of a loan investment out of one of our trs and iii increased depreciation expense due to a correction of an immaterial error for one of our real estate investments held in a trs 

discontinued operations income from discontinued operations for the year ended december 31 2009 was 45 million compared to 2465 million for the comparable period in 2008 the decrease is primarily due to a decrease in gains on real estate dispositions of 1919 million and a decline in 

operating income from discontinued operations of 187 million partially offset by a reduction of impairment charges in discontinued operations of 91 million during the year ended december 31 2009 we sold 14 properties for 72 million as compared to 51 properties for 643 million for the year ended december 31 2008 

noncontrolling interests share in earnings for the year ended december 31 2009 noncontrolling interests share in earnings decreased 80 million to 145 million this decrease was primarily due to i a 4 million decrease related to the conversions of 33 million downreit units that converted into shares of our common stock during 2008 and 2009 and ii a 4 million decrease related to purchases of other noncontrolling interests during 2008 and 2009 

liquidity and capital resources 

our principal liquidity needs are to i fund recurring operating expenses ii meet debt service requirements including 292 million of senior unsecured notes and 58 million of mortgage debt principal payments and maturities in 2011 iii fund capital expenditures including tenant improvements and leasing costs iv fund acquisition and development activities and v make dividend distributions we believe these needs will be satisfied using cash flows generated by operations and from our various financing activities during the next twelve months during the year ended december 31 2010 distributions to shareholders and noncontrolling interest holders exceeded cash flows from operations by approximately 26 million during 2010 we raised aggregate net proceeds of 26 billion from issuances of common stock and sales of marketable securities and real estate which proceeds among other things were the sources of cash used to fund the excess of distributions to shareholders and noncontrolling interest holders above cash flows from operations during the year ended december 31 2010 

we intend to pay the 353 billion cash portion of the consideration for the hcr manorcare acquisition primarily with the proceeds from our 1472 billion december 2010 common stock offering and 24 billion january 2011 senior unsecured note offering 

access to capital markets impacts our cost of capital and ability to refinance maturing indebtedness as well as our ability to fund future acquisitions and development through the issuance of additional securities or secured debt credit ratings impact our ability to access capital and directly impact our cost of capital as well for example as noted below our revolving line of credit facility accrues interest at a rate per annum equal to libor plus a margin that depends upon our debt ratings we also pay a facility fee on the entire revolving commitment that depends upon our debt ratings as of january 31 2011 we had a credit rating of baa2 stable from moodys bbb stable from sp and bbb watch positive from fitch on our senior unsecured debt securities and baa3 stable from moodys bb stable from sp and bb watch positive from fitch on our preferred equity securities 

net cash provided by operating activities was 580 million and 516 million for the years ended december 31 2010 and 2009 respectively the increase in operating cash flows is primarily the result of the following i the additive impact of our investments in 2009 and 2010 ii assets placed in service in 2010 and iii rent escalations and resets in 2009 and 2010 our cash flows from operations are dependent upon the occupancy level of multitenant buildings rental rates on leases our tenants performance on their lease obligations the level of operating expenses and other factors 

net cash used by investing activities was 431 million for the year ended december 31 2010 and consisted of the net effects of funding i 305 million for acquisition and development of real estate ii 298 million for investments in loans receivables and dfls and iii 98 million for leasing costs and tenant and capital improvements these expenditures were partially offset by our proceeds of 179 million from the sales of marketable debt securities and 32 million from the repayment of loans receivable and dfls 

net cash provided by financing activities was 775 million for the year ended december 31 2010 and consisted primarily of net proceeds of 24 billion from the issuances of common stock the amount of cash provided by financing activities was partially offset by or used for the i repayment of our mortgage and other secured debt of 636 million ii payments of common and preferred dividends aggregating 591 million iii repayment of 206 million of senior unsecured notes and iv repayment of our term loan of 200 million 

debt 

bank line of credit our revolving line of credit facility with a syndicate of banks provides for an aggregate borrowing capacity of 15 billion and matures on august 1 2011 this revolving line of credit facility accrues interest at a rate per annum equal to libor plus a margin that depends upon our debt ratings we pay a facility fee on the entire revolving commitment that depends upon our debt ratings based on our debt ratings at december 31 2010 the margin on the revolving line of credit facility was 055 and the facility fee was 015 at december 31 2010 we had no amounts drawn under this revolving line of credit facility at december 31 2010 113 million of aggregate letters of credit were outstanding against our revolving line of credit facility including a 103 million letter of credit as a result of the ventas litigation for further information regarding the ventas litigation see note 12 to the consolidated financial statements 

our revolving line of credit facility contains certain financial restrictions and other customary requirements among other things these covenants using terms defined in the agreement i limit the ratio of consolidated total indebtedness to consolidated total asset value to 60 ii limit the ratio of unsecured debt to consolidated unencumbered asset value to 65 iii require a fixed charge coverage ratio of 175 times and iv require a formuladetermined minimum consolidated tangible net worth of 69 billion at december 31 2010 at december 31 2010 we were in compliance with each of these restrictions and requirements of our revolving line of credit facility 

our revolving line of credit facility also contains crossdefault provisions to other indebtedness of ours including in some instances certain mortgages on our properties certain mortgages contain default provisions relating to defaults under the leases or operating agreements on the applicable properties by our operators or tenants including default provisions relating to the bankruptcy filings of such operator or tenant although we believe that we would be able to secure amendments under the applicable agreements if a default as described above occurs such a default may result in significantly less favorable borrowing terms than currently available material delays in the availability of funding or other material adverse consequences 

senior unsecured notes at december 31 2010 we had senior unsecured notes outstanding with an aggregate principal balance of 33 billion interest rates on the notes ranged from 127 to 712 with a weighted average effective rate of 619 at december 31 2010 discounts and premiums are amortized to interest expense over the term of the related notes the senior unsecured notes contain certain covenants including limitations on debt crossacceleration provisions and other customary terms at december 31 2010 we believe we were in compliance with these covenants 

on january 24 2011 we issued 24 billion of senior unsecured notes as follows i 400 million of 270 notes due 2014 ii 500 million of 375 notes due 2016 iii 12 billion of 5375 notes due 2021 and iv 300 million of 675 notes due 2041 the notes have a weighted average maturity of 103 years and a weighted average yield of 483 the net proceeds of the offering were 237 billion if the hcr manorcare acquisition is not completed by june 13 2011 under certain conditions permitted under the purchase agreement this date may be extended to september 13 2011 we are required to redeem all of these senior unsecured notes at 101 of the principal amount 20 business days subsequent to the earlier of such date or the date that the purchase agreement is terminated 

mortgage and other secured debt at december 31 2010 we had 12 billion in aggregate principal amount of mortgage debt secured by 138 healthcare facilities which had a carrying amount of 20 billion interest rates on the mortgage debt ranged from 196 to 830 with a weighted average effective interest rate of 614 at december 31 2010 

mortgage debt generally requires monthly principal and interest payments is collateralized by certain properties and is generally nonrecourse mortgage debt typically restricts transfer of the encumbered properties prohibits additional liens restricts prepayment requires payment of real estate taxes requires maintenance of the properties in good condition requires maintenance of insurance on the properties and includes requirements to obtain lender consent to enter into and terminate material leases some of the mortgage debt is also crosscollateralized by multiple properties and may require tenants or operators to maintain compliance with the applicable leases or operating agreements of such properties 

other debt at december 31 2010 we had 922 million of noninterest bearing life care bonds at two of our ccrcs and noninterest bearing occupancy fee deposits at another of our senior housing facility all of which were payable to certain residents of the facilities collectively life care bonds at december 31 2010 359 million of the life care bonds were refundable to the residents upon the resident moving out or to their estate upon death and 563 million of the life care bonds were refundable after the unit is successfully remarketed to a new resident 

debt maturities

1 excludes 92 million of other debt that represents noninterest bearing life care bonds and occupancy fee deposits at three of our senior housing facilities which have no scheduled maturities derivative financial instruments we use derivative instruments to mitigate the effects of interest rate fluctuations on specific forecasted transactions as well as recognized obligations or assets we do not use derivative instruments for speculative or trading purposes 

the following table summarizes our outstanding interest rate swap contracts as of december 31 2010 dollars in thousands 



1 represents three interestrate swap contracts with an aggregate notional amount of 456 million for a more detailed description of our derivative financial instruments see note 24 of the consolidated financial statements and quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in item 7a 

equity 

at december 31 2010 we had 40 million shares of 725 series e cumulative redeemable preferred stock 78 million shares of 710 series f cumulative redeemable preferred stock and 3709 million shares of common stock outstanding at december 31 2010 equity totaled 81 billion and our equity securities had a market value of 142 billion

nongaap financial measure—funds from operations ffo 

we believe ffo applicable to common shares diluted ffo applicable to common shares ffo before the impact of impairments recoveries and litigation provision and basic and diluted ffo per common share are important supplemental measures of operating performance for a real estate investment trust because the historical cost accounting convention used for real estate assets utilizes straightline depreciation except on land such accounting presentation implies that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time since real estate values instead have historically risen and fallen with market conditions presentations of operating results for a real estate investment trust 

that uses historical cost accounting for depreciation could be less informative the term ffo was designed by the real estate investment trust industry to address this issue 

ffo is defined as net income applicable to common shares computed in accordance with gaap excluding gains or losses from real estate dispositions plus real estate depreciation and amortization with adjustments for joint ventures adjustments for joint ventures are calculated to reflect ffo on the same basis ffo does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with gaap is not necessarily indicative of cash available to fund cash needs and should not be considered an alternative to net income our computation of ffo may not be comparable to ffo reported by other real estate investment trusts that do not define the term in accordance with the current national association of real estate investment trusts nareit definition or that have a different interpretation of the current nareit definition from us in addition we present ffo before the impact of impairments recoveries mergerrelated items and litigation provision ffo as adjusted management believes ffo as adjusted is a useful alternative measurement this measure is a modification of the nareit definition of ffo and should not be used as an alternative to net income 

details of certain items that affect comparability are discussed in the financials results summary of our financial results for the year months ended december 31 2010 2009 and 2008 the following is a reconciliation from net income applicable to common shares the most direct comparable financial measure calculated and presented with gaap to ffo dollars and shares in thousands 





1 mergerrelated items for 2010 primarily include professional fees associated with our pending hcr manorcare acquisition mergerrelated items for 2008 primarily include the amortization of fees associated with our acquisition financing for seusa 2 our weighted average shares used to calculate diluted ffo as adjusted eliminate the impact of our december 2010 common stock offering which issuance increased its weighted average outstanding shares by 15 million for the year ended december 31 2010 proceeds from this offering will be used to fund a portion of the cash consideration of our pending hcr manorcare acquisition offbalance sheet arrangements 

we own interests in certain unconsolidated joint ventures as described under note 8 to the consolidated financial statements except in limited circumstances our risk of loss is limited to our investment in the joint venture and any outstanding loans receivable in addition we have certain properties which serve as collateral for debt that is owed by a previous owner of certain of our facilities as described under note 12 to the consolidated financial statements included our risk of loss for these properties is limited to the outstanding debt balance plus penalties if any we have no other material offbalance sheet arrangements that we expect would materially affect our liquidity and capital resources except those described below under contractual obligations 

contractual obligations 

the following table summarizes our material contractual payment obligations and commitments at december 31 2010 in thousands 



1 excludes 92 million of other debt that represents noninterest bearing life care bonds and occupancy fee deposits at three of our senior housing facilities which have no scheduled maturities 2 represents construction and other commitments for developments in progress 3 interest on variablerate debt is calculated using rates in effect at december 31 2010 57 

inflation 

our leases often provide for either fixed increases in base rents or indexed escalators based on the consumer price index or other measures andor additional rent based on increases in the tenants operating revenues substantially all of our mob leases require the tenant to pay a share of property operating costs such as real estate taxes insurance and utilities substantially all of our senior housing life science postacuteskilled nursing and hospital leases require the operator or tenant to pay all of the property operating costs or reimburse us for all such costs we believe that inflationary increases in expenses will be offset in part by the operator or tenant expense reimbursements and contractual rent increases described above 

recent accounting pronouncements 

see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for the impact of new accounting standards there were no accounting pronouncements that were issued but not yet adopted by us that we believe will materially impact our consolidated financial statements 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

at december 31 2010 we were exposed to market risks related to fluctuations in interest rates on approximately 13 billion of variablerate loan investments excludes 500 million of variablerate loan investments that have been hedged through interestrate swap contracts and 83 million of other investments where the payments fluctuate with changes in libor see note 7 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our loan investments our exposure to income fluctuations related to our variablerate investments is partially offset by i 31 million of variablerate mortgage notes debt payable excludes 88 million of variablerate mortgage notes that have been hedged through interestrate swap contracts ii 25 million of variablerate senior unsecured notes and iii 250 million of additional variable interestrate exposure achieved through an interestrate swap contract pay float and receive fixed 

interest rate fluctuations will generally not affect our future earnings or cash flows on our fixed rate debt and loans receivable unless such instruments mature or are otherwise terminated however interest rate changes will affect the fair value of our fixed rate instruments conversely changes in interest rates on variable rate debt and investments would change our future earnings and cash flows but not significantly affect the fair value of those instruments assuming a one percentage point increase in the interest rate related to the variablerate investments and variablerate debt and assuming no change in the outstanding balance as of december 31 2010 net interest income would improve by approximately 105 million or 003 per common share on a diluted basis assuming a 50 basis point decrease in interest rates under the above circumstances and taking into consideration that the index underlying many of our arrangements is currently below 50 basis points and is not expected to go below zero net interest income would decline by 52 million or less than 002 per common share on a diluted basis 

we use derivative financial instruments in the normal course of business to mitigate interest rate risk we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes derivatives are recorded on the consolidated balance sheet at their fair value see note 24 to the consolidated financial statements for further information 

to illustrate the effect of movements in the interest rate markets we performed a market sensitivity analysis on our hedging instruments we applied various basis point spreads to the underlying interest rate curves of the derivative portfolio in order to determine the instruments change in fair value assuming a one percentage point change in the underlying interest rate curve the estimated change in fair value of each of the underlying derivative instruments would not exceed 40 million see note 24 to the consolidated financial statements for additional analysis details 

the principal amount and the average interest rates for our loans receivable and debt categorized by maturity dates is presented in the table below the fair value for our senior unsecured notes payable is based on prevailing market prices the fair value estimates for loans receivable and mortgage debt payable are based on discounting future cash flows utilizing current rates for loans and debt of the same type and remaining maturity 



1 excludes 92 million of other debt that represents noninterest bearing life care bonds and occupancy fee deposits at three of our senior housing facilities which have no scheduled maturities 2 effective interest rate includes an interest rate swap contract pay float and receive fixed designated in a qualifying hedging relationship with a notional amount of 250 million that terminates in september 2011 the interest rate swap contact had a fixed rate of 595 and a floating rate of libor plus 421 at december 31 2010

business strategy 

our primary goal is to increase shareholder value through profitable growth our investment strategy to achieve this goal is based on three principles i opportunistic investing ii portfolio diversification and iii conservative financing 

opportunistic investing 

we make investment decisions that are expected to drive profitable growth and create shareholder value we attempt to position ourselves to create and take advantage of situations to meet our goals and investment criteria 

portfolio diversification 

we believe in maintaining a portfolio of healthcare investments diversified by segment geography operator tenant and investment product diversification reduces the likelihood that a single event would materially harm our business and allows us to take advantage of opportunities in different markets based on individual market dynamics while pursuing our strategy of diversification we monitor but do not limit our investments based on the percentage of our total assets that may be invested in any one property type investment product geographic location the number of properties which we may lease to a single operator or tenant or loans we may make to a single borrower with investments in multiple segments and investment products we can focus on opportunities with the best riskreward profile for the portfolio as a whole 

conservative financing 

we believe a conservative balance sheet is important to our ability to execute our opportunistic investing approach we strive to maintain a conservative balance sheet by actively managing our debttoequity levels and maintaining multiple sources of liquidity such as our revolving line of credit facility access to capital markets and secured debt lenders relationships with current and prospective 

institutional joint venture partners and our ability to divest of assets our debt is primarily fixed rate which reduces the impact of rising interest rates on our operations 

we may structure transactions as master leases require operator or tenant insurance and indemnifications obtain enhancements in the form of guarantees letters of credit or security deposits and take other measures to mitigate risk we finance our investments based on our evaluation of available sources of funding for shortterm purposes we may utilize our revolving line of credit facility or arrange for other shortterm borrowings from banks or other sources we arrange for longerterm financing through offerings of equity and debt securities placement of mortgage debt and capital from other institutional lenders and equity investors 

we specifically incorporate by reference into this section the information set forth in item 7 2009 transaction overview included elsewhere in this report 

competition 

investing in real estate is highly competitive we face competition from other reits investment companies private equity and hedge fund investors sovereign funds healthcare operators lenders developers and other institutional investors some of whom may have greater resources and lower costs of capital than us increased competition makes it more challenging for us to identify and successfully capitalize on opportunities that meet our objectives our ability to compete is also impacted by national and local economic trends availability of investment alternatives availability and cost of capital construction and renovation costs existing laws and regulations new legislation and population trends 

rental and related income from our facilities is dependent on the ability of our operators and tenants to compete with other operators and tenants on a number of different levels including the quality of care provided reputation the physical appearance of a facility price and range of services offered alternatives for healthcare delivery the supply of competing properties physicians staff referral sources location the size and demographics of the population in the surrounding area and the financial condition of our tenants and operators private federal and state payment programs and the effect of laws and regulations may also have a significant influence on the profitability of our tenants and operators for a discussion of the risks associated with competitive conditions affecting our business see risk factors in item 1a

investment products 

properties under lease at december 31 2009 our investment in properties leased to third parties aggregated approximately 10 billion representing 575 properties including 30 properties accounted for as direct financing leases dfls we primarily generate revenue by leasing properties under longterm leases most of our rents and other earned income from leases are received under triplenet leases or leases that provide for a substantial recovery of operating expenses however some of our mobs and life science facility rents are structured under gross or modified gross leases accordingly for such gross or modified gross leases we incur certain property operating expenses such as real estate taxes repairs and maintenance property management fees utilities and insurance 

our ability to grow rental income from properties under lease depends in part on our ability to i increase rental income and other earned income from leases by increasing rental rates and occupancy levels ii maximize tenant recoveries and iii control nonrecoverable operating expenses most of our leases include annual base rent escalation clauses that are either predetermined fixed increases andor are a function of an inflation index 

debt investments at december 31 2009 our mezzanine and mortgage loan investments aggregated 18 billion our mezzanine loans are generally secured by a pledge of ownership interests of an entity or entities which directly or indirectly own properties and are subordinate to more senior debt including mortgages and more senior mezzanine loans our mortgages are generally secured by healthcare real estate issued by healthcare providers

nonmanaging member llc downreits our downreit structures enable us to acquire and hold real estate properties in operating downreit llcs in connection with the formation of certain downreit llcs many members contribute appreciated real estate to the downreit llc in exchange for downreit units that can be exchanged at some future date for shares of our stock or at our election redeemed for cash these contributions are generally taxdeferred so that the precontribution gain related to the property is not taxed to the contributing member however if the contributed property is later sold by the downreit llc the unamortized precontribution gain that exists at the date of sale is specially allocated and taxed to the contributing members in many of these downreits we entered into indemnification agreements with our members under which if any of the appreciated real estate contributed by the members is sold by the downreit in a taxable transaction within a specified number of years after the property was contributed we will reimburse the affected members for the income taxes associated with the precontribution gain that is specially allocated to the affected member since the formation of our first downreit llc we have acquired more than 10 billion of properties utilizing downreit structures

government regulation licensing and enforcement 

overview 

our tenants and operators are typically subject to extensive and complex federal state and local healthcare laws and regulations relating to fraud and abuse practices government reimbursement licensure and certificate of need and similar laws governing the operation of healthcare facilities these regulations are wideranging and can subject our tenants and operators to civil criminal and administrative sanctions affected tenants and operators may find it increasingly difficult to comply with this complex and evolving regulatory environment because of a relative lack of guidance in many areas as certain of our healthcare properties are subject to oversight from several government agencies and the laws may vary from one jurisdiction to another changes in laws and regulations and reimbursement enforcement activity and regulatory noncompliance by our tenants and operators can all have a significant effect on their operations and financial condition which in turn may adversely impact us as detailed below and set forth under risk factors in item 1a 

we seek to mitigate the risk to us resulting from the significant healthcare regulatory risks faced by our tenants and operators by diversifying our portfolio among property types and geographical areas diversifying our tenant and operator base to limit our exposure to any single entity and seeking tenants and operators who are not primarily dependent on medicare or medicaid reimbursement for their revenues as of december 31 2009 our investments in our senior housing life science medical office hospital and skilled nursing segments represented approximately 35 24 18 8 and 15 of our portfolio respectively for the year ended december 31 2009 we estimate that approximately 14 and 7 of our tenants and operators revenues were derived from medicare and medicaid respectively based on information provided by our tenants and operators 

the following is a discussion of certain laws and regulations generally applicable to our operators and in certain cases to us 

fraud and abuse enforcement 

there are various extremely complex federal and state laws and regulations governing healthcare providers relationships and arrangements and prohibiting fraudulent and abusive practices by such providers these laws include i federal and state false claims acts which among other things prohibit providers from filing false claims or making false statements to receive payment from medicare medicaid or other federal or state healthcare programs ii federal and state antikickback and feesplitting statutes including the medicare and medicaid antikickback statute which prohibit the payment or receipt of remuneration to induce referrals or recommendations of healthcare items or services iii federal and state physician selfreferral laws commonly referred to as the stark law which generally prohibit referrals by physicians to entities with which the physician or an immediate family member has a financial relationship iv the federal civil monetary penalties law which prohibits among other things the knowing presentation of a false or fraudulent claim for certain healthcare services and v federal and state privacy laws including the privacy and security rules contained in the health insurance portability and accountability act of 1997 which provide for the privacy and security of personal health information violations of healthcare fraud and abuse laws carry 

civil criminal and administrative sanctions including punitive sanctions monetary penalties imprisonment denial of medicare and medicaid reimbursement and potential exclusion from medicare medicaid or other federal or state healthcare programs these laws are enforced by a variety of federal state and local agencies and can also be enforced by private litigants through among other things federal and state false claims acts which allow private litigants to bring qui tam or whistleblower actions many of our operators and tenants are subject to these laws and some of them may in the future become the subject of governmental enforcement actions if they fail to comply with applicable laws 

reimbursement 

sources of revenue for many of our tenants and operators include among other sources governmental healthcare programs such as the federal medicare program and state medicaid programs and nongovernmental payors such as insurance carriers and health maintenance organizations as federal and state governments focus on healthcare reform initiatives and as many states face significant budget deficits efforts to reduce costs by these payors will likely continue which may result in reduced or slower growth in reimbursement for certain services provided by some of our tenants and operators 

healthcare licensure and certificate of need 

certain healthcare facilities in our portfolio are subject to extensive federal state and local licensure certification and inspection laws and regulations in addition various licenses and permits are required to dispense narcotics operate pharmacies handle radioactive materials and operate equipment many states require certain healthcare providers to obtain a certificate of need which requires prior approval for the construction expansion and closure of certain healthcare facilities the approval process related to state certificate of need laws may impact some of our tenants and operators abilities to expand or change their businesses 

life science facilities 

while certain of our life science tenants include some wellestablished companies other such tenants are less established and in some cases may not yet have a product approved by the food and drug administration or other regulatory authorities for commercial sale creating a new pharmaceutical product requires significant investments of time and money in part because of the extensive regulation of the healthcare industry it also entails considerable risk of failure in demonstrating that the product is safe and effective and in gaining regulatory approval and market acceptance 

senior housing entrance fee communities 

certain of the senior housing facilities mortgaged to or owned by us are operated as entrance fee communities generally an entrance fee is an upfront fee or consideration paid by a resident a portion of which may be refundable in exchange for some form of longterm benefit some of the entrance fee communities are subject to significant state regulatory oversight including for example oversight of each facilitys financial condition establishment and monitoring of reserve requirements and other financial restrictions the right of residents to cancel their contracts within a specified period of time lien rights in favor of the residents restrictions on change of ownership and similar matters 

americans with disabilities act the ada 

our properties must comply with the ada and any similar state or local laws to the extent that such properties are public accommodations as defined in those statutes the ada may require removal of barriers to access by persons with disabilities in certain public areas of our properties where such removal is readily achievable should barriers to access by persons with disabilities be discovered at any of our properties we may be directly or indirectly responsible for additional costs that may be required to make facilities adacompliant noncompliance with the ada could result in the imposition of fines or an award of damages to private litigants the obligation to make readily achievable accommodations pursuant to the ada is an ongoing one and we continue to assess our properties and make modifications as appropriate in this respect 

environmental matters 

a wide variety of federal state and local environmental and occupational health and safety laws and regulations affect healthcare facility operations these complex federal and state statutes and their enforcement involve myriad regulations many of which involve strict liability on the part of the potential offender some of these federal and state statutes may directly impact us under various federal state and local environmental laws ordinances and regulations an owner of real property or a secured lender such as us may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of hazardous or toxic substances at under or disposed of in connection with such property as well as other potential costs relating to hazardous or toxic substances including government fines and damages for injuries to persons and adjacent property the cost of any required remediation removal fines or personal or property damages and the owners or secured lenders liability therefore could exceed or impair the value of the property andor the assets of the owner or secured lender in addition the presence of such substances or the failure to properly dispose of or remediate such substances may adversely affect the owners ability to sell or rent such property or to borrow using such property as collateral which in turn could reduce our revenues for a description of the risks associated with environmental matters see risk factors in item 1a of this report 




 item 1a risk factors 

  before deciding whether to invest in us you should carefully consider the risks described below as well as the risks described elsewhere in this report which risks are incorporated by reference into this section the risks and uncertainties described herein are not the only ones facing us and there may be additional risks that we do not presently know of or that we currently consider not likely to have a significant impact on us all of these risks could adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

as the owner of healthcare and other real estate facilities we are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties certain of these risks and uncertainties are generally associated directly with the business of owning and leasing real estate but others are associated with our specific business model or other attributes of ours for example as described elsewhere in this report most of our properties are operated by andor leased to third parties accordingly adverse developments with respect to these third parties may materially adversely affect us in addition we operate in a manner intended to allow us to qualify as a reit which involves the application of highly technical and complex laws and regulations we believe that the risks facing our company generally fall into the following four categories 

• risks related to hcp • risks related to our operators and tenants • risks related to tax matters including reitrelated risks and • risks related to our organizational structure risks related to hcp 

the continuation of volatility in the financial markets may impair our ability to raise capital obtain new financing or refinance existing obligations and fund real estate and development activities all of which may negatively impact our operating results and financial condition  

the global financial markets have undergone and may continue to experience pervasive and fundamental disruptions the continuation of this volatility may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations among other things the capital markets have experienced and may continue to see extreme pricing volatility dislocations and liquidity disruptions all of which may contribute further to downward pressure on stock prices widening credit spreads on prospective debt financing and declines in the market values of us and foreign stock exchanges while the capital markets have recently shown signs of improvement the sustainability of an economic recovery is uncertain and additional levels of market disruption and volatility could impact our ability to obtain new financing or refinance our existing obligations as they mature 

market volatility could also lead to significant uncertainty in the valuation of our investments and those of our joint ventures that may result in a substantial decrease in the value of our properties and those of our joint ventures as a result we may not be able to recover the carrying amount of such investments and the associated goodwill if any which may require us to recognize impairment charges in earnings 

we rely on external sources of capital to fund future capital needs and if our access to such capital is limited or on unfavorable terms we may not be able to meet commitments as they become due or make future investments necessary to grow our business 

in order to qualify as a reit under the internal revenue code of 1986 as amended the code and to avoid the nondeductible excise tax we are generally required among other things to distribute to our stockholders each year at least 90 of our real estate investment trust taxable income computed without regard to the dividends paid deduction and net capital gains under 

recent internal revenue service guidance up to 90 of any taxable dividend with respect to calendar years 2008 through 2011 and in some cases dividends declared as late as december 31 2012 could be payable in hcp inc stock if certain conditions are satisfied we may not be able to fund from cash retained from operations all future capital needs including capital needs in connection with acquisitions and development activities if we are unable to obtain needed capital at all or only on unfavorable terms from these sources we might not be able to make the investments needed to grow our business and to meet our obligations and commitments as they mature as a result we rely on external sources of capital including debt and equity financing to fulfill our capital requirements our access to capital depends upon a number of factors some of which we have little or no control over including but not limited to 

• general availability of credit and market conditions including rising interest rates and increased borrowing cost • the market price of the shares of our equity securities and the ratings of our debt and preferred securities • the markets perception of our growth potential and our current and potential future earnings and cash distributions • our degree of financial leverage and operational flexibility • financial deterioration of our lenders that might impair their ability to meet their commitments to us or their willingness to make additional loans to us and our inability to replace the financing commitment of any such lender on favorable terms or at all • the stability in the market value of our properties • the financial performance of our operators tenants and borrowers and • issues facing the healthcare industry including healthcare reform and changes in government reimbursement policies if our access to capital is limited by these or other factors it could have an impact on our ability to refinance our debt obligations fund dividend payments acquire properties and fund operations and development activities 

there is no assurance that we will make distributions in the future 

we intend to continue to pay quarterly distributions to our stockholders consistent with our historical practice however our ability to pay distributions may be adversely affected if any of the risks herein occur all distributions are made at the discretion of the board of directors and our future distributions will depend upon a number of factors including our earnings our current and anticipated cash available for distribution our financial condition maintenance of our reit tax status and such other factors as our board of directors may from time to time deem relevant there can be no assurance of our ability to pay distributions in the future and any reduction in distributions to our stockholders may negatively impact our stock price 

adverse changes in our credit ratings could impair our ability to obtain additional debt and preferred stock financing on favorable terms if at all and significantly reduce the market price of our securities including our common stock 

we currently have a credit rating of baa3 stable from moodys investors service moodys bbb stable from standard  poors ratings service sp and bbb positive from fitch ratings fitch on our senior unsecured debt securities and ba1 stable from moodys bb stable from sp and bb positive from fitch on our preferred equity securities the credit ratings of our senior unsecured debt and preferred equity securities are based on our operating performance liquidity and 

leverage ratios overall financial position and other factors employed by the credit rating agencies in their rating analyses of us our credit ratings can affect the amount and type of capital we can access as well as the terms of any financings we may obtain there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain our current credit ratings and in the event that our current credit ratings deteriorate we would likely incur higher borrowing costs and it may be more difficult or expensive to obtain additional financing or refinance existing obligations and commitments also a downgrade in our credit ratings would trigger additional costs or other potentially negative consequences under our current and future credit facilities and debt instruments 

our level of indebtedness could materially adversely affect us in many ways including reducing funds available for other business purposes and reducing our operational flexibility 

our indebtedness as of december 31 2009 was approximately 57 billion we may incur additional indebtedness in the future including in connection with the development or acquisition of assets which may be substantial any significant additional indebtedness could negatively affect the credit ratings of our debt and preferred equity securities and require a substantial portion of our cash flow to make interest and principal payments due on our indebtedness greater demands on our cash resources may reduce funds available to us to pay dividends conduct development activities make capital expenditures and acquisitions or carry out other aspects of our business strategy increased indebtedness can also limit our ability to adjust rapidly to changing market conditions make us more vulnerable to general adverse economic and industry conditions and create competitive disadvantages for us compared to other companies with relatively lower debt levels increased future debt service obligations may limit our operational flexibility including our ability to finance or refinance our properties contribute properties to joint ventures or sell properties as needed 

covenants in our existing and future credit agreements and other debt instruments limit our operational flexibility and a covenant breach or a default could materially adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

the terms of our credit agreements and other indebtedness including additional credit agreements or amendments we may enter into and other indebtedness we may incur in the future require or will require us to comply with a number of customary financial and other covenants such as maintaining certain levels of debt service coverage leverage ratio and tangible net worth requirements our continued ability to incur indebtedness and operate in general is subject to compliance with these financial and other covenants which limit our operational flexibility for example mortgages on our properties contain customary covenants such as those that limit or restrict our ability without the consent of the lender to further encumber or sell the applicable properties or to replace the applicable tenant or operator breaches of certain covenants may result in defaults under the mortgages on our properties and crossdefaults under certain of our other indebtedness even if we satisfy our payment obligations to the respective obligee in addition defaults under the leases or operating agreements related to mortgaged properties including defaults associated with the bankruptcy of the applicable tenant or operator may result in a default under the underlying mortgage and crossdefaults under certain of our other indebtedness covenants that limit our operational flexibility as well as defaults under our debt instruments could materially adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

an increase in interest rates would increase our interest costs on our existing variable rate debt and could increase interest cost on new debt and could adversely impact our ability to refinance existing debt sell assets and limit our acquisition and development activities 

if interest rates increase so could our interest costs for any new debt this increased cost could make the financing of any acquisition and development activity more costly we may incur more 

variable interest rate indebtedness in the future rising interest rates could limit our ability to refinance existing debt when it matures or cause us to pay higher interest rates upon refinancing and increase interest expense on refinanced indebtedness in addition an increase in interest rates could decrease the amount third parties are willing to pay for our assets thereby limiting our ability to reposition our portfolio promptly in response to changes in economic or other conditions 

unfavorable resolution of pending and future litigation matters and disputes could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition 

from time to time we may be directly involved in a number of legal proceedings lawsuits and other claims see legal proceedings in part i item 3 in this report for a discussion of certain legal proceedings in which we are involved we may also be named as defendants in lawsuits allegedly arising out of actions of our operators and tenants in which such operators and tenants have agreed to indemnify defend and hold us harmless from and against various claims litigation and liabilities arising in connection with their respective businesses see risks related to our operators and tenants— our operators and tenants are faced with litigation and may experience rising liability and insurance costs that may affect their ability to make their lease or mortgage payments  an unfavorable resolution of pending or future litigation may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operations regardless of its outcome litigation may result in substantial costs and expenses and significantly divert the attention of management there can be no assurance that we will be able to prevail in or achieve a favorable settlement of pending or future litigation in addition pending litigation or future litigation government proceedings or environmental matters could lead to increased costs or interruption of our normal business operations 

a small number of operators and tenants some of whom are experiencing significant legal financial and regulatory difficulties account for a large percentage of our revenues 

during the year ended december 31 2009 approximately 30 of our total revenues are generated by our leasing or financial arrangements with the following four companies sunrise 11 hcr manorcare 7 brookdale 6 and hca 6 certain of these companies are experiencing significant legal financial and regulatory difficulties among other things sunrise has disclosed that as of september 30 2009 it has no borrowing availability under its bank credit facility has significant scheduled debt maturities in 2009 and 2010 and significant longterm debt that is in default while we periodically evaluate the creditworthiness of our operators tenants and borrowers there can be no assurance that our operators tenants or borrowers will be able to meet their obligations to us the failure or inability of these operators tenants or borrowers to meet their obligations to us could materially reduce our cash flow as well as our results of operations which could in turn reduce the amount of dividends we pay cause our stock price to decline and have other material adverse effects see risks related to our operators and tenants— the bankruptcy insolvency or financial deterioration of one or more of our major operators or tenants may materially adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition  for additional information on the risks we face from a failure of one or more of our operators or tenants 

we have investments in mezzanine loans which are subject to a greater risk of loss than loans secured by the underlying real estate 

at december 31 2009 we had mezzanine loan investments with a carrying value of 934 million our mezzanine loans generally take the form of subordinated loans secured by a pledge of ownership interests in either the entity owning the property or a pledge of the ownership interests in the entity that owns directly or through other entities the interest in the entities owning the properties these types of investments involve a higher degree of risk than longterm senior mortgage loans secured by income producing real property because the investment may have a lesser likelihood of being repaid in 

full as a result of foreclosure by the senior lender in the event of a bankruptcy of the entity providing the pledge of its ownership interests as security we may not have full recourse to the assets of such entity or the assets of the entity may not be sufficient to fully repay our mezzanine loans if a borrower defaults on our mezzanine loans or debt senior to our loans or in the event of a borrower bankruptcy our mezzanine loans will be satisfied only after the senior debt is paid and consistent with bankruptcy rules as a result we may not recover some or all of our investment in addition mezzanine loans may have higher loantovalue ratios than conventional mortgage loans resulting in less equity in the property and increasing the risk of loss of principal if our mezzanine loans are not repaid or are only partially repaid our business results of operations and financial condition may be materially adversely affected 

we may be unable to successfully foreclose on the collateral securing our real estaterelated loans and even if we are successful in our foreclosure efforts we may be unable to successfully operate or occupy the underlying real estate which may adversely affect our ability to recover our investments 

if an operator or tenant defaults under one of our mortgages or mezzanine loans we may have to foreclose on the loan or protect our interest by acquiring title to the collateral in some cases as noted above the collateral consists of the equity interests in an entity that directly or indirectly owns the applicable real property and accordingly we may not have full recourse to assets of that entity operators tenants or borrowers may contest enforcement of foreclosure or other remedies seek bankruptcy protection against our exercise of enforcement or other remedies andor bring claims for lender liability in response to actions to enforce mortgage obligations foreclosurerelated costs high loantovalue ratios or declines in the value of the facility may prevent us from realizing an amount equal to our mortgage or mezzanine loan upon foreclosure even if we are able to successfully foreclose on the collateral securing our real estaterelated loans we may inherit properties for which we may be unable to expeditiously seek tenants or operators if at all which would adversely affect our ability to fully recover our investment 

required regulatory approvals can delay or prohibit transfers of our healthcare facilities 

transfers of healthcare facilities to successor tenants or operators may be subject to regulatory approvals including change of ownership approvals under certificate of need laws and medicare and medicaid provider arrangements that are not required for transfers of other types of commercial operations and other types of real estate the replacement of any tenant or operator could be delayed by the regulatory approval process of any federal state or local government agency necessary for the transfer of the facility or the replacement of the operator licensed to manage the facility if we are unable to find a suitable replacement tenant or operator upon favorable terms or at all we may take possession of a facility which might expose us to successor liability or require us to indemnify subsequent operators to whom we might transfer the operating rights and licenses all of which may adversely affect our revenues and operations 

we may not be able to sell properties when we desire because real estate investments are relatively illiquid 

real estate investments generally cannot be sold quickly in addition some of our properties serve as collateral for our secured debt obligations and cannot be readily sold we may not be able to vary our portfolio promptly in response to changes in the real estate market a downturn in the real estate market could adversely affect the value of our properties and our ability to sell such properties for a price or on terms acceptable to us we also cannot predict the length of time needed to find a willing purchaser and to close the sale of a property or portfolio of properties in addition there are provisions under the federal income tax laws applicable to reits that may limit our ability to recognize the full economic benefit from a sale of our assets these factors and any others that would impede our ability to respond to adverse changes in the performance of our properties could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

real estate is a competitive business and this competition may make it difficult to identify and purchase or develop suitable healthcare and other facilities to grow our operations through these activities or to successfully reinvest proceeds 

we operate in a highly competitive industry we face competition from other reits investment companies private equity and hedge fund investors sovereign funds healthcare operators lenders developers and other institutional investors some of whom may have greater resources and lower costs of capital than us increased competition makes it more challenging for us to identify and successfully capitalize on opportunities that meet our business goals if we cannot capitalize on our development pipeline identify and purchase a sufficient quantity of healthcare facilities at favorable prices or reinvest proceeds on a timely basis or if we are unable to finance acquisitions on commercially favorable terms our business results of operations and financial condition may be materially adversely affected 

because of the unique and specific improvements required for healthcare facilities we may be required to incur substantial development and renovation costs to make certain of our properties suitable for other operators and tenants which could materially adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

healthcare facilities are typically highly customized and may not be easily adapted to nonhealthcarerelated uses the improvements generally required to conform a property to healthcare use such as upgrading electrical gas and plumbing infrastructure are costly and at times tenantspecific a new or replacement operator or tenant may require different features in a property depending on that operators or tenants particular operations if a current operator or tenant is unable to pay rent and vacates a property we may incur substantial expenditures to modify a property before we are able to secure another operator or tenant also if the property needs to be renovated to accommodate multiple operators or tenants we may incur substantial expenditures before we are able to release the space these expenditures or renovations may materially adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

we face additional risks associated with property development that can render a project less profitable or not profitable at all and under certain circumstances prevent completion of development activities once undertaken all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

largescale groundup development of healthcare properties presents additional risks for us including risks that 

• a development opportunity may be abandoned after expending significant resources resulting in the loss of deposits or failure to recover expenses already incurred • the development and construction costs of a project may exceed original estimates due to increased interest rates and higher materials transportation labor leasing or other costs which could make the completion of the development project less profitable • construction andor permanent financing may not be available on favorable terms or at all • the project may not be completed on schedule which can result in increases in construction costs and debt service expenses as a result of a variety of factors that are beyond our control including natural disasters labor conditions material shortages regulatory hurdles civil unrest and acts of war and • occupancy rates and rents at a newly completed property may not meet expected levels and could be insufficient to make the property profitable 19 

these risks could result in substantial unanticipated delays or expenses and under certain circumstances could prevent completion of development activities once undertaken any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

our use of joint ventures may limit our flexibility with jointly owned investments and could adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

we intend to develop andor acquire properties in joint ventures with other persons or entities when circumstances warrant the use of these structures our participation in joint ventures is subject to risks that 

• we could experience an impasse on certain decisions because we do not have sole decisionmaking authority which could require us to expend additional resources on resolving such impasses or potential disputes • our joint venture partners could have investment goals that are not consistent with our investment objectives including the timing terms and strategies for any investments • our joint venture partners might become bankrupt fail to fund their share of required capital contributions or fail to fulfill their obligations as a joint venture partner which may require us to infuse our own capital into the venture on behalf of the partner despite other competing uses for such capital and • our joint venture partners may have competing interests in our markets that could create conflict of interest issues from time to time we acquire other companies and need to integrate them into our existing business if we are unable to successfully integrate the operations of acquired companies or they fail to perform as expected our business results of operations and financial condition may be materially adversely affected 

acquisitions require the integration of companies that have previously operated independently successful integration of the operations of these companies depends primarily on our ability to consolidate operations systems procedures properties and personnel and to eliminate redundancies and costs we cannot provide assurance that we will be able to integrate the operations of the companies that we have acquired or may acquire in the future without encountering difficulties potential difficulties associated with acquisitions include the loss of key employees the disruption of our ongoing business or that of the acquired entity possible inconsistencies in standards controls procedures and policies and the assumption of unexpected liabilities estimated cost savings in connection with acquisitions are typically projected to come from various areas that our management identifies through the due diligence and integration planning process yet our target companies and their properties may fail to perform as expected inaccurate assumptions regarding future rental or occupancy rates could result in overly optimistic estimates of future revenues similarly we may underestimate future operating expenses or the costs necessary to bring properties up to standards established for their intended use if we have difficulties with any of these areas or if we later discover additional liabilities or experience unforeseen costs relating to our acquired companies we might not achieve the economic benefits we expect from our acquisitions and this may materially adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

we are subject to significant corporate regulation as a public company and failure to comply with all applicable regulations could subject us to liability and negatively impact our stock price 

we are subject to significant regulation including the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 while we have developed corporate governance and compliance initiatives based on what we believe are the current best practices and periodically evaluate such initiatives in response to newly implemented or changing 

regulatory requirements we cannot provide assurance that we are or will be in compliance with all potentially applicable corporate regulations for example we are required to provide a report by management on internal control over financial reporting pursuant to the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 including managements assessment of the effectiveness of such control changes to our business will necessitate ongoing changes to our internal control systems and processes internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements because of its inherent limitations including the possibility of human error the circumvention or overriding of controls or fraud therefore even effective internal controls can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements if we fail to maintain the adequacy of our internal controls including any failure to implement required new or improved controls or if we experience difficulties in their implementation our business results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely harmed we could fail to meet our reporting obligations and there could be a material adverse effect on our stock price 

loss of our key personnel could temporarily disrupt our operations and adversely affect us 

we are dependent on the efforts of our executive officers although our chief executive officer has an employment agreement with us we cannot assure you that he will remain employed with us the loss or limited availability of the services of our chief executive officer or any of our executive officers or our inability to recruit and retain qualified personnel in the future could at least temporarily have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations and be negatively perceived in the capital markets 

we may experience uninsured or underinsured losses which could result in a significant loss of the capital we have invested in a property decrease anticipated future revenues or cause us to incur unanticipated expense 

we maintain comprehensive insurance coverage on our properties with terms conditions limits and deductibles that we believe are adequate and appropriate given the relative risk and costs of such coverage however a large number of our properties are located in areas exposed to earthquake windstorm and flood and may be subject to other losses in particular our life science portfolio is concentrated in areas known to be subject to earthquake activity while we purchase insurance for earthquake windstorm and flood that we believe is adequate in light of current industry practice and analysis prepared by outside consultants there is no assurance that such insurance will fully cover such losses these losses can decrease our anticipated revenues from a property and result in the loss of all or a portion of the capital we have invested in a property the insurance market for such exposures can be very volatile and we may be unable to purchase the limits and terms we desire on a commercially reasonable basis in the future in addition there are certain exposures where insurance is not purchased as we do not believe it is economically feasible to do so or where there is no viable insurance market 

environmental compliance costs and liabilities associated with our real estate related investments may materially impair the value of those investments 

under various federal state and local laws ordinances and regulations as a current or previous owner of real estate we may be required to investigate and clean up certain hazardous substances released at a property and may be held liable to a governmental entity or to third parties for property damage and for investigation and cleanup costs incurred by the third parties in connection with the contamination in addition some environmental laws create a lien on the contaminated site in favor of the government for damages and the costs it incurs in connection with the contamination although we i currently carry environmental insurance on our properties in an amount and subject to deductibles that we believe are commercially reasonable and ii generally require our operators and tenants to 

undertake to indemnify us for environmental liabilities they cause such liabilities could exceed the amount of our insurance the financial ability of the tenant or operator to indemnify us or the value of the contaminated property the presence of contamination or the failure to remediate contamination may adversely affect our ability to sell or lease the real estate or to borrow using the real estate as collateral as the owner of a site we may also be held liable under common law to third parties for damages and injuries resulting from environmental contamination emanating from the site we may also experience environmental liabilities arising from conditions not known to us 

risks related to our operators and tenants 

the bankruptcy insolvency or financial deterioration of one or more of our major operators or tenants may materially adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

we lease our properties directly to operators in most cases and in certain other cases we lease to thirdparty tenants who enter into longterm management agreements with operators to manage the properties although our leases financing arrangements and other agreements with our tenants and operators generally provide us the right under specified circumstances to terminate a lease evict an operator or tenant or demand immediate repayment of certain obligations to us the bankruptcy laws afford certain rights to a party that has filed for bankruptcy or reorganization that may render certain of these remedies unenforceable or at the least delay our ability to pursue such remedies for example we cannot evict a tenant or operator solely because of its bankruptcy filing a debtor has the right to assume or to assume and assign to a third party or reject its unexpired contracts in a bankruptcy proceeding if a debtor were to reject its leases with us our claim against the debtor for unpaid and future rents would be limited by the statutory cap set forth in the us bankruptcy code which may be substantially less than the remaining rent actually owed under the lease in addition the inability of our tenants or operators to make payments or comply with certain other lease obligations may affect our compliance with certain covenants contained in the mortgages on the properties leased or managed by such tenants and operators moreover if certain tenants or operators who lease or manage our mortgaged properties were to file for bankruptcy protection such action may result in a default under the underlying mortgage and crossdefaults under our other indebtedness although we believe that we would be able to secure amendments under the applicable agreements in those circumstances the bankruptcy of an applicable operator or tenant may potentially result in less favorable borrowing terms than currently available delays in the availability of funding or other material adverse consequences 

many of our operating leases also contain noncontingent rent escalators for which we recognize income on a straightline basis over the lease term this method results in rental income in the early years of a lease being higher than actual cash received creating a straightline rent receivable asset included in the caption other assets net on our consolidated balance sheets at some point during the lease depending on its terms the cash rent payments eventually exceed the straightline rent which results in the straightline rent receivable asset decreasing to zero over the remainder of the lease term we assess the collectibility of the straightline rent that is expected to be collected in a future period and depending on circumstances we may provide a reserve against the previously recognized straightline rent receivable asset for a portion up to its full value that we estimate may not be recoverable in addition upon acquisition of a leased property that we account for as an operating lease we may record leaserelated intangible assets the balance of straightline rent receivable at december 31 2009 net of allowances was 159 million we had approximately 390 million of leaserelated intangible assets net of amortization and 200 million of leaserelated intangible liabilities net of amortization associated with our operating leases at december 31 2009 to the extent any of the operators or tenants for our properties for the reasons discussed above become unable to pay amounts due we may be required to impair the carrying values of the straightline rents receivable or lease intangibles or may impair the related carrying value of leased properties 

the current us housing market may adversely affect our operators and tenants ability to increase or maintain occupancy levels at and rental income from our senior housing facilities 

our tenants and operators may have relatively flat or declining occupancy levels in the nearterm due to falling home prices declining incomes stagnant home sales and other economic factors seniors may choose to postpone their plans to move into senior housing facilities rather than sell their homes at a loss or for a profit below their expectations moreover tightening lending standards have made it more difficult for potential buyers to obtain mortgage financing all of which have contributed to the declining home sales in addition the senior housing segment may continue to experience a decline in occupancy associated with private pay residents choosing to move out of the facilities to be cared for at home by relatives due to the weak economy a material decline in our tenants and operators occupancy levels and revenues may make it more difficult for them to meet their financial obligations to us which could materially adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

operators and tenants that fail to comply with the requirements of governmental reimbursement programs such as medicare or medicaid licensing and certification requirements fraud and abuse regulations or new legislative developments may cease to operate or be unable to meet their financial and contractual obligations to us 

certain of our operators and tenants are affected by an extremely complex set of federal state and local laws and regulations that are subject to frequent and substantial changes sometimes applied retroactively resulting from legislation adoption of rules and regulations and administrative and judicial interpretations of existing law see item 1—business—government regulation licensing and enforcement above for example to the extent that any of our operators or tenants receive a significant portion of their revenues from governmental payors primarily medicare and medicaid such revenues may be subject to statutory and regulatory changes retroactive rate adjustments recovery of program overpayments or setoffs administrative rulings policy interpretations payment or other delays by fiscal intermediaries or carriers government funding restrictions at a program level or with respect to specific facilities and interruption or delays in payments due to any ongoing governmental investigations and audits at such property in recent years governmental payors have frozen or reduced payments to healthcare providers due to budgetary pressures healthcare reimbursement will likely continue to be of significant importance to federal and state authorities we cannot make any assessment as to the ultimate timing or the effect that any future legislative reforms may have on our operators and tenants costs of doing business and on the amount of reimbursement by government and other thirdparty payors the failure of any of our operators or tenants to comply with these laws requirements and regulations could adversely affect their ability to meet their financial and contractual obligations to us 

certain of our operators and tenants are also generally subject to extensive federal state and local licensure certification and inspection laws and regulations our operators or tenants failure to comply with any of these laws could result in loss of accreditation denial of reimbursement imposition of fines suspension or decertification from federal and state healthcare programs loss of license or closure of the facility for example certain of our properties may require a license andor certificate of need to operate failure of any operator or tenant to obtain a license or certificate of need or loss of a required license or certificate of need would prevent a facility from operating in the manner intended by such operator or tenant additionally failure of our operators and tenants to generally comply with applicable laws and regulations may have an adverse effect on facilities owned by or mortgaged to us and therefore may adversely impact us see item 1—business—government regulation licensing and enforcement—healthcare licensure and certificate of need above 

legislative proposals are introduced or proposed in congress and in some state legislatures each year that would affect major changes in the healthcare system either nationally or at the state level for example congress is currently considering comprehensive legislation that could make significant 

changes to the us healthcare system we cannot accurately predict whether any proposals will be adopted or if adopted what effect if any these proposals would have on our operators and tenants and thus our business 

increased competition as well as increased operating costs have resulted in lower net revenues for some of our operators and tenants and may affect their ability to meet their financial and other contractual obligations to us 

the healthcare industry is highly competitive and can become more competitive in the future the occupancy levels at and rental income from our facilities is dependent on the ability of our operators and tenants to compete with entities that have substantial capital resources these entities compete with other operators and tenants on a number of different levels including the quality of care provided reputation the physical appearance of a facility price the range of services offered family preference alternatives for healthcare delivery the supply of competing properties physicians staff referral sources location and the size and demographics of the population in the surrounding area private federal and state payment programs and the effect of laws and regulations may also have a significant influence on the profitability of the properties and their tenants our operators and tenants also compete with numerous other companies providing similar healthcare services or alternatives such as home health agencies life care at home communitybased service programs retirement communities and convalescent centers such competition which has intensified due to overbuilding in some segments in which we invest has caused the fillup rate of newly constructed buildings to slow and the monthly rate that many newly built and previously existing facilities were able to obtain for their services to decrease we cannot be certain that the operators and tenants of all of our facilities will be able to achieve occupancy and rate levels that will enable them to meet all of their obligations to us further many competing companies may have resources and attributes that are superior to those of our operators and tenants thus our operators and tenants may encounter increased competition in the future that could limit their ability to attract residents or expand their businesses which could materially adversely affect their ability to meet their financial and other contractual obligation to us potentially decreasing our revenues and increasing our collection and dispute costs 

our operators and tenants may not procure the necessary insurance to adequately insure against losses 

our leases generally require our tenants and operators to secure and maintain comprehensive liability and property insurance that covers us as well as the tenants and operators some types of losses may not be adequately insured by our tenants and operators should an uninsured loss or a loss in excess of insured limits occur we could incur liability or lose all or a portion of the capital we have invested in a property as well as the anticipated future revenues from the property in such an event we might nevertheless remain obligated for any mortgage debt or other financial obligations related to the property we continually review the insurance maintained by our tenants and operators however we cannot assure you that material uninsured losses or losses in excess of insurance proceeds will not occur in the future 

our operators and tenants are faced with litigation and may experience rising liability and insurance costs that may affect their ability to make their lease or mortgage payments 

in some states advocacy groups have been created to monitor the quality of care at healthcare facilities and these groups have brought litigation against the operators and tenants of such facilities also in several instances private litigation by patients has succeeded in winning large damage awards for alleged abuses the effect of this litigation and other potential litigation may materially increase the costs incurred by our operators and tenants for monitoring and reporting quality of care compliance in addition their cost of liability and medical malpractice insurance can be significant and may increase so long as the present healthcare litigation environment continues cost increases could cause our 

operators to be unable to make their lease or mortgage payments or fail to purchase the appropriate liability and malpractice insurance potentially decreasing our revenues and increasing our collection and litigation costs moreover to the extent we are required to take back the affected facilities from our operators and tenants our revenues from those facilities could be reduced or eliminated for an extended period of time in addition as a result of our ownership of healthcare facilities we may be named as a defendant in lawsuits allegedly arising from the actions of our operators or tenants which may require unanticipated expenditures on our part 

our tenants in the life science industry face high levels of regulation expense and uncertainty that may adversely affect their ability to make payments to us and consequently may materially adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

life science tenants particularly those involved in developing and marketing pharmaceutical products are subject to certain unique risks as follows 

• some of our tenants require significant outlays of funds for the research development and clinical testing of their products and technologies if private investors the government or other sources of funding are unavailable to support such activities a tenants business may be adversely affected or fail • the research development clinical testing manufacture and marketing of some of our tenants products require federal state and foreign regulatory approvals the approval process is typically long expensive and uncertain even if our tenants have sufficient funds to seek approvals one or all of their products may fail to obtain the required regulatory approvals on a timely basis or at all furthermore some tenants may only have a small number of products under development if one product fails to receive the required approvals at any stage of development it could significantly adversely affect our tenants entire business and its ability to make payments to us • even after a life science tenant gains regulatory approval and market acceptance the product may still present significant regulatory and liability risks such risks may include among others the possible later discovery of safety concerns competition from new products and ultimately the expiration of patent protection for the product these factors may have an adverse effect on the operations and financial condition of our life science tenants and therefore may adversely impact us • our tenants with marketable products may be adversely affected by healthcare reform and the reimbursement policies of government or private healthcare payors • our tenants may be unable to adequately protect their intellectual property under patent copyright or trade secret laws failure to do so could jeopardize their ability to profit from their efforts and to protect their products from competition we cannot assure you that our life science tenants will be successful in their businesses if our tenants businesses are adversely affected they may have difficulty making payments to us which could materially adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

tax and reitrelated risks 

loss of hcp incs tax status as a reit would substantially reduce our available funds and would have material adverse consequences to us 

commencing with its taxable year ended december 31 1985 hcp inc has operated in a manner that is intended to allow it to qualify as a reit for federal income tax purposes under the code in addition as described below we own the stock of hcp life science reit inc hcp life science 

reit which elected to be treated as a reit commencing with its initial taxable year ended december 31 2007 

qualification as a reit involves the application of highly technical and complex code provisions for which there are only limited judicial and administrative interpretations the determination of various factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control may affect the ability of hcp inc and hcp life science reit to qualify as reits if hcp life science reit were to fail to qualify as a reit hcp inc also would fail to qualify as a reit unless hcp inc or hcp life science reit could make use of certain relief provisions provided under the code to qualify as reits hcp inc and hcp life science reit must each satisfy a number of organizational operational stockholder ownership dividend distribution asset income and other requirements for example to qualify as a reit at least 95 of hcp incs gross income in any year must be derived from qualifying sources and hcp inc must make distributions to its stockholders aggregating annually at least 90 of its reit taxable income excluding net capital gains in addition new legislation treasury regulations administrative interpretations or court decisions may adversely affect our investors if such future events affected hcp incs ability to qualify as a reit for tax purposes although we believe that hcp inc and hcp life science reit have been organized and have operated in such manner we can give no assurance that hcp inc or hcp life science reit have qualified or will continue to qualify as a reit for tax purposes 

if hcp inc loses its reit status we will face serious tax consequences that will substantially reduce the funds available to make payments of principal and interest on the debt securities we issue and to make distributions to stockholders if hcp inc fails to qualify as a reit 

• it would not be allowed an income tax deduction for dividends distributed to stockholders and would be subject to federal and state income tax at regular corporate rates or alternative minimum tax rates • it could also be subject to increased local income taxes and • unless hcp inc is entitled to relief under statutory provisions it could not elect to be subject to tax as a reit for four taxable years following the year for which it was disqualified in addition if hcp inc fails to qualify as a reit it would not be required to make distributions to stockholders however all distributions to stockholders would be subject to tax as qualifying corporate dividends to the extent of hcp incs current and accumulated earnings and profits 

as a result of all these factors hcp incs failure to qualify as a reit also could impair our ability to expand our business and raise capital and could materially adversely affect the value of our common stock 

certain property transfers may generate prohibited transaction income resulting in a penalty tax on gain attributable to the transaction 

from time to time we may transfer or otherwise dispose of some of our properties under the code any gain resulting from transfers of properties that we hold as inventory or primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business would be treated as income from a prohibited transaction subject to a 100 penalty tax since we acquire properties for investment purposes we do not believe that our occasional transfers or disposals of property are properly treated as prohibited transactions however whether property is held for investment purposes is a question of fact that depends on all the facts and circumstances surrounding the particular transaction the internal revenue service may contend that certain transfers or disposals of properties by us are prohibited transactions while we believe that the internal revenue service would not prevail in any such dispute if the internal revenue service were to argue successfully that a transfer or disposition of property constituted a prohibited transaction then we would be required to pay a 100 penalty tax on any gain from the 

prohibited transaction in addition income from a prohibited transaction might adversely affect our ability to satisfy the income tests for qualification as a reit for federal income tax purposes 

to maintain our reit status we may be forced to borrow funds on a shortterm basis during unfavorable market conditions 

to qualify as a reit each year we must distribute to our stockholders at least 90 of our real estate investment trust taxable income computed without regard to our dividends paid deduction and our net capital gain if we distribute less than 100 of our reit taxable income in any year we will be subject to regular corporate income taxes in addition we will be subject to a 4 excise tax on the amount if any by which distributions paid by us in any calendar year are less than the sum of 85 of our ordinary income 95 of our capital gain net income and 100 of our undistributed income from prior years to maintain our reit status and avoid the payment of income and excise taxes we may need to borrow funds on a shortterm basis to meet the reit distribution requirements even if the thenprevailing market conditions are not favorable for these borrowings these shortterm borrowing needs could result from differences in timing between the actual receipt of cash and inclusion of income for federal income tax purposes or the effect of nondeductible capital expenditures the creation of reserves or required debt principal payments 

we may in the future choose to pay dividends in our own stock in which case you may be required to pay tax in excess of the cash you receive 

we may distribute taxable dividends that are partially payable in cash and partially payable in hcp inc stock under recent internal revenue service guidance up to 90 of any such taxable dividend with respect to calendar years 2008 through 2011 including in some cases dividends declared as late as december 31 2012 could be payable in hcp inc stock if certain conditions are satisfied taxable stockholders receiving such dividends will be required to include the full amount of the dividend as income to the extent of our current and accumulated earnings and profits for united states federal income tax purposes as a result a us stockholder may be required to pay tax with respect to such dividends in excess of the cash received if a us stockholder sells the stock it receives as a dividend in order to pay this tax the sales proceeds may be less than the amount included in income with respect to the dividend depending on the market price of hcp inc stock at the time of the sale furthermore with respect to nonus stockholders we may be required to withhold us tax with respect to such dividends including in respect of all or a portion of such dividend that is payable in stock in addition if a significant number of our stockholders sell shares of stock in order to pay taxes owed on dividends such sales may put downward pressure on the trading price of our stock 

as a result of the acquisition of slough estates usa inc seusa hcp life science reit may have inherited tax liabilities and attributes from seusa 

hcp life science reit is the successor to the tax attributes including tax basis and earnings and profits if any of seusa if hcp life science reit recognizes gain on the disposition of any properties formerly owned by seusa during the tenyear period beginning on the date on which it acquired the seusa stock it will be required to pay tax at the highest regular corporate tax rate on such gain to the extent of the excess of a the fair market value of the asset over b its adjusted basis in the asset in each case determined as of the date on which it acquired the seusa stock any taxes paid by hcp life science reit would reduce the amount available for distribution by hcp life science reit to us 

as a result of the cnl retirement properties inc crp merger and the cnl retirement corp crc merger we may have inherited tax liabilities and attributes from crp and crc 

in connection with the crp merger crps reit counsel rendered an opinion to us dated as of the closing date of the merger substantially to the effect that on the basis of the facts representations and assumptions set forth or referred to in such opinion crp qualified as a reit under the code for the taxable years ending december 31 1999 through the closing date of the merger if however contrary to the opinion of crps reit counsel crp failed to qualify as a reit for any of its taxable years it would be required to pay federal income tax including any applicable alternative minimum tax on its taxable income at regular corporate rates because the crp merger was treated for income tax purposes as if crp sold all of its assets in a taxable transaction to hcp inc if crp did not qualify as a reit for the taxable year of the merger it would be subject to tax on the excess of the fair market value of its assets over their adjusted tax basis as a successor in interest to crp hcp inc would be required to pay this tax 

as a result of the crc merger hcp inc succeeded to the assets and the liabilities of crc including any liabilities for unpaid taxes and any tax liabilities created in connection with the crc merger at the closing of the crc merger we received an opinion of our counsel substantially to the effect that on the basis of the facts representations and assumptions set forth or referred to in such opinion for federal income tax purposes the crc merger qualified as a reorganization within the meaning of section 368a of the code if however contrary to the opinion of our counsel the crc merger did not qualify as a reorganization within the meaning of section 368a of the code the crc merger would have been treated as a sale of crcs assets to hcp inc in a taxable transaction and crc would have recognized taxable gain in such a case as crcs successorininterest hcp inc would be required to pay the tax on any such gain 

as a result of the crc merger and the acquisition of seusa hcp inc andor our subsidiary hcp life science reit may be required to distribute earnings and profits 

hcp inc succeeded to the tax attributes including the earnings and profits of crc assuming the crc merger qualified as reorganizations under the code similarly hcp life science reit succeeded to the tax attributes including the earnings and profits of seusa to qualify as a reit hcp inc and hcp life science reit must have distributed any nonreit earnings and profits by the close of the taxable year in which each of these transactions occurred any adjustments to the income of crc or seusa for taxable years ending on or before the closing date of the applicable transactions including as a result of an examination of the tax returns of either company by the internal revenue service could affect the calculation of such companys earnings and profits if the internal revenue service were to determine that hcp inc or hcp life science reit acquired nonreit earnings and profits from one or more of these predecessor entities that hcp inc or hcp life science reit failed to distribute prior to the end of the taxable year in which the applicable transaction occurred hcp inc and hcp life science reit could avoid disqualification as a reit by paying a deficiency dividend under these procedures hcp inc or hcp life science reit generally would be required to distribute any such nonreit earnings and profits to its respective stockholders within 90 days of the determination and pay a statutory interest charge at a specified rate to the internal revenue service such a distribution would be in addition to the distribution of reit taxable income necessary to satisfy the reit distribution requirement and may require that hcp inc or hcp life science reit as applicable borrow funds to make the distribution even if the thenprevailing market conditions are not favorable for borrowings in addition payment of the statutory interest charge could materially adversely affect the cash flow of the applicable reit 

risks related to our organizational structure 

our charter contains ownership limits with respect to our common stock and other classes of capital stock 

our charter subject to certain exceptions contains restrictions on the ownership and transfer of our common stock and preferred stock that are intended to assist us in preserving our qualification as a reit under our charter subject to certain exceptions no person or entity may own actually or constructively more than 98 by value or by number of shares whichever is more restrictive of the outstanding shares of our common or preferred stock 

additionally our charter has a 99 ownership limitation on the companys voting shares which may include common stock or other classes of capital stock our board of directors in its sole discretion may exempt a proposed transferee from either ownership limit the ownership limits may delay defer or prevent a transaction or a change of control that might involve a premium price for our common stock or might otherwise be in the best interests of our stockholders 

certain provisions of maryland law and our charter and bylaws could hinder delay or prevent a change in control transaction even if the transaction involves a premium price for our common stock or our stockholders believe such transaction to be otherwise in their best interests 

certain provisions of maryland law our charter and our bylaws have the effect of discouraging delaying or preventing transactions that involve an actual or threatened change in control even if these transactions involve a premium price for our common stock or our stockholders believe such transaction to be otherwise in their best interests these provisions include the following 

• removal of directors subject to the rights of one or more classes or series of preferred stock to elect one or more directors our charter provides that a director may only be removed by the affirmative vote or written consent of the holders of at least twothirds of the outstanding shares or by a unanimous vote of all other members of the board of directors • stockholder requested special meetings our bylaws only permit our stockholders to call a special meeting upon the written request of the stockholders holding in the aggregate not less than 50 of the outstanding shares entitled to vote on the business proposed to be transacted at such meeting • advance notice provisions for stockholder nominations and proposals our bylaws do not permit stockholders to nominate persons for election as directors at or to bring other business before any meeting of stockholders unless we are notified in a timely manner in writing prior to the meeting • preferred stock under our charter our board of directors has authority to issue preferred stock from time to time in one or more series and to establish the terms preferences and rights of any such series of preferred stock all without the approval of our stockholders • duties of directors with respect to unsolicited takeovers maryland law provides protection for maryland corporations against unsolicited takeovers by limiting among other things the duties of the directors in unsolicited takeover situations the duties of directors of maryland corporations do not require them to a accept recommend or respond to any proposal by a person seeking to acquire control of the corporation b make a determination under the maryland business combination act or the maryland control share acquisition act or c act or fail to act solely because of the effect that the act or failure to act may have on an acquisition or potential acquisition of control of the corporation or the amount or type of consideration that may be offered or paid to the stockholders in an acquisition moreover an act of a director of a maryland corporation relating to or affecting an acquisition or potential acquisition of control is not subject to any higher duty or greater scrutiny than is applied to any other act of a director 29 

maryland law also contains a statutory presumption that an act of a director of a maryland corporation satisfies the applicable standards of conduct for directors under maryland law 

• unsolicited takeovers under maryland law a maryland corporation with a class of equity securities registered under the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended and at least three independent directors may elect to be subject to certain statutory provisions relating to unsolicited takeovers which among other things would automatically classify the board of directors into three classes with staggered terms of three years each and vest in the board of directors the exclusive right to determine the number of directors and the exclusive right by the affirmative vote of a majority of the remaining directors to fill vacancies on the board of directors even if the remaining directors do not constitute a quorum these statutory provisions relating to unsolicited takeovers also provide that any director elected to fill a vacancy shall hold office for the remainder of the full term of the class of directors in which the vacancy occurred rather than the next annual meeting of directors as would otherwise be the case and until the directors successor is elected and qualified an election to be subject to any or all of the foregoing statutory provisions may be made in our charter or bylaws or by resolution of our board of directors without stockholder approval any such statutory provision to which we elect to be subject will apply even if other provisions of maryland law or our charter or bylaws provide to the contrary neither our charter nor our bylaws provides that we are subject to any of the foregoing statutory provisions relating to unsolicited takeovers however our board of directors could adopt a resolution without stockholder approval to elect to become subject to some or all of these statutory provisions 

if we made an election to be subject to such statutory provisions and our board of directors was divided into three classes with staggered terms of office of three years each the classification and staggered terms of office of our directors would make it more difficult for a third party to gain control of our board of directors since at least two annual meetings of stockholders instead of one generally would be required to effect a change in the majority of our board of directors 

• maryland business combination act the maryland business combination act provides that unless exempted a maryland corporation may not engage in business combinations including mergers dispositions of 10 or more of its assets issuances of shares of stock and other specified transactions with an interested stockholder or an affiliate of an interested stockholder for five years after the most recent date on which the interested stockholder became an interested stockholder and thereafter unless specified criteria are met an interested stockholder is generally a person owning or controlling directly or indirectly 10 or more of the voting power of the outstanding stock of a maryland corporation unless our board of directors takes action to exempt us generally or with respect to certain transactions from this statute in the future the maryland business combination act will be applicable to business combinations between us and other persons in addition to the restrictions on business combinations provided under maryland law our charter also contains restrictions on business combinations our charter requires that except in some circumstances business combinations between us and a related person including a beneficial holder of 10 or more of our outstanding voting stock be approved by the affirmative vote of at least 90 of our outstanding voting shares • maryland control share acquisition act maryland law provides that control shares of a corporation acquired in a control share acquisition shall have no voting rights except to the extent approved by a vote of twothirds of the votes eligible to be cast on the matter under the maryland control share acquisition act control shares means shares of stock that if aggregated with all other shares of stock previously acquired by the acquiror would entitle the 30 

acquiror to exercise voting power in electing directors within one of the following ranges of the voting power onetenth or more but less than onethird onethird or more but less than a majority or a majority or more of all voting power a control share acquisition means the acquisition of control shares subject to certain exceptions 

if voting rights or control shares acquired in a control share acquisition are not approved at a stockholders meeting or if the acquiring person does not deliver an acquiring person statement as required by the maryland control share acquisition act then subject to certain conditions and limitations the issuer may redeem any or all of the control shares for fair value if voting rights of such control shares are approved at a stockholders meeting and the acquiror becomes entitled to vote a majority of the shares of stock entitled to vote all other stockholders may exercise appraisal rights our bylaws contain a provision exempting acquisitions of our shares from the maryland control share acquisition act however our board of directors may amend our bylaws in the future to repeal or modify this exemption in which case any control shares of our company acquired in a control share acquisition will be subject to the maryland control acquisition act 

our issuance of additional shares of common or preferred stock warrants or debt securities may dilute the ownership interests of existing stockholders and reduce the market price for our shares 

as of december 31 2009 we had 2935 million shares of common stock issued and outstanding we cannot predict the effect if any that potential future sales of our common or preferred stock warrants or debt securities or the availability of our securities for future sale will have on the market price of our outstanding securities including our common stock sales of substantial amounts of our common or preferred stock warrants or debt securities convertible into or exercisable or exchangeable for common stock in the public market or the perception that such sales might occur could reduce the market price of our common stock the sales of any such securities could also dilute the interests of existing common stockholders and may cause a decrease in the market price of our common stock additionally we maintain equity incentive plans for our employees we have historically made grants of stock options restricted stock and restricted stock units to our employees under such plans and we expect to continue to do so as of december 31 2009 there were options to purchase approximately 67 million shares of our common stock outstanding of which 25 million shares are exercisable approximately 509000 unvested shares of restricted stock issued and outstanding and approximately 980000 unvested restricted stock units issued and outstanding under our equity incentive plans

the information set forth in this item 7 is intended to provide readers with an understanding of our financial condition changes in financial condition and results of operations we will discuss and provide our analysis in the following order 

• executive summary • 2009 transaction overview • dividends • critical accounting policies • results of operations • liquidity and capital resources • offbalance sheet arrangements • contractual obligations • inflation • recent accounting pronouncements executive summary 

we are a selfadministered reit that together with our consolidated subsidiaries invests primarily in real estate serving the healthcare industry in the us we acquire develop lease manage and dispose of healthcare real estate and provide financing to healthcare providers at december 31 2009 our portfolio of investments including properties owned by our investment management platform consisted of interests in 675 facilities and 18 billion of mezzanine and other secured loan investments 

our business strategy is based on three principles i opportunistic investing ii portfolio diversification and iii conservative financing we actively redeploy capital from investments with lower return potential into assets with higher return potential and recycle capital from shorterterm to longerterm investments we make investments where the expected riskadjusted return exceeds our cost of capital and strive to leverage our operator tenant and other business relationships 

our strategy contemplates acquiring and developing properties on terms that are favorable to us we attempt to structure transactions that are taxadvantaged and mitigate risks in our underwriting process generally we prefer larger more complex private transactions that leverage our management teams experience and our infrastructure 

we follow a disciplined approach to enhancing the value of our existing portfolio including ongoing evaluation of potential disposition of properties that no longer fit our strategy during the year ended december 31 2009 we sold 14 properties for 72 million recognizing gain on sales of real estate of 37 million and hca marketable debt securities for 157 million resulting in gains of 9 million 

we primarily generate revenue by leasing healthcare properties under longterm leases most of our rents and other earned income from leases are received under triplenet leases or leases that provide for substantial recovery of operating expenses however some of our medical office and life science leases are structured as gross or modified gross leases accordingly for such mobs and life science facilities we incur certain property operating expenses such as real estate taxes repairs and maintenance property management fees utilities and insurance our growth depends in part on our ability to i increase rental income and other earned income from leases by increasing rental rates and occupancy levels ii maximize tenant recoveries given underlying lease structures and iii control operating and other expenses our operations are impacted by property specific market specific general economic and other conditions 

access to capital markets impacts our cost of capital and ability to refinance maturing indebtedness as well as to fund future acquisitions and development through the issuance of additional securities or secured debt access to external capital on favorable terms is critical to the success of our strategy during 2009 we closed 881 million of equity capital offerings through the issuance of common stock 

2009 transaction overview 

investment transactions 

during the year ended december 31 2009 we made aggregate investments of 724 million as follows i purchased a 720 million participation in the first mortgage debt of hcr manorcare at a discount of 130 million which resulted in an acquisition cost of 590 million that is discussed below ii purchased the remaining interests in three senior housing joint ventures with an aggregate unencumbered value of 15 million and iii funded 119 million for construction and other capital projects primarily in our life science segment

critical accounting policies 

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap requires our management to use judgment in the application of accounting policies including making estimates and assumptions we base estimates on our experience and on various other assumptions believed to be reasonable under the circumstances these estimates affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods if our judgment or interpretation of the facts and circumstances relating to various transactions or other matters had been different it is possible that different accounting would have been applied resulting in a different presentation of our consolidated financial statements from time to time we reevaluate our estimates and assumptions in the event estimates or assumptions prove to be different from actual results adjustments are made in subsequent periods to reflect more current estimates and 

assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain for a more detailed discussion of our significant accounting policies see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements in this report 

principles of consolidation 

the consolidated financial statements include the accounts of hcp our whollyowned subsidiaries and joint ventures that we control through voting rights or other means we consolidate investments in variable interest entities vies when we are the primary beneficiary of the vie at either the creation of the variable interest entity or upon the occurrence of a qualifying reconsideration event 

we make judgments with respect to our level of influence or control of an entity and whether we are or are not the primary beneficiary of a vie consideration of various factors including but not limited to the form of our ownership interest our representation on the entitys governing body the size and seniority of our investment various cash flow scenarios related to the vie our ability to participate in policy making decisions and the rights of the other investors to participate in the decision making process and to replace us as manager andor liquidate the venture if applicable our ability to correctly assess our influence or control over an entity at inception of our involvement or upon a reconsideration event and determine the primary beneficiary of a vie affects the presentation of these entities in our consolidated financial statements if we were to perform a primary beneficiary analysis upon the occurrence of a future reconsideration event our assumptions may be different which could result in the identification of a different primary beneficiary 

if we determine that we are the primary beneficiary of a vie our consolidated financial statements would include the results of the vie either tenant or borrower rather than the results of our lease or loan to the vie we would depend on the vie to provide us timely financial information and we would rely on the internal controls of the vie to provide accurate financial information if the vie has deficiencies in its internal controls over financial reporting or does not provide us with timely financial information this may adversely impact our financial reporting and our internal controls over financial reporting 

revenue recognition 

we recognize rental revenue on a straightline basis over the lease term when collectibility is reasonably assured and the tenant has taken possession or controls the physical use of the leased asset for assets acquired subject to leases we recognize revenue upon acquisition of the asset provided the tenant has taken possession or controls the physical use of the leased asset if the lease provides for tenant improvements we determine whether the tenant improvements for accounting purposes are owned by the tenant or us when we are the owner of the tenant improvements the tenant is not considered to have taken physical possession or have control of the physical use of the leased asset until the tenant improvements are substantially completed when the tenant is the owner of the tenant improvements any tenant improvement allowance funded is treated as a lease incentive and amortized as a reduction of revenue over the lease term the determination of ownership of the tenant improvements is subject to significant judgment if our assessment of the owner of the tenant improvements for accounting purposes were to change the timing and amount of our revenue recognized would be impacted 

certain leases provide for additional rents contingent upon a percentage of the facilitys revenue in excess of specified base amounts or other thresholds such revenue is recognized when actual results reported by the tenant or estimates of tenant results exceed the base amount or other thresholds the recognition of additional rents requires us to make estimates of amounts owed and to a certain extent are dependent on the accuracy of the facility results reported to us our estimates may differ from actual results which could be material to our consolidated financial statements 

we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts including an allowance for straightline rent receivables for estimated losses resulting from tenant defaults or the inability of tenants to make contractual rent and tenant recovery payments we monitor the liquidity and creditworthiness of our tenants and operators on an ongoing basis this evaluation considers industry and economic conditions property performance credit enhancements and other factors for straightline rent amounts our assessment is based on income recoverable over the term of the lease we exercise judgment in establishing allowances and consider payment history and current credit status in developing these estimates these estimates may differ from actual results which could be material to our consolidated financial statements 

loans receivable are classified as heldforinvestment based on managements intent and ability to hold the loans for the foreseeable future or to maturity we recognize interest income on loans including the amortization of discounts and premiums using the effective interest method applied on a loanbyloan basis when collectibility of the future payments is reasonably assured premiums discounts and related costs are recognized as yield adjustments over the life of the related loans 

we use the direct finance method of accounting to record income from dfls for leases accounted for as dfls future minimum lease payments are recorded as a receivable the difference between the future minimum lease payments and the estimated residual values less the cost of the properties is recorded as unearned income unearned income is deferred and amortized to income over the lease terms to provide a constant yield when collectibility of the lease payments is reasonably assured investments in dfls are presented net of unamortized unearned income 

loans and dfls are placed on nonaccrual status at such time as management determines that collectibility of contractual amounts is not reasonably assured while on nonaccrual status loans or dfls are either accounted for on a cash basis in which income is recognized only upon receipt of cash or on a costrecovery basis in which all cash receipts reduce the carrying value of the loan or dfl based on managements judgment of collectibility 

allowances are established for loans and dfls based upon a probable loss estimate for individual loans and dfls deemed to be impaired loans and dfls are impaired when it is deemed probable that we will be unable to collect all amounts due on a timely basis in accordance with the contractual terms of the loan or lease determining the adequacy of the allowance is complex and requires significant judgment by us about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain the allowance is based upon our assessment of the borrowers or lessees overall financial condition resources and payment record the prospects for support from any financially responsible guarantors and if appropriate the realizable value of any collateral these estimates consider all available evidence including as appropriate the present value of the expected future cash flows discounted at the loans or dfls effective interest rate the fair value of collateral general economic conditions and trends historical and industry loss experience and other relevant factors while our assumptions are based in part upon historical data our estimates may differ from actual results which could be material to our consolidated financial statements 

real estate 

we make estimates as part of our allocation of the purchase price of acquisitions to the various components of the acquisition based upon the relative value of each component the most significant components of our allocations are typically the allocation of fair value to the buildings asifvacant land and market value of inplace leases in the case of the fair value of buildings and the allocation of value to land and other intangibles our estimates of the values of these components will affect the amount of depreciation we record over the estimated useful life of the property acquired or the remaining lease term in the case of the market value of inplace leases we make our best estimates based on our evaluation of the specific characteristics of each tenants lease factors considered include 

estimates of carrying costs during hypothetical expected leaseup periods market conditions and costs to execute similar leases our assumptions affect the amount of future revenue that we will recognize over the remaining lease term for the acquired inplace leases 

a variety of costs are incurred in the acquisition development and leasing of properties after determination is made to capitalize a cost it is allocated to the specific component of a project that is benefited determination of when a development project is substantially complete and capitalization must cease involves a degree of judgment the costs of land and buildings under development include specifically identifiable costs the capitalized costs include preconstruction costs essential to the development of the property development costs construction costs interest costs real estate taxes and other costs incurred during the period of development we consider a construction project as substantially completed and held available for occupancy and cease capitalization of costs upon the completion of the related tenant improvements 

impairment of longlived assets and goodwill 

we assess the carrying value of our real estate assets and related intangibles real estate assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable goodwill is tested at least annually by applying the twostep approach if the sum of the expected future net undiscounted cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the real estate assets an impairment loss will be recognized by adjusting the assets carrying amount to its estimated fair value if the fair value of a reporting unit containing goodwill is less than its carrying value then a second step of the test is needed to measure the amount of potential goodwill impairment the second step requires the fair value of the reporting unit to be allocated to all the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination at the date of the impairment test the excess of the fair value of the reporting unit over the fair value of assets and liabilities is the implied value of goodwill and is used to determine the amount of impairment the determination of the fair value of real estate assets and goodwill involves significant judgment this judgment is based on our analysis and estimates of fair value of real estate assets and reporting units and the future operating results and resulting cash flows of each real estate asset whose carrying amount may not be recoverable our ability to accurately predict future operating results and cash flows and estimate and allocate fair values impacts the timing and recognition of impairments while we believe our assumptions are reasonable changes in these assumptions may have a material impact on our financial results 

investments in unconsolidated joint ventures 

investments in entities which we do not consolidate but for which we have the ability to exercise significant influence over operating and financial policies are reported under the equity method of accounting under the equity method of accounting our share of the investees earnings or losses are included in our consolidated results of operations 

the initial carrying value of investments in unconsolidated joint ventures is based on the amount paid to purchase the joint venture interest or the carrying value of the assets prior to the sale of interests in the joint venture we evaluate our equity method investments for impairment based upon a comparison of the fair value of the equity method investment to our carrying value when we determine a decline in the fair value of our investment in an unconsolidated joint venture is below its carrying value is otherthantemporary an impairment is recorded the determination of the fair value of investments in unconsolidated joint ventures involves significant judgment our estimates consider all available evidence including as appropriate the present value of the expected future cash flows discounted at market rates general economic conditions and trends and other relevant factors capitalization rates discount rates and credit spreads utilized in our valuation models are based upon rates that we believe to be within a reasonable range of current market rates for the respective

our leases often provide for either fixed increases in base rents or indexed escalators based on the consumer price index or other measures andor additional rent based on increases in the tenants operating revenues substantially all of our mob leases require the tenant to pay a share of property operating costs such as real estate taxes insurance and utilities substantially all of our senior housing life science skilled nursing and hospital leases require the operator or tenant to pay all of the property operating costs or reimburse us for all such costs we believe that inflationary increases in expenses will 

be offset in part by the operator or tenant expense reimbursements and contractual rent increases described above

interest rate fluctuations will generally not affect our future earnings or cash flows on our fixed rate debt loans receivable and debt securities unless such instruments mature or are otherwise terminated however interest rate changes will affect the fair value of our fixed rate instruments conversely changes in interest rates on variable rate debt and investments would change our future earnings and cash flows but not significantly affect the fair value of those instruments assuming a one percentage point increase in the interest rate related to the variablerate investments and variablerate debt and assuming no change in the outstanding balance as of december 31 2009 net interest income would improve by approximately 31 million or 001 per common share on a diluted basis assuming a 50 basis point decrease in interest rates under the above circumstances and taking into consideration that the index underlying many of our arrangements is currently below 50 basis points and is not expected to go below zero net interest income would decline by 16 million or less than 001 per common share on a diluted basis 

we use derivative financial instruments in the normal course of business to manage or hedge interest rate risk we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes derivatives are recorded on the consolidated balance sheet at their estimated fair value see note 24 to the consolidated financial statements in this report for further information 

to illustrate the effect of movements in the interest rate markets we performed a market sensitivity analysis on our hedging instruments we applied various basis point spreads to the underlying interest rate curves of the derivative portfolio in order to determine the instruments change in estimated fair value assuming a one percentage point change in the underlying interest rate curve the estimated change in fair value of each of the underlying derivative instruments would not exceed 43 million 

market risk we are directly and indirectly affected by changes in the equity and bond markets we have investments in marketable debt and equity securities classified as availableforsale gains and losses on these securities are recognized in income when realized and losses are recognized when an otherthantemporary decline in value is identified the initial indicator of an otherthantemporary decline in value for marketable equity securities is a sustained decline in market price below the carrying value for an extended period of time we consider a variety of factors in evaluating an otherthantemporary decline in value such as the length of time and the extent to which the market value has been less than our cost the issuers financial condition capital strength and nearterm prospects any recent events specific to that issuer and economic conditions of its industry and our 

investment horizon in relationship to an anticipated nearterm recovery in the stock or bond price if any at december 31 2009 the fair value and cost or the adjusted cost basis for those securities where a recognized loss was recorded of marketable equity securities was 35 million and 37 million respectively and the fair value and cost basis of marketable debt securities was 1728 million and 1608 million respectively 

the principal amount and the average interest rates for our loans receivable and debt categorized by maturity dates is presented in the table below the fair value for our debt securities and senior unsecured notes payable are based on prevailing market prices the fair value estimates for loans receivable and mortgage debt payable are based on discounting future cash flows utilizing current rates offered to us for loans and debt of the same type and remaining maturity 



1 excludes 999 million of other debt that represents noninterest bearing life care bonds and occupancy fee deposits at three of our senior housing facilities which have no scheduled maturities 2 effective interest rate includes an interest rate swap contract pay float and receive fixed designated in a qualifying hedging relationship with a notional amount of 250 million that terminates in september 2011 the interest rate swap contact had a fixed rate of 595 and a floating rate of libor plus 421 at december 31 2009

the delivery of healthcare services requires real estate and as a result tenants and operators depend on real estate in part to maintain and grow their businesses we believe that the healthcare real estate market provides investment opportunities due to the

business strategy 

our primary goal is to increase shareholder value through profitable growth our investment strategy to achieve this goal is based on three principles—opportunistic investing portfolio diversification and conservative financing 

opportunistic investing 

we make investment decisions that are expected to drive profitable growth and create shareholder value we attempt to position ourselves to create and take advantage of situations to meet our goals and investment criteria 

portfolio diversification 

we believe in maintaining a portfolio of healthcare investments diversified by segment geography operator tenant and investment product diversification reduces the likelihood that a single event would materially harm our business and allows us to take advantage of opportunities in different markets based on individual market dynamics while pursuing our strategy of diversification we monitor but do not limit our investments based on the percentage of our total assets that may be invested in any one property type investment product geographic location the number of properties which we may lease to a single operator or tenant or loans we may make to a single borrower with investments in multiple segments and investment products we can focus on opportunities with the best riskreward profile for the portfolio as a whole 

conservative financing 

we believe a conservative balance sheet is important to our ability to execute our opportunistic investing approach we strive to maintain a conservative balance sheet by actively managing our debttoequity levels and maintaining multiple sources of liquidity such as our revolving line of credit access to capital markets and secured debt lenders and our ability to divest of assets our debt is primarily 

fixed rate which reduces the impact of rising interest rates on our operations generally we attempt to match the duration of our investments with fixedrate financing 

we may structure transactions as master leases require operator or tenant insurance and indemnifications obtain enhancements in the form of guarantees letters of credit or security deposits and take other measures to mitigate risk we finance our investments based on our evaluation of available sources of funding for shortterm purposes we may utilize our revolving line of credit or arrange for other shortterm borrowings from banks or other sources we arrange for longerterm financing through offerings of securities placement of mortgage debt and capital from other institutional lenders and equity investors 

we specifically incorporate by reference into this section the information set forth in item 7 2008 transaction overview included elsewhere in this report 

competition 

investing in real estate is highly competitive we face competition from other reits investment companies private equity and hedge fund investors sovereign funds healthcare operators lenders developers and other institutional investors some of whom have greater resources and lower costs of capital than us increased competition makes it more challenging for us to identify and successfully capitalize on opportunities that meet our objectives our ability to compete is also impacted by national and local economic trends availability of investment alternatives availability and cost of capital construction and renovation costs existing laws and regulations new legislation and population trends 

rental income from our facilities is dependent on the ability of our operators and tenants to compete with other operators and tenants on a number of different levels including the quality of care provided reputation the physical appearance of a facility price and range of services offered alternatives for healthcare delivery the supply of competing properties physicians staff referral sources location the size and demographics of the population in the surrounding area and the financial condition of our tenants and operators private federal and state payment programs and the effect of laws and regulations may also have a significant influence on the profitability of our tenants and operators for a discussion of the risks associated with competitive conditions affecting our business see risk factors in item 1a 

healthcare property types 

senior housing at december 31 2008 we had interests in 264 senior housing facilities including 25 facilities owned by our investment management platform 1  senior housing facilities include independent living facilities ilfs assisted living facilities alfs and continuing care retirement communities ccrcs which cater to different segments of the elderly population based upon their needs services provided by our operators or tenants in these facilities are primarily paid for by the residents directly or through private insurance and are less reliant on government reimbursement programs such as medicaid and medicare our senior housing property types are further described below

taxation of hcp inc 

hcp inc believes that it has operated in such a manner as to qualify for taxation as a reit under sections 856 to 860 of the internal revenue code of 1986 as amended the code commencing with its taxable year ended december 31 1985 and it intends to continue to operate in such a manner no assurance can be given that hcp inc has operated or will be able to continue to operate in a manner so as to qualify or to remain so qualified for a description of the risks associated with hcp incs reit structure and the related tax provisions governing hcp inc see risk factors—tax and reitrelated risks in item 1a of this report this summary is qualified in its entirety by the applicable code provisions rules and regulations promulgated thereunder and administrative and judicial interpretations thereof 

if hcp inc qualifies for taxation as a reit it will generally not be required to pay federal corporate income taxes on the portion of its net income that is currently distributed to stockholders this treatment substantially eliminates the double taxation ie taxation at the corporate and stockholder levels that generally results from investment in a corporation however hcp inc will be required to pay federal income tax under certain circumstances 

the code defines a reit as a corporation trust or association which meets the following statutory requirements i it is managed by one or more trustees or directors ii its beneficial ownership is evidenced by transferable shares or by transferable certificates of beneficial interest iii it would be taxable as a domestic corporation but for sections 856 through 860 of the code iv it is neither a financial institution nor an insurance company subject to certain provisions of the code v its beneficial ownership is held by 100 or more persons vi during the last half of each taxable year 

not more than 50 in value of its outstanding stock is owned actually or constructively by five or fewer individuals and vii it meets certain other tests described below regarding the amount of its distributions and the nature of its income and assets the code provides that conditions i to iv inclusive must be met during the entire taxable year and that condition v must be met during at least 335 days of a taxable year of 12 months or during a proportionate part of a taxable year of less than 12 months in addition conditions v and vi do not apply in the first taxable year for which an election to be treated as a reit is effective 

at the close of each taxable year hcp inc must meet two gross income requirements first for each taxable year at least 75 of hcp incs gross income excluding gross income from prohibited transactions as defined below certain hedging transactions entered into after july 30 2008 and certain foreign currency gains recognized after july 30 2008 must be derived directly or indirectly from investments relating to real property including rents from real property or mortgages certain mezzanine loans or from certain types of temporary investment income second at least 95 of hcp incs gross income for each taxable year excluding gross income from prohibited transactions certain hedging transactions and certain foreign currency gains recognized after july 30 2008 must be derived from income that qualifies under the 75 test and other dividends interest and gain from the sale or other disposition of stock or securities a prohibited transaction is a sale or other disposition of property other than foreclosure property held for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business under newly enacted legislation after january 1 2009 rents received by hcp inc from the lease of certain healthcare properties to its taxable reit subsidiaries each a trs and collectively trss may qualify as rents for purposes of the gross income requirements if the property is operated on behalf of the trs by a person that is an independent contractor and certain other requirements are met 

at the close of each quarter of hcp incs taxable year it must also satisfy four tests relating to the nature of its assets first at least 75 of the value of hcp incs total assets must be represented by real estate assets including shares of stock of other reits cash cash items or government securities for purposes of this test the term real estate assets generally means real property including interests in real property and mortgages and certain mezzanine loans and shares in other reits as well as any stock or debt instrument attributable to the investment of the proceeds of a stock offering or a public debt offering with a term of at least five years but only for the oneyear period beginning on the date the proceeds are received second not more than 25 of hcp incs total assets may be represented by securities other than those in the 75 asset class third of the investments included in the 25 asset class and except for certain investments in other reits qualified reit subsidiaries and trss the value of any one issuers securities owned by hcp inc may not exceed 5 of the value of hcp incs total assets and hcp inc may not own more than 10 of the vote or value of the securities of any one issuer solely for purposes of the 10 value test however certain securities including but not limited to securities having specified characteristics straight debt loans to an individual or an estate obligations to pay rents from real property and securities issued by a reit are disregarded as securities fourth not more than 20 25 for taxable years beginning on or after january 1 2009 of the value of hcp incs total assets may be represented by securities of one or more trss 

hcp inc directly and indirectly owns interests in various partnerships and limited liability companies in the case of a reit that is a partner in a partnership or a member of a limited liability company that is treated as a partnership under the code for purposes of the reit asset and income tests the reit will be deemed to own its proportionate share of the assets of the partnership or limited liability company and will be deemed to be entitled to its proportionate share of gross income of the partnership or limited liability company in each case determined in accordance with the reits capital interest in the entity subject to special rules related to the 10 asset test the ownership of an interest in a partnership or limited liability company by a reit may involve special tax risks 

including the challenge by the internal revenue service of the allocations of income and expense items of the partnership or limited liability company which would affect the computation of taxable income of the reit and the status of the partnership or limited liability company as a partnership as opposed to an association taxable as a corporation for federal income tax purposes  

hcp inc also owns interests in a number of subsidiaries which are intended to be treated as qualified reit subsidiaries qrs a corporation will qualify as a qualified reit subsidiary of hcp inc if hcp inc owns 100 of the outstanding stock of the corporation directly or through other disregarded entities and hcp inc does not elect with the subsidiary to treat it as a taxable reit subsidiary or trs as described below a qrs is not treated as a separate corporation for federal income tax purposes and all assets liabilities and items of income deduction and credit of such subsidiaries will be treated as the assets liabilities and such items of hcp inc for purposes of the reit income and asset tests if any partnership limited liability company or qrs in which hcp inc owns an interest were treated as a corporation other than a trs or a reit for federal income tax purposes hcp inc could fail to satisfy the reit income and asset tests described above and could therefore fail to qualify as a reit unless certain relief provisions apply except with respect to certain entities in which hcp inc owns less than a 10 interest hcp inc believes that each of the partnerships limited liability companies and subsidiaries other than trss in which it owns an interest will be treated for tax purposes as a partnership disregarded entity in the case of a 100 owned partnership or limited liability company reit or qrs as applicable although no assurance can be given that the internal revenue service will not successfully challenge the status of any such entity 

as of december 31 2008 hcp inc and hcp life science reit inc hcp life science reit owned interests in 13 subsidiaries which have elected to be trss a reit may own any percentage of the voting stock and value of the securities of a corporation which jointly elects with the reit to be a trs provided certain requirements are met a trs generally may engage in any business including the provision of customary or noncustomary services to tenants of its parent reit and of others except a trs may not directly or indirectly manage or operate a lodging or healthcare facility or directly or indirectly provide to any other person under a franchise license or otherwise rights to any brand name under which any lodging or health care facility is operated a trs is treated as a regular corporation and is subject to federal income tax and applicable state income taxes at regular corporate rates in addition a 100 tax may be imposed on a reit if the arrangement between the reit or its tenants and its trs are not on arms length terms and as a result the reits rents or other income or the trss deductions are overstated 

in order to qualify as a reit hcp inc is required to distribute dividends other than capital gain dividends to its stockholders in an amount at least equal to a the sum of i 90 of its real estate investment trust taxable income computed without regard to the dividends paid deduction and its net capital gain and ii 90 of the net income if any after tax from foreclosure property minus b the sum of certain items of noncash income such distributions must be paid or treated as paid in the taxable year to which they relate at hcp incs election a distribution will be treated as paid in a taxable year if it is declared before hcp inc timely files its tax return for such year and is paid on or before the first regular dividend payment after such declaration provided such payment is made during the twelvemonth period following the close of such year to the extent that hcp inc does not distribute all of its net capital gain or distributes at least 90 but less than 100 of its real estate investment trust taxable income as adjusted hcp inc will be required to pay tax on the undistributed amount at regular corporate tax rates furthermore if hcp inc fails to distribute during each calendar year at least the sum of i 85 of its ordinary income for such year ii 95 of its capital gain net income for such year and iii any undistributed taxable income from prior periods hcp inc would be required to pay a 4 excise tax on the excess of such required distributions over the amounts actually distributed while historically hcp inc has satisfied the distribution requirements 

discussed above by making cash distributions to its shareholders a reit is permitted to satisfy these requirements by making distributions of cash or other property including in limited circumstances its own stock for distributions with respect to taxable years ending on or before december 31 2009 recent internal revenue service guidance allows us to satisfy up to 90 of the distribution requirements discussed above through the distribution of shares of hcp inc common stock if certain conditions are met 

on july 27 2007 we formed hcp life science reit inc hcp life science reit which elected to be taxed as a reit under sections 856 through 860 of the code commencing with its initial taxable year ended december 31 2007 we believe that hcp life science reit has operated in such a manner so as to qualify for taxation as a reit under the code commencing with its initial taxable year and hcp life science reit intends to continue to operate in such a manner provided that hcp life science reit qualifies as a reit hcp incs interest in hcp life science reit is treated as a qualifying real estate asset for purposes of the reit asset requirements and any dividend income or gains derived by hcp inc from the stock of hcp life science reit is generally treated as income that qualifies for purposes of the reit income requirements to qualify as a reit hcp life science reit must independently satisfy the various reit qualification requirements including distributions of reit taxable income if hcp life science reit were to fail to qualify as a reit it would be treated as a regular taxable corporation and its income would be subject to federal income tax in addition a failure of hcp life science reit to qualify as a reit could have an adverse effect on hcp incs ability to comply with the reit asset and income requirements described above and thus its ability to qualify as a reit 

if hcp inc or hcp life science reit fail to qualify for taxation as a reit in any taxable year and certain relief provisions do not apply the applicable reit will be required to pay tax including any applicable alternative minimum tax on its taxable income at regular corporate rates dividend distributions to stockholders in any year in which it fails to qualify will not be deductible by the applicable reit nor will such distributions be required to be made unless entitled to relief under specific statutory provisions the applicable reit will also be disqualified from taxation as a reit for the four taxable years following the year during which qualification was lost failure to qualify for even one year could substantially reduce distributions to stockholders and could result in us incurring substantial indebtedness to the extent borrowings are feasible or liquidating substantial investments in order to pay the resulting taxes 

in addition to federal income taxes hcp inc and hcp life science reit may be required to pay state and local taxes in various jurisdictions 

hcp inc and hcp life science reit may also be subject to certain other taxes applicable to reits including taxes in lieu of disqualification as a reit on undistributed income on income from prohibited transactions on net income from foreclosure property and on builtin gains from the sale of certain assets acquired from c corporations in taxfree transactions including the assets of slough estates usa inc seusa held by hcp life science reit during a specified time period 

government regulation licensing and enforcement 

overview 

our tenants and operators are typically subject to extensive and complex federal state and local healthcare laws and regulations relating to fraud and abuse practices government reimbursement licensure and certificate of need and similar laws governing the operation of healthcare facilities these regulations are wideranging and can subject our tenants and operators to civil criminal and administrative sanctions affected tenants and operators may find it increasingly difficult to comply with this complex and evolving regulatory regime because of a relative lack of guidance in many areas as certain of our healthcare properties are subject to oversight from several government agencies and the 

laws may vary from one jurisdiction to another changes in laws and regulations and reimbursement enforcement activity and regulatory noncompliance by our tenants and operators can all have a significant effect on their operations and financial condition which in turn may adversely impact us as detailed below and set forth under risk factors in item 1a 

we seek to mitigate the risk to us resulting from the significant healthcare regulatory risks faced by our tenants and operators by diversifying our portfolio among property types and geographical areas diversifying our tenant and operator base to limit our exposure to any single entity and seeking tenants and operators who are not primarily dependent on medicare or medicaid reimbursement for their revenues as of december 31 2008 our investments in the senior housing life science medical office skilled nursing and hospital segments represented approximately 36 28 18 10 and 8 of our portfolio respectively based on investment amount for the year ended december 31 2008 we estimate that approximately 8 and 24 of our tenants and operators revenues were derived from medicare and medicaid respectively based on information provided by our tenants and operators 

the following is a discussion of certain laws and regulations generally applicable to our operators and in certain cases to us as well as descriptions of some of the specific risks to which different types of our tenants and operators are subject 

fraud and abuse enforcement 

there are various extremely complex federal and state laws and regulations governing healthcare providers relationships and arrangements and prohibiting fraudulent and abusive practices by such providers these laws include i federal and state false claims acts which among other things prohibit providers from filing false claims or making false statements to receive payment from medicare medicaid or other federal or state healthcare programs ii federal and state antikickback and feesplitting statutes including the medicare and medicaid antikickback statute which prohibit the payment or receipt of remuneration to induce referrals or recommendations of healthcare items or services iii federal and state physician selfreferral laws commonly referred to as the stark law which generally prohibit referrals by physicians to entities with which the physician or an immediate family member has a financial relationship iv the federal civil monetary penalties law which prohibits among other things the knowing presentation of a false or fraudulent claims for certain healthcare services and v federal and state privacy laws including the privacy and security rules contained in the health insurance portability and accountability act of 1997 which provide for the privacy and security of personal health information violations of healthcare fraud and abuse laws carry civil criminal and administrative sanctions including punitive sanctions monetary penalties imprisonment denial of medicare and medicaid reimbursement and potential exclusion from medicare medicaid or other federal or state healthcare programs these laws are enforced by a variety of federal state and local agencies and can also be enforced by private litigants through among other things federal and state false claims acts which allow private litigants to bring qui tam or whistleblower actions many of our operators and tenants are subject to these laws and some of them may in the future become the subject of governmental enforcement actions if they fail to comply with applicable laws a violation of any of these federal and state fraud and abuse laws and regulations could negatively impact our tenants and operators liquidity financial condition and results of operations which could negatively impact their ability to make payments under their agreements with us or otherwise comply with the terms of such agreements 

reimbursement 

sources of revenue for many of our tenants and operators include among other sources governmental healthcare programs such as the federal medicare program and state medicaid programs and nongovernmental payors such as insurance carriers and health maintenance organizations as federal and state governments focus on healthcare reform initiatives and as many 

states face significant budget deficits efforts to reduce costs by these payors will likely continue which may result in reduced or slower growth in reimbursement for certain services provided by some of our tenants and operators in addition the failure of any of our tenants or operators to comply with various laws and regulations could jeopardize their certification and ability to continue to participate in federal and state healthcare programs including the medicare and medicaid programs 

healthcare licensure and certificate of need 

certain healthcare facilities in our portfolio are subject to extensive federal state and local licensure certification and inspection laws and regulations many states require certain healthcare providers to obtain a certificate of need which requires prior approval for the construction expansion and closure of certain healthcare facilities further various licenses and permits are required to dispense narcotics operate pharmacies handle radioactive materials and operate equipment failure to comply with any of these laws could result in loss of accreditation denial of reimbursement imposition of fines suspension or decertification from federal and state healthcare programs loss of license or closure of the facility the approval process related to state certificate of need laws may impact some of our tenants and operators abilities to expand or change their businesses failure to comply with these laws or to obtain required certificates of need may have an adverse effect on the operations and financial condition of the tenants and operators of properties owned by or mortgaged to us and therefore may adversely impact us 

life science facilities 

while certain of our life science tenants include some wellestablished companies other such tenants are less established and in some cases may not yet have a product approved by the food and drug administration or other regulatory authorities for commercial sale creating a new pharmaceutical product requires significant investments of time and money in part because of the extensive regulation of the healthcare industry it also entails considerable risk of failure in demonstrating that the product is safe and effective and in gaining regulatory approval and market acceptance further even after a life science company has gained regulatory approval to market a product the product still presents regulatory risks such risks may include among others the possible later discovery of safety concerns changes in reimbursement policies for the product competition from new products litigation over the validity or infringement of the underlying intellectual property and ultimately the expiration of patent protection for the product all these factors may have an adverse effect on the operations and financial condition of our life science tenants and therefore may adversely impact us 

senior housing entrance fee communities 

certain of the senior housing facilities mortgaged to or owned by us are operated as entrance fee communities generally an entrance fee is an upfront fee or consideration paid by a resident a portion of which may be refundable in exchange for some form of longterm benefit some of the entrance fee communities are subject to significant state regulatory oversight including for example oversight of each facilitys financial condition establishment and monitoring of reserve requirements and other financial restrictions the right of residents to cancel their contracts within a specified period of time lien rights in favor of the residents restrictions on change of ownership and similar matters such oversight and the rights of residents within these entrance fee communities may have an adverse effect on the operations and financial condition of our tenants and operators and therefore may adversely impact us 

americans with disabilities act the ada 

our properties must comply with the ada and any similar state or local laws to the extent that such properties are public accommodations as defined in those statutes the ada may require removal of barriers to access by persons with disabilities in certain public areas of our properties where such removal is readily achievable to date we have not received any notices of noncompliance with the ada that have caused us to incur substantial capital expenditures to address ada concerns should barriers to access by persons with disabilities be discovered at any of our properties we may be directly or indirectly responsible for additional costs that may be required to make facilities adacompliant noncompliance with the ada could result in the imposition of fines or an award of damages to private litigants the obligation to make readily achievable accommodations pursuant to the ada is an ongoing one and we continue to assess our properties and make modifications as appropriate in this respect 

environmental matters 

a wide variety of federal state and local environmental and occupational health and safety laws and regulations affect healthcare facility operations these complex federal and state statutes and their enforcement involve myriad regulations many of which involve strict liability on the part of the potential offender some of these federal and state statutes may directly impact us under various federal state and local environmental laws ordinances and regulations an owner of real property or a secured lender such as us may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of hazardous or toxic substances at under or disposed of in connection with such property as well as other potential costs relating to hazardous or toxic substances including government fines and damages for injuries to persons and adjacent property the cost of any required remediation removal fines or personal or property damages and the owners or secured lenders liability therefore could exceed or impair the value of the property andor the assets of the owner or secured lender in addition the presence of such substances or the failure to properly dispose of or remediate such substances may adversely affect the owners ability to sell or rent such property or to borrow using such property as collateral which in turn could reduce our revenues for a description of the risks associated with environmental matters see risk factors in item 1a of this report 




 item 1a risk factors 

  before deciding whether to invest in hcp you should carefully consider the risks described below as well as the risks described elsewhere in this report which risks are incorporated by reference into this section the risks and uncertainties described herein are not the only ones facing us and there may be additional risks that we do not presently know of or that we currently consider not likely to have a significant impact on us all of these risks could adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

as the owner of healthcare and other real estate facilities we are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties certain of these risks and uncertainties are associated directly with the business of owning and leasing real estate generally but others are associated with our specific business model or other attributes of hcp for example as described elsewhere in this report most of our properties are operated by andor leased to third parties accordingly adverse developments with respect to these third parties may materially adversely affect us in addition we operate in a manner intended to allow us to qualify as a reit which involves the application of highly technical and complex laws and regulations we believe that the risks facing our company generally fall into the following four categories 

• risks related to hcp • risks related to our operators and tenants 16 

• risks related to tax matters including reitrelated risks • risks related to our organizational structure risks related to hcp 

the recent market disruptions may materially adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 

the global financial markets are currently undergoing pervasive and fundamental disruptions the continuation or intensification of any such volatility may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations among other things the capital markets have recently experienced extreme pricing volatility dislocations and liquidity disruptions all of which have exerted downward pressure on stock prices widened credit spreads on prospective debt financing and led to unprecedented declines in the market values of us and foreign stock exchanges the recent dislocations in the debt markets have reduced the amount of capital that is available to finance real estate which in turn has led to reduced property values and caused an overall slowdown of real estate transaction activity all of which could negatively impact our operating results and financial condition 

the current us and global economic and financial crisis has also severely strained the credit markets resulting in the bankruptcies and mergers of large financial institutions and significant investment in and control by government bodies of financial institutions to avoid further illiquidity and bank failures at times certain segments of the credit market have frozen with banks no longer willing to make loans the continuation or intensification of current levels of market disruption and volatility could impact our ability to obtain new financing or refinance our existing debt as it becomes due 

the recent volatility may also lead to significant uncertainty in the valuation or in the stability of the value of our investments and those of our joint ventures that could result in a substantial decrease in the value of our properties and those of our joint ventures as a result we may not be able to recover the carrying amount of such investments and the associated goodwill if any which may require us to recognize an impairment charge in earnings additionally certain fees we generate from our joint ventures are dependent upon the value of the investments held by such joint ventures or the level of contributions we make to the property fund if property values or our level of contributions decrease certain fees generated by our joint ventures may also decrease 

we rely on external sources of capital to fund future capital needs and if our access to such capital is limited or on unfavorable terms we may not be able to meet commitments as they become due or make future investments necessary to grow our business 

in order to qualify as a reit under the code and to avoid the nondeductible excise tax we are generally required among other things to distribute to our stockholders each year at least 90 of our real estate investment trust taxable income computed without regard to the dividends paid deduction and net capital gains for distributions with respect to the taxable years ending on or before december 31 2009 recent internal revenue service guidance allows us to satisfy up to 90 of this requirement through the distribution of shares of hcp inc common stock if certain conditions are met we may not be able to fund from cash retained from operations all future capital needs including capital needs in connection with acquisitions and development activities if we are unable to obtain needed capital at all or only on unfavorable terms from these sources we might not be able to make the investments needed to grow our business and to meet our obligations and commitments as they mature as a result we rely on external sources of capital including debt and equity financing to fulfill our capital requirements our access to capital depends upon a number of factors some of which we have little or no control over including 

• further weakening of the us and global economies and the possibility of a prolonged recession 17 

• general availability of credit and market conditions including rising interest rates and increased borrowing cost • the market price of the shares of our equity securities • the markets perception of our growth potential and our current and potential future earnings and cash distributions • the ratings of our debt and preferred securities • our degree of financial leverage and operational flexibility • financial deterioration of our lenders that might impair their ability to meet their commitments to us or their willingness to make additional loans to us and our inability to replace the financing commitment of any such lender on favorable terms or at all • the stability in the market value of our properties • the value of our mezzanine loans and other debt investments • the financial performance of our operators tenants and borrowers • issues facing the healthcare industry including regulations and government reimbursement policies • changes in rules or practices governing our financial and sec reporting and • civil disturbances natural disasters or acts of war adverse changes in our credit ratings could impair our ability to obtain additional debt and preferred stock financing on favorable terms if at all and significantly reduce the market price of our securities including our common stock 

we currently have a credit rating of baa3 stable from moodys investors service moodys bbb stable from standard  poors ratings service sp and bbb positive from fitch ratings fitch on our senior unsecured debt securities and ba1 stable from moodys bb stable from sp and bbb positive from fitch on our preferred equity securities the credit ratings of our senior unsecured debt and preferred equity securities are based on our operating performance liquidity and leverage ratios overall financial position and other factors employed by the credit rating agencies in their rating analyses of us our credit ratings can affect the amount and type of capital we can access as well as the terms of any financings we may obtain there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain our current credit ratings and in the event that our current credit ratings deteriorate we would likely incur higher borrowing costs and it may be more difficult or expensive to obtain additional financing or refinance existing obligations and commitments also a downgrade in our credit ratings would trigger additional costs or other potentially negative consequences under our current and future credit facilities and debt instruments because we depend on external sources of capital to fund our acquisition and development activities adverse changes to our credit ratings could negatively impact our acquisition and development activities future growth opportunities financial condition and the market price of our securities 

our level of indebtedness could materially adversely affect us in many ways including reducing funds available for other business purposes and reducing our operational flexibility 

our indebtedness as of december 31 2008 was approximately 59 billion we may incur additional indebtedness in the future including in connection with the development or acquisition of assets which may be substantial any significant additional indebtedness could negatively affect the credit ratings of our debt and preferred equity securities and require a substantial portion of our cash 

flow to make interest and principal payments due on our indebtedness greater demands on our cash resources may reduce funds available to us to pay dividends conduct development activities make capital expenditures and acquisitions or carry out other aspects of our business strategy increased indebtedness can also limit our ability to adjust rapidly to changing market conditions make us more vulnerable to general adverse economic and industry conditions and create competitive disadvantages for us compared to other companies with relatively lower debt levels increased future debt service obligations may limit our operational flexibility including our ability to finance or refinance our properties contribute properties to joint ventures or sell properties as needed further if we are unable to meet our mortgage payments then the encumbered properties could be foreclosed upon or transferred to the mortgagee with a consequent loss of income and asset value a foreclosure on one or more of our properties could materially adversely affect our business results of operations financial condition and ability to pay dividends on our common and preferred equity securities 

covenants in our existing and future credit agreements and other debt instruments limit our operational flexibility and a covenant breach or a default could materially adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

the terms of our credit agreements and other indebtedness including additional credit agreements or amendments we may enter into and other indebtedness we may incur in the future require or will require us to comply with a number of customary financial and other covenants such as maintaining debt service coverage leverage ratios and tangible net worth requirements our continued ability to incur indebtedness and operate in general is subject to compliance with these financial and other covenants which limit our operational flexibility for example mortgages on our properties contain customary covenants such as those that limit or restrict our ability without the consent of the lender to further encumber or sell the applicable properties or to replace the applicable tenant or operator breaches of such covenants may result in defaults under certain mortgages on our properties even if we satisfy our payment obligations to the respective lender defaults under the mortgages including certain tenant or operator bankruptcies and other lease defaults may result in crossdefaults under and acceleration of certain of our other indebtedness covenants that limit our operational flexibility as well as defaults under our debt instruments could materially adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

an increase in interest rates would increase our interest costs on existing variable rate debt and new debt and could adversely impact our ability to refinance existing debt sell assets and limit our acquisition and development activities 

at december 31 2008 we had approximately 892 million of variable interest rate indebtedness which constitutes 15 of our overall indebtedness this variable rate debt had a weighted average interest rate of approximately 257 per annum we may incur more variable interest rate indebtedness in the future if interest rates increase so will our interest costs for our existing variable interest rate debt and any new debt this increased cost could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations decrease our ability to pay principal and interest on our debt decrease our ability to make distributions to our security holders and make the financing of any acquisition and development activity more costly further rising interest rates could limit our ability to refinance existing debt when it matures or cause us to pay higher interest rates upon refinancing and increase interest expense on refinanced indebtedness in addition an increase in interest rates could decrease the amount third parties are willing to pay for our assets thereby limiting our ability to reposition our portfolio promptly in response to changes in economic or other conditions at december 31 2008 our exposure to variable rate indebtedness is mitigated by 11 billion of variable rate investments 

unfavorable resolution of pending and future litigation matters and disputes could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition 

from time to time we may be directly involved in a number of legal proceedings lawsuits and other claims see legal proceedings in part i item 3 in this report for a discussion of certain legal proceedings in which we are involved we may also be named as defendants in lawsuits allegedly arising out of actions of our operators and tenants in which such operators and tenants have agreed to indemnify defend and hold us harmless from and against various claims litigation and liabilities arising in connection with their respective businesses see risks related to our operators and tenants— our operators and tenants are faced with litigation and rising liability and insurance costs that may affect their ability to make their lease or mortgage payments  an unfavorable resolution of pending or future litigation may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operations regardless of its outcome litigation may result in substantial costs and expenses and significantly divert the attention of management there can be no assurance that we will be able to prevail in or achieve a favorable settlement of pending or future litigation in addition pending litigation or future litigation government proceedings or environmental matters could lead to increased costs or interruption of our normal business operations 

a small number of operators and tenants some of whom are experiencing significant legal financial and regulatory difficulties account for a large percentage of our revenues 

during the year ended december 31 2008 approximately 37 of our portfolio based on our total revenues was operated or leased by five companies consisting of sunrise 15 hca 7 brookdale 7 genentech 4 and tenet 4 in addition during the year ended december 31 2008 we earned interest of 84 million and 24 million in connection with mezzanine loans to hcr manorcare and marketable debt securities issued by hca respectively certain of these companies are experiencing significant legal financial and regulatory difficulties among other things sunrise has disclosed that it does not anticipate being in compliance with certain financial covenants in its bank credit facility as of march 31 2009 which could result in an acceleration of the debt under that facility in addition several of these major operators and tenants have significant debt and lease obligations and have been affected by the recent economic downturn which has led to in some instances a precipitous decline in their stock price the failure or inability of any of these operators or tenants to meet their obligations to us could materially reduce our cash flow as well as our results of operations which could in turn reduce the amount of dividends we pay cause our stock price to decline and have other material adverse effects see risks related to our operators and tenants— the bankruptcy insolvency or financial deterioration of one or more of our major operators or tenants may materially adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition  for additional information on the risks we face from a failure of one or more of our operators or tenants 

we have investments in mezzanine loans which are subject to a greater risk of loss than loans secured by the underlying real estate 

at december 31 2008 we had mezzanine loan investments with a carrying value of 918 million our mezzanine loans generally take the form of subordinated loans secured by a pledge of ownership interests in either the entity owning the property or a pledge of the ownership interests in the entity that owns directly or through other entities the interest in the entities owning the properties these types of investments involve a higher degree of risk than longterm senior mortgage loans secured by income producing real property because the investment may have a lesser likelihood of being repaid in full as a result of foreclosure by the senior lender in the event of a bankruptcy of the entity providing the pledge of its ownership interests as security we may not have full recourse to the assets of such entity or the assets of the entity may not be sufficient to fully repay our mezzanine loans if a borrower defaults on our mezzanine loans or debt senior to our loans or in the event of a borrower 

bankruptcy our mezzanine loans will be satisfied only after the senior debt is paid and consistent with bankruptcy rules as a result we may not recover some or all of our investment in addition mezzanine loans may have higher loantovalue ratios than conventional mortgage loans resulting in less equity in the property and increasing the risk of loss of principal if our mezzanine loans are not repaid or are only partially repaid our business results of operations and financial condition may be materially adversely affected 

we may be unable to successfully foreclose on the collateral securing our real estaterelated loans and even if we are successful in our foreclosure efforts we may be unable to successfully operate or occupy the underlying real estate which may adversely affect our ability to recover our investments 

if an operator or tenant defaults under one of our mortgages or mezzanine loans we may have to foreclose on the loan or protect our interest by acquiring title to the collateral in some cases as noted above the collateral consists of the equity interests in an entity that directly or indirectly owns the applicable real property and accordingly we may not have full recourse to assets of that entity in addition if we acquire real estate as a result of a foreclosure we may be required to make substantial improvements or repairs in order to maximize the facilitys investment potential operators tenants or borrowers may contest enforcement of foreclosure or other remedies seek bankruptcy protection against our exercise of enforcement or other remedies andor bring claims for lender liability in response to actions to enforce mortgage obligations foreclosurerelated costs high loantovalue ratios or declines in the value of the facility may prevent us from realizing an amount equal to our mortgage or mezzanine loan upon foreclosure even if we are able to successfully foreclose on the collateral securing our real estaterelated loans we may inherit properties for which we are unable to expeditiously seek tenants or operators if at all which would adversely affect our ability to fully recover our investment 

credit enhancements to our leases may terminate or be inadequate or the provider of a credit enhancement may be unable to fulfill its payment obligations to us any of which may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

some of our leases have credit enhancement provisions in the form of guarantees or security deposits for minimum rent payments payable to us these credit enhancement provisions may terminate at either a specific time during the lease term or once the property satisfies defined operating hurdles like net operating income these provisions may also have limits on the overall amount of the credit enhancement after the termination of a credit enhancement or in the event that the maximum limit of a credit enhancement is reached we may only look to the tenant or operator to make lease payments some of our tenants are thinly capitalized entities that rely on the results of operations generated by the properties to fund rent obligations under their lease in the event that a credit enhancement has expired or the maximum limit has been reached or in the event that a provider of a credit enhancement is unable to meet its payment obligations our results of operations and cash available for distribution could be materially adversely affected if our properties are unable to generate sufficient funds from operations to meet minimum rent payments and the tenants or operators do not otherwise have the resources to make those rent payments 

required regulatory approvals can delay or prohibit transfers of our healthcare facilities 

transfers of healthcare facilities to successor tenants or operators may be subject to regulatory approvals including change of ownership approvals under certificate of need laws and medicare and medicaid provider arrangements that are not required for transfers of other types of commercial operations and other types of real estate the replacement of any tenant or operator could be delayed by the regulatory approval process of any federal state or local government agency necessary for the transfer of the facility or the replacement of the operator licensed to manage the facility if we are 

unable to find a suitable replacement tenant or operator upon favorable terms or at all we may take possession of a facility which might expose us to successor liability or require us to indemnify subsequent operators to whom we might transfer the operating rights and licenses all of which may adversely affect our revenues and operations 

we may not be able to sell properties when we desire because real estate investments are relatively illiquid 

real estate investments generally cannot be sold quickly in addition some of our properties serve as collateral for our secured debt obligations and cannot be readily sold we may not be able to vary our portfolio promptly in response to changes in the real estate market this inability to respond to changes in the performance of our investments could adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition and in particular our ability to service our debt and pay dividends on our common and preferred stock the real estate market is affected by many factors that are beyond our control including 

• adverse changes in national and local economic and market conditions • changes in interest rates and in the availability costs and terms of financing • leases or management agreements which are not renewed or are renewed at lower payment amounts at expiration • the exercise of purchase options by operators or tenants resulting in a reduction of our revenues • changes in laws regulations fiscal policies zoning and other ordinances • the costs of complying with existing and new laws and regulations • the ongoing need for capital improvements particularly in older structures and the need to make expenditures due to changes in governmental regulations including the ada • environmental hazards created by prior owners or occupants existing operators or tenants borrowers or other persons for which we may be liable • changes in operating expenses and • acts of terrorism civil unrest acts of war and natural disasters including earthquakes and floods which may result in uninsured and underinsured losses we cannot predict whether we will be able to sell any property for the price or on the terms set by us or whether any price or other terms offered by a prospective purchaser would be acceptable to us we also cannot predict the length of time needed to find a willing purchaser and to close the sale of a property or portfolio of properties in addition there are provisions under the federal income tax laws applicable to reits that may limit our ability to recognize the full economic benefit from a sale of our assets these factors and any others that would impede our ability to respond to adverse changes in the performance of our properties could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

real estate is a competitive business and this competition may make it difficult to identify and purchase or develop suitable healthcare and other facilities to grow our operations through these activities or to successfully reinvest proceeds 

we operate in a highly competitive industry part of our business strategy is growing through acquisitions which requires us to identify suitable candidates that meet our acquisition criteria however when we attempt to develop finance or acquire properties we face competition from other reits investment companies private equity and hedge fund investors sovereign funds healthcare operators lenders developers and other institutional investors some of whom have greater resources 

and lower costs of capital than us increased competition makes it more challenging for us to identify and successfully capitalize on opportunities that meet our business goals among other things from time to time we have cash proceeds available to us from securities offerings asset sales joint venture or other activities in which competition can negatively affect our ability to reinvest these proceeds on a timely basis if we cannot capitalize on our development pipeline identify and purchase a sufficient quantity of healthcare facilities at favorable prices or reinvest proceeds on a timely basis or if we are unable to finance acquisitions on commercially favorable terms our business results of operations and financial condition may be materially adversely affected 

because of the unique and specific improvements required for healthcare facilities we may be required to incur substantial development and renovation costs to make certain of our properties suitable for other operators and tenants which could materially adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

healthcare facilities are typically highly customized and may not be easily adapted to nonhealthcarerelated uses the improvements generally required to conform a property to healthcare use such as upgrading electrical gas and plumbing infrastructure are costly and often times tenantspecific a new or replacement operator or tenant may require different features in a property depending on that operators or tenants particular operations if a current operator or tenant is unable to pay rent and vacates a property we may incur substantial expenditures to modify a property before we are able to secure another operator or tenant also if the property needs to be renovated to accommodate multiple operators or tenants we may incur substantial expenditures before we are able to release the space these expenditures or renovations may materially adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

we face additional risks associated with property development that can render a project less profitable or not at all and under certain circumstances prevent completion of development activities once undertaken all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

largescale groundup development of healthcare properties presents additional risks for us including risks that 

• a development opportunity may be abandoned after expending significant resources resulting in the loss of deposits or failure to recover expenses already incurred • the development and construction costs of a project may exceed original estimates due to increased interest rates and higher materials transportation labor leasing or other costs which could make the completion of the development project less profitable • construction andor permanent financing may not be available on favorable terms or at all • the project may not be completed on schedule which can result in increases in construction costs and debt service expenses as a result of a variety of factors that are beyond our control including natural disasters labor conditions material shortages regulatory hurdles civil unrest and acts of war and • occupancy rates and rents at a newly completed property may not meet expected levels and could be insufficient to make the property profitable properties developed or acquired for development likely generate little or no cash flow from the date of acquisition through the date of completion of development in addition new development activities regardless of whether or not they are ultimately successful may require a substantial portion of our managements time and attention 

these risks could result in substantial unanticipated delays or expenses and under certain circumstances could prevent completion of development activities once undertaken any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition and thus our ability to satisfy our debt service obligations and to pay dividends to stockholders 

our use of joint ventures may limit our flexibility with jointly owned investments and could adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

we intend to develop andor acquire properties in joint ventures with other persons or entities when circumstances warrant the use of these structures our participation in joint ventures is subject to risks that 

• we could experience an impasse on certain decisions because we do not have sole decisionmaking authority which could require us to expend additional resources on resolving such impasses or potential disputes • our joint venture partners could have investment goals that are not consistent with our investment objectives including the timing terms and strategies for any investments • our joint venture partners might become bankrupt fail to fund their share of required capital contributions or fail to fulfill their obligations as a joint venture partner which may require us to infuse our own capital into the venture on behalf of the partner despite other competing uses for such capital and • our joint venture partners may have competing interests in our markets that could create conflict of interest issues from time to time we acquire other companies and need to integrate them into our existing business if we are unable to successfully integrate the operations of acquired companies or they fail to perform as expected our business results of operations and financial condition may be materially adversely affected 

acquisitions require the integration of companies that have previously operated independently successful integration of the operations of these companies depends primarily on our ability to consolidate operations systems procedures properties and personnel and to eliminate redundancies and costs we cannot assure you that we will be able to integrate the operations of the companies that we have acquired or may acquire in the future without encountering difficulties potential difficulties associated with acquisitions include the loss of key employees the disruption of our ongoing business or that of the acquired entity possible inconsistencies in standards controls procedures and policies and the assumption of unexpected liabilities estimated cost savings in connection with acquisitions are typically projected to come from various areas that our management identifies through the due diligence and integration planning process yet our target companies and their properties may fail to perform as expected inaccurate assumptions regarding future rental or occupancy rates could result in overly optimistic estimates of future revenues similarly we may underestimate future operating expenses or the costs necessary to bring properties up to standards established for their intended use or market position if we have difficulties with any of these areas or if we later discover additional liabilities or experience unforeseen costs relating to our acquired companies we might not achieve the economic benefits we expect from our acquisitions and this may materially adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

failure to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition and stock price 

pursuant to the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 we are required to provide a report by management on internal control over financial reporting including managements assessment of the effectiveness of 

such control changes to our business will necessitate ongoing changes to our internal control systems and processes internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements because of its inherent limitations including the possibility of human error the circumvention or overriding of controls or fraud therefore even effective internal controls can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements if we fail to maintain the adequacy of our internal controls including any failure to implement required new or improved controls or if we experience difficulties in their implementation our business results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely harmed we could fail to meet our reporting obligations and there could be a material adverse effect on our stock price 

loss of our key personnel could temporarily disrupt our operations and adversely affect us 

we are dependent on the efforts of our executive officers although our chief executive officer has an employment agreement with us we cannot assure you that he will remain employed with us the loss or limited availability of the services of our chief executive officer or any of our executive officers or our inability to recruit and retain qualified personnel in the future could at least temporarily have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations and be negatively perceived in the capital markets 

we may experience uninsured or underinsured losses which could result in the loss of all or a portion of the capital we have invested in a property or decrease anticipated future revenues 

we maintain comprehensive insurance coverage on our properties with terms conditions limits and deductibles that we believe are adequate and appropriate given the relative risk and costs of such coverage however a large number of our properties are located in areas exposed to earthquake windstorm and flood and may be subject to other losses in particular our life science portfolio is concentrated in areas known to be subject to earthquake activity while we purchase insurance for earthquake windstorm and flood that we believe is adequate in light of current industry practice and analysis prepared by outside consultants there is no assurance that such insurance will fully cover such losses these losses can decrease our anticipated revenues from a property and result in the loss of all or a portion of the capital we have invested in a property the insurance market for such exposures can be very volatile and we may be unable to purchase the limits and terms we desire on a commercially reasonable basis in the future in addition there are certain exposures where insurance is not purchased as we do not believe it is economically feasible to do so 

environmental compliance costs and liabilities associated with our real estate related investments may materially impair the value of those investments 

under various federal state and local laws ordinances and regulations as a current or previous owner of real estate we may be required to investigate and clean up certain hazardous substances released at a property and may be held liable to a governmental entity or to third parties for property damage and for investigation and cleanup costs incurred by the third parties in connection with the contamination in addition some environmental laws create a lien on the contaminated site in favor of the government for damages and the costs it incurs in connection with the contamination although we i currently carry environmental insurance on our properties in an amount and subject to deductibles that we believe are commercially reasonable and ii generally require our operators and tenants to undertake to indemnify us for environmental liabilities they cause such liabilities could exceed the amount of our insurance the financial ability of the tenant or operator to indemnify us or the value of the contaminated property the presence of contamination or the failure to remediate contamination may adversely affect our ability to sell or lease real estate or to borrow using the real estate as collateral as the owner of a site we may also be liable under common law to third parties for 

damages and injuries resulting from environmental contamination emanating from the site we may also experience environmental liabilities arising from conditions not known to us 

risks related to our operators and tenants 

the bankruptcy insolvency or financial deterioration of one or more of our major operators or tenants may materially adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

we lease our properties directly to operators in most cases and in certain other cases we lease to thirdparty tenants who enter into longterm management agreements with operators to manage the properties although our leases financing arrangements and other agreements with our tenants and operators generally provide us the right under specified circumstances to terminate a lease evict an operator or tenant or demand immediate repayment of certain obligations to us the bankruptcy laws afford certain rights to a party that has filed for bankruptcy or reorganization that may render certain of these remedies unenforceable or at the least delay our ability to pursue such remedies for example we cannot evict a tenant or operator solely because of its bankruptcy filing a debtor has the right to assume or to assume and assign to a third party or reject its unexpired contracts in a bankruptcy proceeding if a debtor were to reject its leases with us our claim against the debtor for unpaid and future rents would be limited by the statutory cap set forth in the us bankruptcy code which may be substantially less than the remaining rent actually owed under the lease in addition the inability of our tenants or operators to make payments or comply with certain other lease obligations may affect our compliance with certain covenants contained in the mortgages on the properties leased or managed by such tenants and operators moreover certain tenant or operator bankruptcies or other lease defaults may result in defaults under the mortgages on the relevant properties and crossdefaults under and acceleration of our other indebtedness although we believe that we would be able to secure amendments under the applicable agreements if a default as described above occurs such default may potentially result in less favorable borrowing terms than currently available delays in the availability of funding or other material adverse consequences 

many of our operating leases also contain noncontingent rent escalators for which we recognize income on a straightline basis over the lease term this method results in rental income in the early years of a lease being higher than actual cash received creating a straightline rent receivable asset included in the caption other assets net on our consolidated balance sheets at some point during the lease depending on its terms the cash rent payments eventually exceed the straightline rent which results in the straightline rent receivable asset decreasing to zero over the remainder of the lease term we assess the collectibility of the straightline rent that is expected to be collected in a future period and depending on circumstances we may provide a reserve against the previously recognized straightline rent receivable asset for a portion up to its full value that we estimate may not be recoverable in addition upon acquisition of a leased property that we account for as an operating lease we may record leaserelated intangible assets to the extent the purchase price for the asset exceeds its fair market value the balance of straightline rent receivable at december 31 2008 net of allowances was 112 million we had approximately 465 million of leaserelated intangible assets net of amortization and 231 million of leaserelated intangible liabilities net of amortization associated with our operating leases at december 31 2008 to the extent any of the operators or tenants for our properties for the reasons discussed above become unable to pay amounts due we may be required to write down the straightline rents receivable or lease intangibles or may impair the related carrying value of leased properties 

the current us housing and strained credit markets may adversely affect our operators and tenants ability to increase or maintain occupancy levels at and rental income from our senior housing facilities 

our tenants and operators may have relatively flat or declining occupancy levels in the nearterm due to falling home prices declining incomes stagnant home sales and other economic factors seniors 

may choose to postpone their plans to move into senior housing facilities rather than sell their homes at a loss or for a profit below their expectations moreover tightening lending standards and the strained credit market have made it more difficult for potential buyers to obtain mortgage financing all of which have contributed to the declining home sales in addition the senior housing segment may experience a decline in occupancy associated with private pay residents choosing to move out of the facilities to be cared for at home by relatives due to the weakening economy a material decline in our tenants and operators occupancy levels and revenues may make it more difficult for them to meet their financial obligations to us which could materially adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

operators and tenants that fail to comply with the requirements of governmental reimbursement programs such as medicare or medicaid licensing and certification requirements fraud and abuse regulations or new legislative developments may cease to operate or be unable to meet their financial and contractual obligations to us 

our operators and tenants are subject to numerous federal state and local laws and regulations that are subject to frequent and substantial changes sometimes applied retroactively resulting from legislation adoption of rules and regulations and administrative and judicial interpretations of existing law the ultimate timing or effect of these changes cannot be predicted these changes may have a dramatic effect on our operators and tenants costs of doing business and on the amount of reimbursement by both government and other thirdparty payors the failure of any of our operators or tenants to comply with these laws requirements and regulations could adversely affect their ability to meet their financial and contractual obligations to us regulations that affect our operators and tenants include the following 

• fraud and abuse laws and regulations there are various extremely complex federal and state laws and regulations governing healthcare providers relationships and arrangements and prohibiting fraudulent and abusive practices by such providers these laws include i federal and state false claims acts which among other things prohibit providers from filing false claims or making false statements to receive payment from medicare medicaid or other federal or state healthcare programs ii federal and state antikickback and feesplitting statutes including the medicare and medicaid antikickback statute which prohibit the payment or receipt of remuneration to induce referrals or recommendations of healthcare items or services iii federal and state physician selfreferral laws including the stark law which generally prohibit referrals by physicians to entities with which the physician or an immediate family member has a financial relationship iv the federal civil monetary penalties law which prohibits among other things the knowing presentation of a false or fraudulent claims for certain healthcare services and v federal and state privacy laws including the privacy and security rules contained in the health insurance portability and accountability act of 1997 which provide for the privacy and security of personal health information furthermore violations of healthcare fraud and abuse laws can carry substantial civil criminal or administrative sanctions including potential exclusion or debarment from medicare medicaid or other federal or state health care programs these laws are enforced by a variety of federal state and local agencies and can also be enforced by private litigants through among other things federal and state false claims acts which allow private litigants to bring qui tam or whistleblower actions 

• medicare and medicaid during 2008 our skilled nursing segment accounted for approximately 4 of our revenues a portion of our skilled nursing operators revenues is derived from governmentallyfunded reimbursement programs primarily medicare and medicaid and are consequently subject to the potential adverse effects of decreased reimbursement rates in these programs as federal and state governments focus on healthcare reform initiatives and as many 27 

states face significant budget deficits efforts to reduce costs by these payors will likely continue which may result in reduced or slower growth in reimbursement for certain services provided by some of our tenants and operators in addition the failure of any of our tenants or operators to comply with various laws and regulations could jeopardize their certification and ability to continue to participate in federal and state healthcare programs including the medicare and medicaid programs exclusion from the medicare and medicaid programs could cause the revenues of our operators and borrowers to decline potentially jeopardizing their ability to meet their obligations to us causing the value of our affected properties or investments to decline 

state licensing and medicare and medicaid laws also require operators of nursing homes and alfs to comply with extensive standards governing operations federal and state agencies administering those laws regularly inspect such facilities and investigate complaints our operators borrowers and their managers receive notices of potential sanctions and remedies from time to time and such sanctions have been imposed from time to time on facilities operated by them if they are unable to cure deficiencies sanctions may be imposed that reduce our operators and borrowers revenues or cause them to cease operations thereby potentially jeopardizing their ability to meet their obligations to us 

• licensing and certification certain healthcare facilities in our portfolio are subject to extensive federal state and local licensure certification and inspection laws and regulations these facilities are audited periodically by federal state and local authorities to confirm compliance further various licenses and permits are required to dispense narcotics operate pharmacies handle radioactive materials and operate equipment finally many states require certain healthcare providers to obtain a certificate of need prior to the construction expansion or closure of certain healthcare facilities our skilled nursing facilities in particular tend to require certificates of need prior to the addition or construction of new beds the addition of services or certain capital expenditures some of our facilities may be unable to satisfy current and future certificate of need requirements and may for this reason be unable to continue operating in the future in such event our revenues from those facilities could be reduced or eliminated for an extended period of time or permanently furthermore failure to comply with any of these laws could result in loss of accreditation denial of reimbursement imposition of fines suspension or decertification from federal and state healthcare programs loss of license or closure of the facility • legislative and regulatory developments each year legislative proposals are introduced or proposed in congress and in some state legislatures that would affect major changes in the healthcare system either nationally or at the state level we cannot accurately predict whether any proposals will be adopted or if adopted what effect if any these proposals would have on our operators and tenants and thus our business increased competition as well as increased operating costs have resulted in lower net revenues for some of our operators and tenants and may affect their ability to meet their financial and other contractual obligations to us 

the healthcare industry is highly competitive and can become more competitive in the future the occupancy levels at and rental income from our facilities is dependent on the ability of our operators and tenants to compete with entities that have substantial capital resources these entities compete with other operators and tenants on a number of different levels including the quality of care provided reputation the physical appearance of a facility price the range of services offered family preference alternatives for healthcare delivery the supply of competing properties physicians staff referral sources location and the size and demographics of the population in the surrounding area private federal and state payment programs and the effect of laws and regulations may also have a significant influence on the profitability of our tenants and operators our operators and tenants also 

compete with numerous other companies providing similar healthcare services or alternatives such as home health agencies life care at home communitybased service programs retirement communities and convalescent centers such competition which has intensified due to overbuilding in some segments in which we invest has caused the fillup rate of newly constructed buildings to slow and the monthly rate that many newly built and previously existing facilities were able to obtain for their services to decrease we cannot be certain that the operators and tenants of all of our facilities will be able to achieve occupancy and rate levels that will enable them to meet all of their obligations to us further many competing companies may have resources and attributes that are superior to those of our operators and tenants thus our operators and tenants may encounter increased competition in the future that could limit their ability to attract residents or expand their businesses which could materially adversely affect their ability meet their financial and other contractual obligation to us potentially decreasing our revenues and increasing our collection and dispute costs 

our operators and tenants may not procure the necessary insurance to adequately insure against losses 

our leases generally require our tenants and operators to secure and maintain comprehensive liability and property insurance that covers us as well as the tenants and operators some types of losses may not be adequately insured by our tenants and operators should an uninsured loss or a loss in excess of insured limits occur we could incur liability or lose all or a portion of the capital we have invested in a property as well as the anticipated future revenues from the property in such an event we might nevertheless remain obligated for any mortgage debt or other financial obligations related to the property we continually review the insurance maintained by our tenants and operators however we cannot assure you that material uninsured losses or losses in excess of insurance proceeds will not occur in the future 

our operators and tenants are faced with litigation and rising liability and insurance costs that may affect their ability to make their lease or mortgage payments 

in some states advocacy groups have been created to monitor the quality of care at healthcare facilities and these groups have brought litigation against the operators and tenants of such facilities also in several instances private litigation by patients has succeeded in winning very large damage awards for alleged abuses the effect of this litigation and potential litigation has been to materially increase the costs incurred by our operators and tenants for monitoring and reporting quality of care compliance in addition their cost of liability and medical malpractice insurance can be very significant and may increase so long as the present healthcare litigation environment continues cost increases could cause our operators to be unable to make their lease or mortgage payments or fail to purchase the appropriate liability and malpractice insurance potentially decreasing our revenues and increasing our collection and litigation costs moreover to the extent we are required to take back the affected facilities from our operators and tenants our revenues from those facilities could be reduced or eliminated for an extended period of time in addition as a result of our ownership of healthcare facilities we may be named as a defendant in lawsuits allegedly arising from the actions of our operators or tenants which may require unanticipated expenditures on our part 

our tenants in the life science industry face high levels of regulation expense and uncertainty that may adversely affect their ability to make payments to us and consequently materially adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

life science tenants particularly those involved in developing and marketing pharmaceutical products are subject to certain unique risks as follows 

• some of our tenants require significant outlays of funds for the research development and clinical testing of their products and technologies if private investors the government or other 29 

sources of funding are unavailable to support such activities a tenants business may be adversely affected or fail 

• the research development clinical testing manufacture and marketing of some of our tenants products require federal state and foreign regulatory approvals the approval process is typically long expensive and uncertain even if our tenants have sufficient funds to seek approvals one or all of their products may fail to obtain the required regulatory approvals on a timely basis or at all furthermore some tenants may only have a small number of products under development if one product fails to receive the required approvals at any stage of development it could significantly adversely affect our tenants entire business and its ability to make payments to us • even after a life science tenant gains regulatory approval and market acceptance the product still presents regulatory and liability risks such risks may include among others the possible later discovery of safety concerns competition from new products and ultimately the expiration of patent protection for the product these factors may have an adverse effect on the operations and financial condition of our life science tenants and therefore may adversely impact us • our tenants with marketable products may be adversely affected by healthcare reform efforts and the reimbursement policies of government or private healthcare payors • our tenants may be unable to adequately protect their intellectual property under patent copyright or trade secret laws failure to do so could jeopardize their ability to profit from their efforts and to protect their products from competition we cannot assure you that our life science tenants will be successful in their businesses if our tenants businesses are adversely affected they may have difficulty making payments to us which could materially adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

tax and reitrelated risks 

loss of hcp incs tax status as a reit would substantially reduce our available funds and would have material adverse consequences to us 

hcp inc currently operates and has operated commencing with its taxable year ended december 31 1985 in a manner that is intended to allow it to qualify as a reit for federal income tax purposes under the code in addition as described below we own the stock of hcp life science reit which elected to be treated as a reit commencing with its initial taxable year ended december 31 2007 

qualification as a reit involves the application of highly technical and complex code provisions for which there are only limited judicial and administrative interpretations the determination of various factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control may affect the ability of hcp inc and hcp life science reit to qualify as reits if hcp life science reit were to fail to qualify as a reit hcp inc also would fail to qualify as a reit unless hcp inc or hcp life science reit could make use of certain relief provisions provided under the code to qualify as reits hcp inc and hcp life science reit must each satisfy a number of organizational operational stockholder ownership dividend distribution asset income and other requirements for example to qualify as a reit at least 95 of hcp incs gross income in any year must be derived from qualifying sources and hcp inc must make distributions to its stockholders aggregating annually at least 90 of its reit taxable income excluding net capital gains in addition new legislation treasury regulations administrative interpretations or court decisions may adversely affect our investors if such future events affected hcp incs ability to qualify as a reit for tax purposes although we believe that hcp inc and hcp life science reit have been organized and have operated in such manner we can give no assurance that hcp inc or hcp life science reit have qualified or will continue to qualify as a reit for tax purposes 

if hcp inc loses its reit status we will face serious tax consequences that will substantially reduce the funds available to make payments of principal and interest on the debt securities we issue and to make distributions to stockholders if hcp inc fails to qualify as a reit 

• it would not be allowed an income tax deduction for dividends distributed to stockholders and would be subject to federal and state income tax at regular corporate rates or alternative minimum tax rates • it could also be subject to increased local income taxes and • unless hcp inc is entitled to relief under statutory provisions it could not elect to be subject to tax as a reit for four taxable years following the year for which it was disqualified in addition if hcp inc fails to qualify as a reit it would not be required to make distributions to stockholders however all distributions to stockholders would be subject to tax as qualifying corporate dividends to the extent of hcp incs current and accumulated earnings and profits 

as a result of all these factors hcp incs failure to qualify as a reit also could impair our ability to expand our business and raise capital and could materially adversely affect the value of our common stock 

certain property transfers may generate prohibited transaction income resulting in a penalty tax on gain attributable to the transaction 

from time to time we may transfer or otherwise dispose of some of our properties under the code any gain resulting from transfers of properties that we hold as inventory or primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business would be treated as income from a prohibited transaction subject to a 100 penalty tax since we acquire properties for investment purposes we do not believe that our occasional transfers or disposals of property are properly treated as prohibited transactions however whether property is held for investment purposes is a question of fact that depends on all the facts and circumstances surrounding the particular transaction the internal revenue service may contend that certain transfers or disposals of properties by us are prohibited transactions while we believe that the internal revenue service would not prevail in any such dispute if the internal revenue service were to argue successfully that a transfer or disposition of property constituted a prohibited transaction then we would be required to pay a 100 penalty tax on any gain from the prohibited transaction in addition income from a prohibited transaction might adversely affect our ability to satisfy the income tests for qualification as a reit for federal income tax purposes 

to maintain our reit status we may be forced to borrow funds on a shortterm basis during unfavorable market conditions 

to qualify as a reit each year we must distribute to our stockholders at least 90 of our real estate investment trust taxable income computed without regard to our dividends paid deduction and our net capital gain if we distribute less than 100 of our reit taxable income in any year we will be subject to regular corporate income taxes in addition we will be subject to a 4 excise tax on the amount if any by which distributions paid by us in any calendar year are less than the sum of 85 of our ordinary income 95 of our capital gain net income and 100 of our undistributed income from prior years for distributions with respect to taxable years ending on or before december 31 2009 recent internal revenue service guidance allows us to satisfy up to 90 of these requirements through the distribution of shares of hcp inc common stock if certain conditions are met to maintain our reit status and avoid the payment of income and excise taxes we may need to borrow funds on a shortterm basis to meet the reit distribution requirements even if the thenprevailing market conditions are not favorable for these borrowings these shortterm borrowing needs could result from differences in timing between the actual receipt of cash and inclusion of income for federal income tax 

purposes or the effect of nondeductible capital expenditures the creation of reserves or required debt principal payments 

as a result of the acquisition of seusa hcp life science reit may have inherited tax liabilities and attributes from seusa 

hcp life science reit is the successor to the tax attributes including tax basis and earnings and profits if any of seusa if hcp life science reit recognizes gain on the disposition of any properties formerly owned by seusa during the tenyear period beginning on the date on which it acquired the seusa stock it will be required to pay tax at the highest regular corporate tax rate on such gain to the extent of the excess of a the fair market value of the asset over b its adjusted basis in the asset in each case determined as of the date on which it acquired the seusa stock any taxes paid by hcp life science reit would reduce the amount available for distribution by hcp life science reit to us 

as a result of the crp merger and the crc merger we may have inherited tax liabilities and attributes from crp and crc 

in connection with the crp merger crps reit counsel rendered an opinion to us dated as of the closing date of the merger substantially to the effect that on the basis of the facts representations and assumptions set forth or referred to in such opinions crp qualified as a reit under the code for the taxable years ending december 31 1999 through the closing date of the merger if however contrary to the opinion of crps reit counsel crp failed to qualify as a reit for any of its taxable years it would be required to pay federal income tax including any applicable alternative minimum tax on its taxable income at regular corporate rates because the crp merger was treated for income tax purposes as if crp sold all of its assets in a taxable transaction to hcp inc if crp did not qualify as a reit for the taxable year of the merger it would be subject to tax on the excess of the fair market value of its assets over their adjusted tax basis as a successor in interest to crp hcp inc would be required to pay this tax 

as a result of the crc merger hcp inc succeeded to the assets and the liabilities of crc including any liabilities for unpaid taxes and any tax liabilities created in connection with the crc merger at the closing of the crc merger we received an opinion of our counsel substantially to the effect that on the basis of the facts representations and assumptions set forth or referred to in such opinions for federal income tax purposes the crc merger qualified as a reorganization within the meaning of section 368a of the code if however contrary to the opinion of our counsel the crc merger did not qualify as a reorganization within the meaning of section 368a of the code the crc merger would have been treated as a sale of crcs assets to hcp inc in a taxable transaction and crc would have recognized taxable gain in such a case as crcs successorininterest hcp inc would be required to pay the tax on any such gain 

as a result of the crc merger and the acquisition of seusa hcp inc andor our subsidiary hcp life science reit may be required to distribute earnings and profits 

hcp inc succeeded to the tax attributes including the earnings and profits of crc assuming the crc merger qualified as reorganizations under the code similarly hcp life science reit succeeded to the tax attributes including the earnings and profits of seusa to qualify as a reit hcp inc and hcp life science reit must have distributed any nonreit earnings and profits by the close of the taxable year in which each of these transactions occurred any adjustments to the income of crc or seusa for taxable years ending on or before the closing date of the applicable transactions including as a result of an examination of the tax returns of either company by the internal revenue service could affect the calculation of such companys earnings and profits if the internal revenue service were to determine that hcp inc or hcp life science reit acquired 

nonreit earnings and profits from one or more of these predecessor entities that hcp inc or hcp life science reit failed to distribute prior to the end of the taxable year in which the applicable transaction occurred hcp inc and hcp life science reit could avoid disqualification as a reit by paying a deficiency dividend under these procedures hcp inc or hcp life science reit generally would be required to distribute any such nonreit earnings and profits to its respective stockholders within 90 days of the determination and pay a statutory interest charge at a specified rate to the internal revenue service such a distribution would be in addition to the distribution of reit taxable income necessary to satisfy the reit distribution requirement and may require that hcp inc or hcp life science reit as applicable borrow funds to make the distribution even if the thenprevailing market conditions are not favorable for borrowings in addition payment of the statutory interest charge could materially adversely affect the cash flow of the applicable reit

• removal of directors subject to the rights of one or more classes or series of preferred stock to elect one or more directors our charter provides that a director may only be removed by the affirmative vote or written consent of the holders of at least twothirds of the outstanding shares or by a unanimous vote of all other members of the board of directors • stockholder requested special meetings our bylaws only permit our stockholders to call a special meeting upon the written request of the stockholders holding in the aggregate not less than 50 of the outstanding shares entitled to vote on the business proposed to be transacted at such meeting • advance notice provisions for stockholder nominations and proposals our bylaws do not permit stockholders to nominate persons for election as directors at or to bring other business before any meeting of stockholders unless we are notified in a timely manner in writing prior to the meeting • preferred stock under our charter our board of directors has authority to issue preferred stock from time to time in one or more series and to establish the terms preferences and rights of any such series of preferred stock all without the approval of our stockholders 33 

• duties of directors with respect to unsolicited takeovers maryland law provides protection for maryland corporations against unsolicited takeovers by limiting among other things the duties of the directors in unsolicited takeover situations the duties of directors of maryland corporations do not require them to a accept recommend or respond to any proposal by a person seeking to acquire control of the corporation b make a determination under the maryland business combination act or the maryland control share acquisition act or c act or fail to act solely because of the effect that the act or failure to act may have on an acquisition or potential acquisition of control of the corporation or the amount or type of consideration that may be offered or paid to the stockholders in an acquisition moreover an act of a director of a maryland corporation relating to or affecting an acquisition or potential acquisition of control is not subject to any higher duty or greater scrutiny than is applied to any other act of a director maryland law also contains a statutory presumption that an act of a director of a maryland corporation satisfies the applicable standards of conduct for directors under maryland law • unsolicited takeovers under maryland law a maryland corporation with a class of equity securities registered under the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended and at least three independent directors may elect to be subject to certain statutory provisions relating to unsolicited takeovers which among other things would automatically classify the board of directors into three classes with staggered terms of three years each and vest in the board of directors the exclusive right to determine the number of directors and the exclusive right by the affirmative vote of a majority of the remaining directors to fill vacancies on the board of directors even if the remaining directors do not constitute a quorum these statutory provisions relating to unsolicited takeovers also provide that any director elected to fill a vacancy shall hold office for the remainder of the full term of the class of directors in which the vacancy occurred rather than the next annual meeting of directors as would otherwise be the case and until the directors successor is elected and qualified an election to be subject to any or all of the foregoing statutory provisions may be made in our charter or bylaws or by resolution of our board of directors without stockholder approval any such statutory provision to which we elect to be subject will apply even if other provisions of maryland law or our charter or bylaws provide to the contrary neither our charter nor our bylaws provides that we are subject to any of the foregoing statutory provisions relating to unsolicited takeovers however our board of directors could adopt a resolution without stockholder approval to elect to become subject to some or all of these statutory provisions 

if we made an election to be subject to such statutory provisions and our board of directors was divided into three classes with staggered terms of office of three years each the classification and staggered terms of office of our directors would make it more difficult for a third party to gain control of our board of directors since at least two annual meetings of stockholders instead of one generally would be required to effect a change in the majority of our board of directors 

• maryland business combination act the maryland business combination act provides that unless exempted a maryland corporation may not engage in business combinations including mergers dispositions of 10 or more of its assets issuances of shares of stock and other specified transactions with an interested stockholder or an affiliate of an interested stockholder for five years after the most recent date on which the interested stockholder became an interested stockholder and thereafter unless specified criteria are met an interested stockholder is generally a person owning or controlling directly or indirectly 10 or more of the voting power of the outstanding stock of a maryland corporation unless our board of directors takes action to exempt us generally or with respect to certain transactions from this statute in the future the maryland business combination act will be applicable to business combinations between us and other persons in addition to the restrictions on business combinations provided under maryland law our charter also contains restrictions on business 34 

combinations our charter requires that except in some circumstances business combinations between us and a related person including a beneficial holder of 10 or more of our outstanding voting stock be approved by the affirmative vote of at least 90 of our outstanding voting shares 

• maryland control share acquisition act maryland law provides that control shares of a corporation acquired in a control share acquisition shall have no voting rights except to the extent approved by a vote of twothirds of the votes eligible to be cast on the matter under the maryland control share acquisition act control shares means shares of stock that if aggregated with all other shares of stock previously acquired by the acquiror would entitle the acquiror to exercise voting power in electing directors within one of the following ranges of the voting power onetenth or more but less than onethird onethird or more but less than a majority or a majority or more of all voting power a control share acquisition means the acquisition of control shares subject to certain exceptions if voting rights or control shares acquired in a control share acquisition are not approved at a stockholders meeting then subject to certain conditions and limitations the issuer may redeem any or all of the control shares for fair value if voting rights of such control shares are approved at a stockholders meeting and the acquiror becomes entitled to vote a majority of the shares of stock entitled to vote all other stockholders may exercise appraisal rights if any of our shares are control shares acquired in a control share acquisition they will be subject to the maryland control share acquisition act unless our bylaws are amended in the future to exempt the acquisition of control shares generally or with respect to certain transactions 

our issuance of additional shares of common or preferred stock warrants or debt securities may dilute the ownership interests of existing stockholders and reduce the market price for our shares 

as of december 31 2008 we had 2536 million shares of common stock issued and outstanding we cannot predict the effect if any that potential future sales of our common or preferred stock warrants or debt securities or the availability of our securities for future sale will have on the market price of our outstanding securities including our common stock sales of substantial amounts of our common or preferred stock warrants or debt securities convertible into or exercisable or exchangeable for common stock in the public market or the perception that such sales might occur could reduce the market price of our common stock the sales of any such securities could also dilute the interests of existing common stockholders and may cause a decrease in the market price of our common stock additionally we maintain equity incentive plans for our employees we have historically made grants of stock options restricted stock and restricted stock units to our employees under such plans and we expect to continue to do so as of december 31 2008 there were options to purchase approximately 51 million shares of our common stock outstanding of which 20 million shares are exercisable approximately 380000 unvested shares of restricted stock issued and outstanding and approximately 864000 unvested restricted stock units issued and outstanding under our equity incentive plans

 item 3 legal proceedings 

from time to time we are a party to legal proceedings lawsuits and other claims that arise in the ordinary course of business regardless of their merits these matters may force us to expend significant financial resources except as described below we are not aware of any legal proceedings or claims that we believe may have individually or taken together a material adverse effect on our business prospects financial condition or results of operations our policy is to accrue legal expenses as they are incurred the information set forth under the heading legal proceedings of note 14 to the consolidated financial statements included in part iii item 15 of this report is incorporated herein by reference 

on may 3 2007 ventas inc filed a complaint against hcp in the united states district court for the western district of kentucky asserting claims of tortious interference with contract and tortious interference with prospective business advantage the complaint alleges among other things that we interfered with ventas purchase agreement with sunrise senior living real estate investment trust sunrise reit that we interfered with ventas prospective business advantage in connection with the sunrise reit transaction and that our actions caused ventas to suffer damages as set forth in a statement filed by ventas on january 20 2009 ventas claims damages of 122 million representing the 

difference between the price it initially agreed to pay for sunrise reit and the price it ultimately paid additional claimed damages of 188 million for alleged financing and other costs and punitive damages 

we believe that ventas claims are without merit and intend both to vigorously defend against ventas lawsuit and to aggressively pursue our counterclaims against ventas as successor to sunrise reit as set forth in a statement filed by us on january 20 2009 we seek recovery of damages in excess of 300 million against ventas our counterclaims allege among other things that sunrise reit i fraudulently or negligently induced us to participate in a rigged flawed and unfair auction process ii fraudulently or negligently induced us to enter into a confidentiality and standstill agreement that was materially different from the agreement entered into with ventas iii provided unfair assistance to ventas and iv changed the rules of the auction at the last minute and such change prevented us from bidding the counterclaims further allege that at all times sunrise reit knew that we were the highest bidder and presumptive winner of the auction absent such misconduct by sunrise reit we allege that we would have succeeded in acquiring sunrise reit the amended counterclaims allege that ventas in acquiring sunrise reit assumed the liability of sunrise reit to us on december 23 2008 ventas filed a motion for judgment on the pleadings seeking dismissal of our counterclaims and we have responded to ventas motion the district court has not rendered a decision on ventas motion 

the court has set a trial date of august 18 2009 we intend to pursue our claims described above vigorously however there can be no assurances that we will prevail on any of these claims or the amount of any recovery that may be awarded we expect that defending our interests and pursuing our own claims in the above matters will require us to expend significant funds we are unable to estimate the ultimate aggregate amount of monetary gain loss or financial impact with respect to these matters as of december 31 2008

the information set forth in this item 7 is intended to provide readers with an understanding of our financial condition changes in financial condition and results of operations we will discuss and provide our analysis in the following order 

• executive summary • 2008 transaction overview • dividends • critical accounting policies • results of operations • liquidity and capital resources • offbalance sheet arrangements • contractual obligations • inflation • recent accounting pronouncements executive summary 

we are a selfadministered reit that together with our consolidated subsidiaries invests primarily in real estate serving the healthcare industry in the united states we acquire develop lease manage and dispose of healthcare real estate and provide financing to healthcare providers at december 31 2008 our portfolio of investments excluding assets held for sale but including properties owned by our investment management platform consisted of interests in 694 facilities 

our business strategy is based on three principles i opportunistic investing ii portfolio diversification and iii conservative financing we actively redeploy capital from investments with lower return potential into assets with higher return potential and recycle capital from shorterterm to longerterm investments we make investments where the expected riskadjusted return exceeds our cost of capital and strive to leverage our operator tenant and other business relationships 

our strategy contemplates acquiring and developing properties on terms that are favorable to us we attempt to structure transactions that are taxadvantaged and mitigate risks in our underwriting process generally we prefer larger more complex private transactions that leverage our management teams experience and our infrastructure 

we follow a disciplined approach to enhancing the value of our existing portfolio including ongoing evaluation of potential disposition of properties that no longer fit our strategy during the year ended december 31 2008 we sold 51 properties for 643 million at december 31 2008 we had six properties with a carrying amount of 154 million classified as held for sale 

we primarily generate revenue by leasing healthcare properties under longterm leases most of our rents and other earned income from leases are received under triplenet leases or leases that 

provide for substantial recovery of operating expenses however some of our mobs and life science leases are structured as gross or modified gross leases accordingly for such mobs and life science facilities we incur certain property operating expenses such as real estate taxes repairs and maintenance property management fees utilities and insurance our growth depends in part on our ability to i increase rental income and other earned income from leases by increasing rental rates and occupancy levels ii maximize tenant recoveries given underlying lease structures and iii control operating and other expenses our operations are impacted by property specific market specific general economic and other conditions 

access to external capital on favorable terms is critical to the success of our strategy generally we attempt to match the longterm duration of most of our investments with longterm fixedrate financing at december 31 2008 15 of our consolidated debt is at variable interest rates which includes a balance of 520 million outstanding under our bridge and term loans we intend to maintain an investment grade rating on our senior debt securities and manage various capital ratios and amounts within appropriate parameters 

access to capital markets impacts our cost of capital and ability to refinance maturing indebtedness as well as to fund future acquisitions and development through the issuance of additional securities or secured debt during 2008 we have raised 10 billion of equity capital 656 million from asset dispositions 566 million from the placement of federal national mortgage association fannie mae secured debt and 197 million in a bank term loan in 2008 there was a decline in the availability of financing from the capital markets and widening credit spreads our ability to continue to access capital could be impacted by various factors including general market conditions and the continuing slowdown in the economy interest rates credit ratings on our securities and any changes to these ratings the market price of our capital stock the performance of our portfolio tenants borrowers and operators including any restructurings disruptions or bankruptcies of our tenants borrowers and operators the perception of our potential future earnings and cash distributions any unwillingness on the part of lenders to make loans to us and any deterioration in the financial position of lenders that might make them unable to meet their obligations to us

critical accounting policies 

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap requires our management to use judgment in the application of accounting policies including making estimates and assumptions we base estimates on our experience and on various other assumptions believed to be reasonable under the circumstances these estimates affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods if our judgment or interpretation of the facts and circumstances relating to various transactions or other matters had been different it is possible that different accounting would have been applied resulting in a different presentation of our consolidated financial statements for a description of the risk associated with our critical accounting policies see risk factors—risks related to hcp in item 1a from time to time we reevaluate our estimates and assumptions in the event estimates or assumptions prove to be different from actual results adjustments are made in subsequent periods to reflect more current estimates and assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain 

principles of consolidation 

the consolidated financial statements include the accounts of hcp our whollyowned subsidiaries and joint ventures that we control through voting rights or other means we apply financial accounting standards board fasb interpretation no 46r consolidation of variable interest entities  as revised fin 46r for arrangements with variable interest entities vies we consolidate investments in vies when we are the primary beneficiary of the vie at either the creation of the variable interest entity or upon the occurrence of a qualifying reconsideration event we also apply emerging issues task force eitf issue 045 investors accounting for an investment in a limited partnership when the investor is the sole general partner and the limited partners have certain rights eitf 0405 to investments in joint ventures 

our judgment with respect to our level of influence or control of an entity and whether we are or are not the primary beneficiary of a vie consideration of various factors including but not limited to the form of our ownership interest our representation on the entitys governing body the size and seniority of our investment various cash flow scenarios related to the vie our ability to participate in policy making decisions and the rights of the other investors to participate in the decision making process and to replace us as manager andor liquidate the venture if applicable our ability to correctly assess our influence or control over an entity at inception of our involvement or upon a reconsideration event and determine the primary beneficiary of a vie affects the presentation of these entities in our consolidated financial statements if we were to perform a primary beneficiary analysis upon the occurrence of a future reconsideration event our assumptions may be different which could result in the identification of a different primary beneficiary 

if we determine that we are the primary beneficiary of a vie our consolidated financial statements would include the results of the vie either tenant or borrower rather than the results of our lease or loan to the vie we would depend on the vie to provide us timely financial information and we would rely on the internal controls of the vie to provide accurate financial information if the vie has deficiencies in its internal controls over financial reporting or does not provide us with timely financial information this may adversely impact our financial reporting and our internal controls over financial reporting 

revenue recognition 

rental income from tenants is recognized in accordance with gaap including sec staff accounting bulletin no 104 revenue recognition sab 104 we recognize rental revenue on a straightline basis over the lease term when collectibility is reasonably assured and the tenant has taken possession or controls the physical use of the leased asset for assets acquired subject to leases we recognize revenue upon acquisition of the asset provided the tenant has taken possession or controls the physical use of the leased asset if the lease provides for tenant improvements we determine whether the tenant improvements for accounting purposes are owned by the tenant or us when we are the owner of the tenant improvements the tenant is not considered to have taken physical possession or have control of the physical use of the leased asset until the tenant improvements are substantially completed when the tenant is the owner of the tenant improvements any tenant improvement allowance funded is treated as a lease incentive and amortized as a reduction of revenue over the lease term the determination of ownership of the tenant improvements is subject to significant judgment tenant improvement ownership is determined based on various factors including but not limited to 

• whether the lease stipulates how and on what a tenant improvement allowance may be spent • whether the tenant or landlord retains legal title to the improvements at the end of the lease term • whether the tenant improvements are unique to the tenant or generalpurpose in nature and • whether the tenant improvements are expected to have any residual value at the end of the lease if our assessment of the owner of the tenant improvements for accounting purposes were to change the timing and amount of our revenue recognized would be impacted 

certain leases provide for additional rents contingent upon a percentage of the facilitys revenue in excess of specified base amounts or other thresholds such revenue is recognized when actual results reported by the tenant or estimates of tenant results exceed the base amount or other thresholds the recognition of additional rents requires us to make estimates of amounts owed and to a certain extent are dependent on the accuracy of the facility results reported to us our estimates may differ from actual results which could be material to our consolidated financial statements 

we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts including an allowance for straightline rent receivables for estimated losses resulting from tenant defaults or the inability of tenants to make contractual rent and tenant recovery payments we monitor the liquidity and creditworthiness of our tenants and operators on an ongoing basis this evaluation considers industry and economic conditions property performance credit enhancements and other factors for straightline rent amounts our assessment is based on income recoverable over the term of the lease we exercise judgment in establishing allowances and consider payment history and current credit status in developing these estimates these estimates may differ from actual results which could be material to our consolidated financial statements 

we use the direct finance method of accounting to record income from dfls for leases accounted for as dfls future minimum lease payments are recorded as a receivable the difference between the future minimum lease payments and the estimated residual values less the cost of the properties is recorded as unearned income unearned income is deferred and amortized to income over the lease terms to provide a constant yield when collectibility of the lease payments is reasonably assured investments in dfls are presented net of unamortized unearned income 

loans receivable are classified as heldforinvestment based on managements intent and ability to hold the loans for the foreseeable future or to maturity loans heldforinvestment are carried at 

amortized cost reduced by a valuation allowance for estimated credit losses we recognize interest income on loans including the amortization of discounts and premiums using the effective interest method applied on a loanbyloan basis when collectibility of the future payments is reasonably assured premiums and discounts are recognized as yield adjustments over the life of the related loans loans are transferred from heldforinvestment to heldforsale when managements intent is to no longer hold the loans for the foreseeable future loans heldforsale are recorded at the lower of cost or fair value 

allowances are established for loans and dfls based upon a probable loss estimate for individual loans and dfls deemed to be impaired loans and dfls are impaired when it is deemed probable that we will be unable to collect all amounts due on a timely basis in accordance with the contractual terms of the loan or lease determining the adequacy of the allowance is complex and requires significant judgment by us about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain the allowance is based upon our assessment of the borrowers or lessees overall financial condition resources and payment record the prospects for support from any financially responsible guarantors and if appropriate the realizable value of any collateral these estimates consider all available evidence including as appropriate the present value of the expected future cash flows discounted at the loans or dfls effective interest rate the fair value of collateral general economic conditions and trends historical and industry loss experience and other relevant factors while our assumptions are based in part upon historical data our estimates may differ from actual results which could be material to our consolidated financial statements 

loans and dfls are placed on nonaccrual status at such time as management determines that collectibility of contractual amounts is not reasonably assured while on nonaccrual status loans or dfls are either accounted for on a cash basis in which income is recognized only upon receipt of cash or on a costrecovery basis in which all cash receipts reduce the carrying value of the loan or dfl based on managements judgment of collectibility 

real estate 

real estate consisting of land buildings and improvements is recorded at cost we allocate the cost of the acquisition including the assumption of liabilities to the acquired tangible assets and identified intangibles based on their estimated fair values in accordance with sfas no 141 business combinations  in december 2007 the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 141r business combinations  as revised sfas no 141r sfas no 141r is effective for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2008 the adoption of sfas no 141r on january 1 2009 will among other things require us to prospectively expense all transaction costs for business combinations the implementation of sfas no 141r on january 1 2009 could materially impact our future financial results to the extent that we acquire significant amounts of real estate as related acquisition costs will be expensed as incurred rather than our past practice of capitalizing such costs and amortizing them over the estimated useful life of the assets acquired 

we assess fair value based on estimated cash flow projections that utilize appropriate discount andor capitalization rates and available market information estimates of future cash flows are based on a number of factors including historical operating results known and anticipated trends and market and economic conditions the fair value of the tangible assets of an acquired property considers the value of the property as if it was vacant 

we record acquired above and below market leases at fair value using discount rates which reflect the risks associated with the leases acquired the amount recorded is based on the present value of the difference between i the contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to each inplace lease and ii our estimate of fair market lease rates for each inplace lease measured over a period equal to the remaining term of the lease for above market leases and the initial term plus extended term for any 

leases with below market renewal options other intangible assets acquired include amounts for inplace lease values that are based on our evaluation of the specific characteristics of each tenants lease factors to be considered include estimates of carrying costs during hypothetical expected leaseup periods market conditions and costs to execute similar leases in estimating carrying costs we include estimates of lost rentals at market rates during the hypothetical expected leaseup periods which are dependent on local market conditions in estimating costs to execute similar leases we consider leasing commissions legal and other related costs 

we are required to make subjective assessments to allocate the purchase price paid to acquire investments in real estate among the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on our estimate of the fair values of such assets and liabilities this includes determining the value of the buildings and improvements land ground leases tenant improvements inplace tenant leases favorable or unfavorable market leases and any debt assumed from the seller or loans made by the seller to us each of these estimates requires significant judgment and some of the estimates involve complex calculations and judgments about useful lives these allocation assessments have a direct impact on our results of operations as amounts allocated to some assets and liabilities are not subject to depreciation or amortization and those that are have different lives additionally the amortization of value assigned to favorable or unfavorable market rate leases is recorded as an adjustment to rental revenue as compared to amortization of the value of inplace leases which is included in depreciation and amortization in our consolidated statements of income 

impairment of longlived assets and goodwill 

we assess the carrying value of real estate assets and related intangibles real estate assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable in accordance with sfas no 144 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas no 144 we test our real estate assets for impairment by comparing the sum of the expected undiscounted cash flows to the carrying amount of the real estate asset or asset group if the carrying value exceeds the expected undiscounted cash flows an impairment loss will be recognized by adjusting the carrying amount of the real estate assets to their estimated fair value our ability to accurately predict future operating results and cash flows and to accurately estimate and allocate fair values impacts the timing and recognition of real estate asset impairments while we believe our assumptions are reasonable changes in these assumptions such as the anticipated hold period for an asset may have a material impact on our financial results 

goodwill is tested for impairment by applying the twostep approach defined in sfas no 142 goodwill and other intangible assets at least annually and whenever we identify triggering events that may indicate impairment potential impairment indicators include a significant decline in real estate valuations restructuring plans or a decline in our market capitalization below book value we test for impairment of our goodwill by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit containing goodwill to its carrying value if the carrying value exceeds the fair value the second step of the test is needed to measure the amount of potential goodwill impairment the second step requires the fair value of the reporting unit to be allocated to all the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit as if it had been acquired in a business combination at the date of the impairment test the excess fair value of the reporting unit over the fair value of assets and liabilities is the implied value of goodwill and is used to determine the amount of impairment we selected the fourth quarter of each fiscal year to perform our annual impairment test 

the evaluation of goodwill requires significant judgments and estimates when determining fair value including but not limited to real estate market capitalization rates projected future cash flows discount rates and the fair value of hcp we estimated the fair value of hcp based on the market capitalization of our outstanding shares at december 31 2008 and a control premium of approximately ten percent this control premium approximates comparable sale transactions during the 18 months 

prior to our impairment test we also performed various sensitivity analyses in which real estate capitalization rates discount rates and the control premium were expanded or contracted by 50 to 100 basis points noting that the results would not lead to an impairment of our goodwill assets our estimates may differ from actual results due to among other things economic conditions or changes in operating performance while we believe our assumptions are reasonable changes in these assumptions such as significant expansions in real estate market capitalization rates may have a material impact on our financial results 

investments in unconsolidated joint ventures 

investments in entities which we do not consolidate but for which we have the ability to exercise significant influence over operating and financial policies are reported under the equity method of accounting under the equity method of accounting our share of the investees earnings or losses are included in our consolidated results of operations 

the initial carrying value of investments in unconsolidated joint ventures is based on the amount paid to purchase the joint venture interest or the carrying value of the assets prior to the sale of interests in the joint venture we evaluate our equity method investments for impairment based upon a comparison of the fair value of the equity method investment to our carrying value when we determine that a decline in the fair value of our investment in an unconsolidated joint venture is otherthantemporary and is below its carrying value an impairment is recorded the determination of the fair value of investments in unconsolidated joint ventures involves significant judgment our estimates consider all available evidence including as appropriate the present value of the expected future cash flows discounted at market rates general economic conditions and trends and other relevant factors while we believe our assumptions are reasonable changes in these assumptions may have a material impact on our financial results 

income taxes 

as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements significant management judgment is required to evaluate our compliance with reit requirements our determinations are based on interpretation of tax laws and our conclusions may have an impact on the income tax expense recognized adjustments to income tax expense may be required as a result of i audits conducted by federal and state tax authorities ii our ability to qualify as a reit iii the potential for builtingain recognized related to priortaxfree acquisitions of c corporations and iv changes in tax laws adjustments required in any given period are included in income other than adjustments to income tax liabilities acquired in business combinations which are adjusted through goodwill

rental and related revenues 



1 percentage change not meaningful • senior housing senior housing rental and related revenues decreased by 35 million to 2899 million for the year ended december 31 2008 primarily as a result of income of 91 million recognized in 2007 resulting from our change in estimate relating to the collectibility of straightlined rents due from emeritus which was partially offset by the additive effect of our acquisitions during 2008 and 2007 no significant changes in estimates related to the collectibility of straightlined rents were made during the year ended december 31 2008 • life science life science rental and related revenues increased by 1288 million to 2084 million for the year ended december 31 2008 primarily as a result of our acquisition of seusa on august 1 2007 in addition included in life science rental and related revenues for the year ended december 31 2008 is lease termination income of 18 million received from a tenant in connection with the early termination of three leases on july 30 2008 and rental revenues related to three development projects that were placed into service in 2008 • medical office medical office rental and related revenues for the year ended december 31 2007 includes 18 million from assets that are no longer consolidated and are now in the hcp ventures iv llc joint venture hcp ventures iv the decrease in medical office rental and related revenues resulting from hcp ventures iv was partially offset by the additive effect of our mob acquisitions during 2007 tenant recoveries 



the increase in tenant recoveries for the year ended december 31 2008 was primarily as a result of our acquisition of seusa on august 1 2007 three development projects that were placed into service in 2008 and the additive effect of our other acquisitions during 2007 partially offset by tenant recoveries related to the assets contributed to hcp ventures iv 

income from direct financing leases income from dfls decreased 57 million to 581 million for the year ended december 31 2008 the decrease was primarily due to two dfl tenants exercising their purchase options on our leased assets during 2007 and two additional dfls that were placed on nonaccrual status and accounted for on a costrecovery basis beginning october 2008 no purchase options were exercised during 2008 we expect that income from dfls will decline in 2009 as a result of the two dfls that are accounted for on a costrecovery basis 

investment management fee income investment management fee income decreased 77 million to 59 million for the year ended december 31 2008 the decrease in investment management fee income was primarily due to the acquisition fees earned related to our hcp ventures ii joint venture of 54 million on january 5 2007 and hcp ventures iv of 30 million on april 30 2007 no acquisition fees were earned for the year ended december 31 2008

our leases often provide for either fixed increases in base rents or indexed escalators based on the consumer price index or other measures andor additional rent based on increases in the tenants operating revenues substantially all of our mob leases require the tenant to pay a share of property operating costs such as real estate taxes insurance and utilities substantially all of our senior housing life science skilled nursing and hospital leases require the operator or tenant to pay all of the property operating costs or reimburse us for all such costs we believe that inflationary increases in expenses will be offset in part by the operator or tenant expense reimbursements and contractual rent increases described above

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

interest rate risk at december 31 2008 we were exposed to market risks related to fluctuations in interest rates on approximately 10 billion of variable rate mezzanine loans receivable and 111 million investment in leased assets whose rental payments fluctuate with changes in libor our exposure to income fluctuations related to our variable rate investments is partially offset by i 150 million of variable rate line of credit borrowings ii 520 million of variable rate bridge and term financing iii 197 million of variable rate mortgage notes payable excluding 46 million variable rate mortgage notes which have been hedged through interest rate swap contracts and iv 25 million of variable rate senior unsecured notes of our consolidated debt of 60 billion at december 31 2008 excluding the 46 million of variable rate debt where the rates have been swapped to a fixed rate 892 million or 15 is at variable interest rates 

interest rate fluctuations will generally not affect our future earnings or cash flows on our fixed rate debt loans receivable and debt securities unless such instruments mature or are otherwise 

terminated however interest rate changes will affect the fair value of our fixed rate instruments conversely changes in interest rates on variable rate debt and investments would change our future earnings and cash flows but not significantly affect the fair value of those instruments assuming a one percentage point increase in the interest rate related to the variablerate investments and variablerate debt and assuming no change in the outstanding balance as of december 31 2008 net interest income would improve by approximately 22 million or 001 per common share on a diluted basis assuming a 50 basis point decrease in interest rates under the above circumstances and taking into consideration that the index underlying many of our arrangements is currently below 50 basis points and is not expected to go below zero net interest income would decline by 11 million 

we use derivative financial instruments in the normal course of business to manage or hedge interest rate risk we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes derivatives are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value in accordance with sfas no 133 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  see note 16 to the consolidated financial statements in this report for further information in this regard 

at december 31 2008 we had three interest rate swap contracts outstanding which are designated in qualifying cash flow hedging relationships on december 31 2008 the interest rate swap contracts have an aggregate notional amount and fair value of 456 million and a 23 million liability respectively the derivative contracts mature in july 2020 and are currently recognized in accounts payable and accrued liabilities 

to illustrate the effect of movements in the interest rate markets we performed a market sensitivity analysis on the noted hedging instruments to do so we applied various basis point spreads to the underlying interest rates of the derivative portfolio in order to determine the instruments change in fair value the following table summarizes the analysis performed dollars in thousands 



market risk we are directly and indirectly affected by changes in the equity and bond markets we have investments in marketable debt and equity securities classified as available for sale gains and losses on these securities are recognized in income when realized and losses are recognized when an otherthantemporary decline in value is identified the initial indicator of an otherthantemporary decline in value for marketable equity securities is a sustained decline in market price below the carrying value for that investment we consider a variety of factors in evaluating an otherthantemporary decline in value such as the length of time and the extent to which the market value has been less than our cost the issuers financial condition capital strength and nearterm prospects any recent events specific to that issuer and economic conditions of its industry and our investment horizon in relationship to an anticipated nearterm recovery in the stock or bond price if any at december 31 2008 the fair value and cost or the new basis for those securities where a realized loss was recorded of marketable equity securities was 38 million and 42 million respectively and the fair value and cost of marketable debt securities was 229 million and 295 million respectively 

the principal amount and the average interest rates for our loans receivable and debt categorized by maturity dates is presented in the table below the fair value for our debt securities and senior unsecured notes payable are based on prevailing market prices the fair value estimates for loans 

receivable and mortgage debt payable are based on discounting future cash flows utilizing current rates offered to us for loans and debt of the same type and remaining maturity

the delivery of healthcare services requires real estate and as a consequence healthcare providers depend on real estate to maintain and grow their businesses hcp believes that the current healthcare real estate market provides an investment opportunity due to the 

·   likelihood of consolidation of the fragmented healthcare real estate sector

·   specialized nature of healthcare real estate investing and

·   compelling demographics driving the demand for healthcare services

senior citizens are the largest consumers of healthcare services according to the centers for medicare and medicaid on a per capita basis the 75 years and older segment of the population spends 75 more on healthcare than the 65 to 74yearold segment and nearly 300 more than the population average

business strategy 

we are organized to invest in healthcarerelated facilities our primary goal is to increase shareholder value through profitable growth our investment strategy to achieve this goal is based on three principles—opportunistic investing portfolio diversification and conservative financing 

opportunistic investing 

we make real estate investments that are expected to drive profitable growth and create longterm shareholder value we attempt to position ourselves to create and take advantage of situations to meet our goals and investment criteria we invest in properties directly and through joint ventures and provide secured financing depending on the nature of the investment opportunity 

portfolio diversification 

we believe in maintaining a portfolio of healthcarerelated real estate diversified by sector geography operator and investment product diversification within the healthcare industry reduces the likelihood that a single event would materially harm our business this allows us to take advantage of opportunities in different markets based on individual market dynamics while pursuing our strategy of 

maintaining diversification in our portfolio there are no specific limitations under our certificate of incorporation and bylaws on the percentage of our total assets that may be invested in any one property property type geographic location or in the number of properties which we may invest in lease or lend to a single operator with investments in multiple sectors of healthcare real estate hcp can focus on opportunities with the best riskreward profile for the portfolio as a whole rather than having to choose from transactions within a specific property type 

conservative financing 

we believe a conservative balance sheet provides us with the ability to execute our opportunistic investing approach and portfolio diversification principles we maintain our conservative balance sheet by actively managing our debt to equity levels and maintaining available sources of liquidity such as our revolving line of credit our debt is primarily fixed rate which reduces the impact of rising interest rates on our operations generally we attempt to match the longterm duration of our leases with longterm fixedrate financing 

in underwriting our investments we structure and adjust the price of the investment in accordance with our assessment of risk we may structure transactions as master leases require indemnifications obtain enhancements in the form of letters of credit or security deposits and take other measures to mitigate risk we finance our investments based on our evaluation of available sources of funding for shortterm purposes we may utilize our revolving line of credit or arrange for other shortterm borrowings from banks or other sources we arrange for longerterm financing through public offerings or from institutional investors we may incur additional indebtedness or issue preferred or common stock we may incur additional mortgage indebtedness on real estate we acquire we may also obtain nonrecourse or other mortgage financing on unleveraged properties in which we have invested or may refinance existing debt on properties acquired 

competition 

our properties compete with the facilities of other landlords and healthcare providers the landlords and operators of these competing properties may have capital resources substantially in excess of ours or of the operators of our facilities the occupancy and rental income at our properties depend upon several factors including the number of physicians using the healthcare facilities or referring patients to the facilities competing properties and healthcare providers and the size and composition of the population in the surrounding area private federal and state payment programs and the effect of laws and regulations may also have a significant influence on the profitability of the properties and their tenants virtually all of our properties operate in a competitive environment in which tenants patients and referral sources including physicians may change their preferences for a healthcare facility from time to time 

investing in real estate is highly competitive we face competition from other reits investment companies healthcare operators and other institutional investors when we attempt to acquire properties increased competition reduces the number of opportunities that meet our investment criteria if we do not identify investments that meet our investment criteria our ability to increase shareholder value through profitable growth may be limited

4   net operating income from continuing operations “noi” is a nongaap supplemental financial measure used to evaluate the operating performance of real estate properties we define noi as rental revenues including tenant reimbursements less property level operating expenses which excludes depreciation and amortization general and administrative expenses impairments interest expense and discontinued operations we believe noi provides investors relevant and useful information because it measures the operating performance of our real estate at the property level on an unleveraged basis we use noi to make decisions about resource allocations and assess property level performance we believe that net income is the most directly comparable gaap us generally accepted accounting principals measure to noi noi should not be viewed as an alternative measure of operating performance to net income as defined by gaap since it does not reflect the aforementioned excluded items further noi may not be comparable to that of other real estate investment trusts as they may use different methodologies for calculating noi the following reconciles noi to net income for 2006 in thousands

healthcare sectors and property types 

we have investments in senior housing facilities medical office buildings hospitals skilled nursing facilities and other healthcare facilities certain tenants of our properties are reliant on government reimbursements such as those from medicare and medicaid see “governmental regulation” for the potential impact on the value of our investments and our results of operations the following describes the nature of the operations of our tenants and borrowers 

senior housing facilities   we have interests in 337 senior housing facilities including four properties in unconsolidated joint ventures senior housing properties include ilfs alfs and ccrcs which cater to different segments of the elderly population based upon their needs services provided by our tenants in these facilities are primarily paid for by the residents directly or through private insurance and are less reliant on government reimbursement programs such as medicaid and medicare

·   independent living facilities ilfs are designed to meet the needs of seniors who choose to live in an environment surrounded by their peers with services such as housekeeping meals and activities these residents generally do not need assistance with activities of daily living “adls” including bathing eating and dressing however residents have the option to contract for these services

·   assisted living facilities alfs are licensed care facilities that provide personal care services support and housing for those who need help with adls yet require limited medical care the programs and services may include transportation social activities exercise and fitness programs beauty or barber shop access hobby and craft activities community excursions meals in a dining room setting and other activities sought by residents these facilities are often in apartmentlike buildings with private residences ranging from single rooms to large apartments certain alfs may offer higher levels of personal assistance for residents with alzheimer’s disease or other forms of dementia levels of personal assistance are based in part on local regulations

·   continuing care retirement communities   ccrcs provide housing and healthrelated services under longterm contracts this alternative is appealing to residents as it eliminates the need for relocating when health and medical needs change thus allowing residents to “age in place” some ccrcs require a substantial entry fee or buyin fee and most also charge monthly maintenance fees in exchange for a living unit meals and some health services ccrcs typically require the individual to be in relatively good health and independent upon entry

medical office buildings   we have interests in 260 mobs including 14 properties owned by unconsolidated joint ventures these facilities typically contain physicians’ offices and examination rooms and may also include pharmacies hospital ancillary service space and outpatient services such as diagnostic centers rehabilitation clinics and daysurgery operating rooms while these facilities are similar to commercial office buildings they require more plumbing electrical and mechanical systems to accommodate multiple exam rooms that may require sinks in every room brighter lights and special equipment such as medical gases

hospitals   we have interests in 35 hospitals which include 13 acute care 11 rehabilitation four longterm acute care and seven specialty hospitals services provided by our tenants in these facilities are paid for by private sources thirdparty payors eg insurance and hmos or through the medicare and medicaid programs

·   acute care hospitals acute care hospitals offer a wide range of services such as fullyequipped operating and recovery rooms obstetrics radiology intensive care open heart surgery and coronary care neurosurgery neonatal intensive care magnetic resonance imaging nursing units oncology clinical laboratories respiratory therapy physical therapy nuclear medicine rehabilitation services and outpatient services

·   longterm acute care hospitals longterm acute care hospitals provide care for patients with complex medical conditions that require longer stays and more intensive care monitoring or emergency backup than that available in most skilled nursingbased programs

·   specialty hospitals  specialty hospitals are licensed as acute care hospitals but focus on providing care in specific areas such as cardiac orthopedic and women’s conditions or specific procedures such as surgery and are less likely to provide emergency services

·   rehabilitation hospitals rehabilitation hospitals provide inpatient and outpatient care for patients who have sustained traumatic injuries or illnesses such as spinal cord injuries strokes head injuries orthopedic problems workrelated disabilities and neurological diseases

skilled nursing facilities   we have interests in 69 snfs snfs offer restorative rehabilitative and custodial nursing care for people not requiring the more extensive and sophisticated treatment available at hospitals ancillary revenues and revenue from subacute care services are derived from providing services to residents beyond room and board and include occupational physical speech respiratory and intravenous therapy wound care oncology treatment brain injury care and orthopedic therapy as well as sales of pharmaceutical products and other services certain skilled nursing facilities provide some of the foregoing services on an outpatient basis skilled nursing services provided by our tenants in these facilities are primarily paid for either by private sources or through the medicare and medicaid programs

other healthcare facilities   we have investments in 30 healthcare laboratory and biotech research facilities these facilities are designed to accommodate research and development in the biopharmaceutical industry drug discovery and development and predictive and personalized medicine our investments include physician group practice clinic facilities health and wellness centers and facilities used for other healthcare purposes the physician group practice clinics generally provide a broad range of medical services through organized physician groups representing various medical specialties health and wellness centers provide testing and preventative health maintenance services

investment products 

owned and joint venture property investments 

the company holds its investments as wholly owned or in the form of unconsolidated joint ventures with thirdparty investors as of december 31 2006 we had investments in 731 properties including 18 properties through joint ventures whether owned wholly or through joint ventures the owned properties may be characterized as one of three types triplenet leased property operating property or development property 

triplenet leased properties 

triplenet leased properties are primarily singletenant buildings leased to a healthcare provider under a triplenet lease pursuant to triplenet leases tenants pay base rent and all operating expenses incurred at the property including utilities property taxes insurance and repairs and maintenance certain leases contain annual base rent escalations based on a predetermined fixed rate an inflation index or some other factor other leases may require tenants to pay additional rent based upon the operator’s achievement of specific performance thresholds the amount of additional rent may be based on a percentage of the facility’s revenues in excess of revenues for a specific base period or on the funds available for lease payment after base rent and operating expenses as of december 31 2006 the weighted average remaining term excluding unexercised renewal options on our triplenet leased properties is approximately 11 years 

we typically require credit enhancements to cover short falls in the event the tenant does not generate enough cash flow to pay rent the ability of certain senior housing lessees to satisfy their obligations under leases acquired from crp depends primarily on the properties’ operating results some of these leases have credit enhancements that have either expired or will expire either by the passage of time or upon the full utilization of the credit enhancement in addition the terms of certain leases acquired in the crp acquisition also provide for the tenant to maintain reserves to fund expenditures to refurbish buildings premises and equipment to maintain the facilities in a manner that allows for the operation of the facilities for their intended purpose to the extent the credit enhancements or reserves are inadequate the tenant may not be able to make rent payments to us when due or we may be required to fund such amounts 

the first year annual base rental rates on properties we acquired during 2006 ranged from 68 to 90 of the purchase price of the property rental rates vary by lease taking into consideration many factors including 

·   creditworthiness of the tenant

·   operating performance of the facility

·   credit support arrangements

·   cost of capital at the inception of the lease

·   location type and physical condition of the facility

·   barriers to entry such as certificates of need competitive development and constraining high land costs and

·   lease term

operating properties 

our operating properties are typically multitenant medical office buildings that are leased to multiple healthcare providers hospitals and physician practices under a gross modified gross or net lease structure under a gross or modified gross lease all or a portion of operating expenses are not reimbursed by tenants most of our owned mobs are managed by thirdparty property management companies and 21 are leased on a net basis while 239 are leased to multiple tenants under gross or modified gross leases pursuant to which we are responsible for certain operating expenses regardless of lease structure most of our leases at operating properties include annual base rent escalation clauses that are either predetermined fixed increases or are a function of an inflation index and typically have an initial term ranging from one to 15 years with a weighted average remaining term of approximately five years as of december 31 2006 

the following table reflects the annual reduction in revenue based on 2007 contractual lease payments for owned triplenet leased and operating properties resulting from lease expirations absent the impact of renewals if any in thousands 

 

1   excludes direct financing leases assets classified as held for contribution and assets held for sale and classified as discontinued operations

development properties 

we generally commit to development projects only if they are at least 50 preleased we use internal and external construction management expertise to evaluate local market conditions construction costs and other factors to seek appropriate riskadjusted returns during 2006 we completed and placed into service approximately 36 million of development properties 

investment management platform 

we coinvest in real estate with institutional investors through partnerships limited liability companies and joint ventures we target investors with longterm investment horizons who seek to benefit from our expertise in healthcare real estate typically we retain interests in the ventures ranging from 20 to 35 and serve as the managing member our coinvestment ventures generally allow us to earn acquisition fees asset management fees or priority distributions and have the potential for promoted interests or incentive distributions based on performance of the venture on october 27 2006 and january 5 2007 a total of 13 billion in medical office and senior housing assets were placed into joint ventures 

investments in secured loans direct financing leases and debt securities 

we have investments in 10 mortgage loans secured by 11 properties that are owned and operated by 9 healthcare providers our secured loan investments typically consist of senior mortgages or mezzanine financing on individual properties or a pool of properties at december 31 2006 the carrying amount of these mortgage loans totaled 1215 million the interest rates on mortgage loans outstanding at 

december 31 2006 ranged from 75 to 135 per annum our mortgage loans generally include prepayment penalties or yield maintenance provisions 

at december 31 2006 we had investments in 32 properties that are accounted for under direct financing leases with original terms that range from five to 35 years certain leases contain provisions that allow the tenants to elect to purchase the properties during or at the end of the lease terms for the aggregate initial investment amount plus adjustments if any as defined in the lease agreements 

we also have investments in senior secured second lien notes of hca inc which are classified as debt securities and are recorded at fair value at december 31 2006 the fair value of these senior secured notes was 3225 million and they are classified as available for sale these notes accrue interest at a rate of 9625 mature in 2016 and are secured by secondpriority liens on hca’s and its subsidiary guarantors’ assets the issuer of these notes may elect to pay interest in cash by increasing the principal amount of the notes for the entire amount of the interest payments or by paying half of the interest in cash and half in additional notes the first payment due on may 15 2007 is payable only in cash after november 15 2011 all interest on these notes will be payable in cash if the issuer elects to pay with additional principal amounts or additional notes the accrual rate is at 10375 

operator concentration 

the following table provides information about the concentration of business with our top five operators for the year ended december 31 2006 dollars in thousands 

 

1   represents the carrying amount of real estate assets including intangibles after adding back accumulated depreciation and amortization

2   106 properties managed by sunrise and six properties managed by brookdale were acquired from crp on october 5 2006

all of our properties associated with the aforementioned operators are primarily under triplenet leases these operators excluding summerville are subject to the informational filing requirements of the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended and are required to file periodic reports with the securities and exchange commission financial and other information relating to these operators may be obtained from their public reports 

according to public disclosures by tenet and sunrise these companies are experiencing various legal financial and regulatory difficulties we cannot predict with certainty the impact if any of the outcome of these uncertainties on their financial condition the failure or inability of these operators to pay their obligations could materially reduce our revenues net income and cash flows which could in turn reduce the amount of cash available for the payment of dividends cause our stock price to decline and cause us to incur impairment charges or a loss on the sale of the properties 

one of our hospitals located in tarzana california is operated by tenet and is affected by state of california senate bill 1953 which requires certain seismic safety building standards for acute care hospital facilities see “government regulation—california senate bill 1953” for more information

taxation of hcp 

we believe that we have operated in such a manner as to qualify for taxation as a reit under sections 856 to 860 of the internal revenue code of 1986 as amended the “code” commencing with our taxable year ended december 31 1985 and we intend to continue to operate in such a manner no assurance can be given that we have operated or will be able to continue to operate in a manner so as to qualify or to remain so qualified this summary is qualified in its entirety by the applicable code provisions rules and regulations promulgated thereunder and administrative and judicial interpretations thereof 

if we qualify for taxation as a reit we will generally not be required to pay federal corporate income taxes on the portion of our net income that is currently distributed to stockholders this treatment substantially eliminates the “double taxation” ie at the corporate and stockholder levels that generally 

results from investment in a corporation however we will be required to pay federal income tax under certain circumstances 

the code defines a reit as a corporation trust or association i which is managed by one or more trustees or directors ii the beneficial ownership of which is evidenced by transferable shares or by transferable certificates of beneficial interest iii which would be taxable but for sections 856 through 860 of the code as a domestic corporation iv which is neither a financial institution nor an insurance company subject to certain provisions of the code v the beneficial ownership of which is held by 100 or more persons vi during the last half of each taxable year not more than 50 in value of the outstanding stock of which is owned actually or constructively by five or fewer individuals and vii which meets certain other tests described below regarding the amount of its distributions and the nature of its income and assets the code provides that conditions i to iv inclusive must be met during the entire taxable year and that condition v must be met during at least 335 days of a taxable year of 12 months or during a proportionate part of a taxable year of less than 12 months 

there are presently two gross income requirements first at least 75 of our gross income excluding gross income from “prohibited transactions” as defined below for each taxable year must be derived directly or indirectly from investments relating to real property or mortgages on real property or from certain types of temporary investment income second at least 95 of our gross income excluding gross income from prohibited transactions for each taxable year must be derived from income that qualifies under the 75 test and all other dividends interest and gain from the sale or other disposition of stock or securities a “prohibited transaction” is a sale or other disposition of property other than foreclosure property held for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business 

at the close of each quarter of our taxable year we must also satisfy four tests relating to the nature of our assets first at least 75 of the value of our total assets must be represented by real estate assets certain stock or debt instruments purchased with the proceeds of a stock offering or long term public debt offering by us but only for the oneyear period after such offering cash cash items and government securities second not more than 25 of our total assets may be represented by securities other than those in the 75 asset class third of the investments included in the 25 asset class the value of any one issuer’s securities owned by us may not exceed 5 of the value of our total assets and we may not own more than 10 of the vote or value of the securities of a nonreit corporation other than certain debt securities and interests in taxable reit subsidiaries or qualified reit subsidiaries each as defined below fourth not more than 20 of the value of our total assets may be represented by securities of one or more taxable reit subsidiaries 

we own interests in various partnerships and limited liability companies in the case of a reit that is a partner in a partnership or a member of a limited liability company that is treated as a partnership under the code treasury regulations provide that for purposes of the reit income and asset tests the reit will be deemed to own its proportionate share of the assets of the partnership or limited liability company determined in accordance with its capital interest in the entity subject to special rules related to the 10 asset test and will be deemed to be entitled to the income of the partnership or limited liability company attributable to such share the ownership of an interest in a partnership or limited liability company by a reit may involve special tax risks including the challenge by the internal revenue service the “service” of the allocations of income and expense items of the partnership or limited liability company which would affect the computation of taxable income of the reit and the status of the partnership or limited liability company as a partnership as opposed to an association taxable as a corporation for federal income tax purposes 

we also own interests in a number of subsidiaries which are intended to be treated as qualified reit subsidiaries each a “qrs” the code provides that such subsidiaries will be ignored for federal income tax purposes and all assets liabilities and items of income deduction and credit of such subsidiaries will be 

treated as our assets liabilities and such items if any partnership limited liability company or subsidiary in which we own an interest were treated as a regular corporation and not as a partnership qrs or taxable reit subsidiary as the case may be for federal income tax purposes we would likely fail to satisfy the reit asset tests described above and would therefore fail to qualify as a reit unless certain relief provisions apply we believe that each of the partnerships limited liability companies and subsidiaries other than taxable reit subsidiaries in which we own an interest will be treated for tax purposes as a partnership or disregarded entity in the case of a 100 owned partnership or limited liability company or qrs as applicable although no assurance can be given that the service will not successfully challenge the status of any such organization 

as of december 31 2006 we owned interests in two subsidiaries which are intended to be treated as taxable reit subsidiaries each a “trs” a reit may own any percentage of the voting stock and value of the securities of a corporation which jointly elects with the reit to be a trs provided certain requirements are met a trs generally may engage in any business including the provision of customary or noncustomary services to tenants of its parent reit and of others except a trs may not manage or operate a hotel or healthcare facility a trs is treated as a regular corporation and is subject to federal income tax and applicable state income and franchise taxes at regular corporate rates in addition a 100 tax may be imposed on a reit if its rental service or other agreements with its trs or the trs’s agreements with the reit’s tenants are not on arm’slength terms 

in order to qualify as a reit we are required to distribute dividends other than capital gain dividends to our stockholders in an amount at least equal to a the sum of i 90 of our “real estate investment trust taxable income” computed without regard to the dividends paid deduction and our net capital gain and ii 90 of the net income if any after tax from foreclosure property minus b the sum of certain items of noncash income such distributions must be paid in the taxable year to which they relate or in the following taxable year if declared before we timely file our tax return for such year if paid on or before the first regular dividend payment date after such declaration and if we so elect and specify the dollar amount in our tax return to the extent that we do not distribute all of our net longterm capital gain or distribute at least 90 but less than 100 of our “real estate investment trust taxable income” as adjusted we will be required to pay tax thereon at regular corporate tax rates furthermore if we should fail to distribute during each calendar year at least the sum of i 85 of our ordinary income for such year ii 95 of our capital gain income for such year and iii any undistributed taxable income from prior periods we would be required to pay a 4 excise tax on the excess of such required distributions over the amounts actually distributed 

if we fail to qualify for taxation as a reit in any taxable year and certain relief provisions do not apply we will be required to pay tax including any applicable alternative minimum tax on our taxable income at regular corporate rates distributions to stockholders in any year in which we fail to qualify will not be deductible by us nor will they be required to be made unless entitled to relief under specific statutory provisions we will also be disqualified from taxation as a reit for the four taxable years following the year during which qualification was lost it is not possible to state whether in all circumstances we would be entitled to the statutory relief failure to qualify for even one year could substantially reduce distributions to stockholders and could result in our incurring substantial indebtedness to the extent borrowings are feasible or liquidating substantial investments in order to pay the resulting taxes 

we and our stockholders may be required to pay state or local tax in various state or local jurisdictions including those in which we or they transact business or reside the state and local tax treatment of us and our stockholders may not conform to the federal income tax consequences discussed above 

we may also be subject to certain taxes applicable to reits including taxes in lieu of disqualification as a reit on undistributed income on income from prohibited transactions on net income from foreclosure property and on builtin gains from the sale of certain assets acquired from c corporations in taxfree transactions 

government regulation 

the healthcare industry is heavily regulated by federal state and local laws this government regulation of the healthcare industry affects us because 

1   governmental regulations such as licensure certification for participation in government programs and government reimbursement may impact the financial ability of some of our operators to make rent and debt payments to us which in turn may affect the value of our investments and

2   the amount of reimbursement such operators receive from the government and other third parties may affect the amounts we receive in additional rents which are often based on our operators’ gross revenue from operations

these laws and regulations are subject to frequent and substantial changes resulting from legislation adoption of rules and regulations and administrative and judicial interpretations of existing law these changes may have a dramatic effect on the definition of permissible or impermissible activities the relative costs associated with doing business and the amount of reimbursement by government and other thirdparty payors these changes may be applied retroactively the ultimate timing or effect of these changes cannot be predicted the failure of any tenant or borrower to comply with such laws regulations and requirements could affect its ability to operate its facility or facilities and could adversely affect such operator’s ability to make lease or debt payments to us which in turn may affect the value of our investments 

fraud and abuse laws   there are various federal and state laws prohibiting fraud and abusive business practices by healthcare providers who participate in receive payments from or are in a position to make referrals in connection with a governmentsponsored healthcare program including but not limited to the medicare and medicaid programs these include

·   the federal antikickback statute which prohibits among other things the offer payment solicitation or receipt of any form of remuneration in return for or to induce the referral of medicare and medicaid patients

·   the federal physician selfreferral prohibition stark which restricts physicians from making referrals for certain designated health services for which payment may be made under medicare or medicaid programs to an entity with which the physician or an immediate family member has a financial relationship

·   the false claims act which prohibits any person from knowingly presenting false or fraudulent claims for payment to the federal government including the medicare and medicaid programs

·   the civil monetary penalties law which is imposed by the department of health and human services for fraudulent acts

each of these laws include criminal andor civil penalties for violations that range from punitive sanctions damage assessments penalties imprisonment denial of medicare and medicaid payments andor exclusion from the medicare and medicaid programs imposition of any of these types of penalties on our tenants or borrowers could result in a material adverse effect on their operations which could adversely affect our business additionally certain laws such as the false claims act allow for individuals to bring qui tam whistleblower actions on behalf of the government for violations of fraud and abuse 

laws some medicare administrative contractors private companies that contract with centers for medicare  medicaid services “cms” to administer the medicare program have also increased scrutiny of cost reports filed by skilled nursing providers 

environmental matters   a wide variety of federal state and local environmental and occupational health and safety laws and regulations affect healthcare facility operations under various federal state and local environmental laws ordinances and regulations an owner of real property or a secured lender such as us may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of hazardous or toxic substances at under or disposed of in connection with such property as well as other potential costs relating to hazardous or toxic substances including government fines and damages for injuries to persons and adjacent property the cost of any required remediation removal fines or personal or property damages and the owner’s or secured lender’s liability therefore could exceed the value of the property andor the assets of the owner or secured lender in addition the presence of such substances or the failure to properly dispose of or remediate such substances may adversely affect the owner’s ability to sell or rent such property or to borrow using such property as collateral which in turn would reduce our revenue although the mortgage loans that we provide and the leases covering our properties require the borrower and the tenant to indemnify us for certain environmental liabilities the scope of such obligations may be limited and we cannot assure that any such borrower or tenant would be able to fulfill its indemnification obligations

the medicare and medicaid programs   sources of revenue for operators may include the federal medicare program state medicaid programs private insurance carriers healthcare service plans and health maintenance organizations among others efforts to reduce costs by these payors will likely continue which may result in reduced or slower growth in reimbursement for certain services provided by some of our operators in addition the failure of any of our operators to comply with various laws and regulations could jeopardize their certification and ability to continue to participate in the medicare and medicaid programs medicaid programs differ from state to state but they are all subject to federallyimposed requirements at least 50 of the funds available under these programs are provided by the federal government under a matching program medicaid programs generally pay for acute and rehabilitative care based on reasonable costs at fixed rates skilled nursing facilities are generally reimbursed using fixed daily rates medicaid payments are generally below retail rates for tenantoperated facilities and the deficit reduction act of 2005 may further reduce medicaid reimbursement as the act included cuts of approximately 48 billion over five years to the medicaid program increasingly states have introduced managed care contracting techniques into the administration of medicaid programs such mechanisms could have the impact of reducing utilization of and reimbursement to facilities other thirdparty payors in various states base payments on costs retail rates or increasingly negotiated rates negotiated rates can include discounts from normal charges fixed daily rates and prepaid capitated rates

healthcare facilities   the healthcare facilities in our portfolio including hospitals skilled nursing facilities assisted living facilities and physician group practice clinics are subject to extensive federal state and local licensure certification and inspection laws and regulations failure to comply with any of these laws could result in loss of accreditation denial of reimbursement imposition of fines suspension or decertification from federal and state healthcare programs loss of license or closure of the facility such actions may have an effect on the revenue of the operators of properties owned by or mortgaged to us and therefore adversely impact us

entrance fee communities   certain of the senior housing facilities mortgaged to or owned by us are operated as entrance fee communities generally an entrance fee is an upfront fee or consideration paid by a resident a portion of which may be refundable in exchange for some form of longterm benefit some of the entrance fee communities are subject to significant state regulatory oversight including for example oversight of each facility’s financial condition establishment and monitoring of reserve requirements and other financial restrictions the right of residents to cancel their contracts within a 

specified period of time lien rights in favor of the residents restrictions on change of ownership and similar matters such oversight and the rights of residents within these entrance fee communities may have an effect on the revenue or operations of the operators of such facilities and therefore may adversely impact us 

california senate bill 1953   our hospital located in tarzana california is affected by state of california senate bill 1953 sb 1953 which requires certain seismic safety building standards for acute care hospital facilities this hospital is operated by tenet under a lease expiring in february 2009 we and tenet are currently reviewing the sb 1953 compliance of this hospital multiple plans of action to cause such compliance the estimated time for completing the same and the cost of performing necessary remediation of the property we cannot currently estimate the remediation costs that will need to be incurred prior to 2013 in order to make the facility sb 1953compliant through 2030 or the final allocation of any remediation costs between us and tenet rent on the hospital in 2006 and 2005 was 108 million in each year and the carrying amount of the facility is 739 million at december 31 2006

current developments 

the healthcare industry continues to face various challenges including increased government and private payor pressure on healthcare providers to control costs the migration of patients from acute care facilities into extended care and home care settings and the vertical and horizontal consolidation of healthcare providers 

changes in the law new interpretations of existing laws and changes in payment methodologies may have a dramatic effect on the definition of permissible or impermissible activities the relative costs associated with doing business and the amount of reimbursement furnished by government and other thirdparty payors these changes may be applied retroactively under certain circumstances the ultimate timing or effect of legislative efforts cannot be predicted and may impact us in different ways 

in december of 2003 the medicare prescription drug improvement and modernization act of 2003 the “act” was signed into law the act established an 18month moratorium on the “whole hospital exception” to the stark law whereby physicians have been permitted to refer patients for designated health services to hospitals in which they have an ownership interest on august 8 2006 cms released its final report and plan to address issues relating to physician investment in specialty hospitals specialty hospitals include hospitals primarily or exclusively engaged in the care and treatment of cardiac conditions or orthopedic conditions or hospitals that perform certain surgical procedures cms’ strategic plan includes strict enforcement of federal fraud and abuse laws for improper investments disclosure of information regarding physician investment and compensation arrangements acceptance of emergency transfer cases even if the specialty hospital lacks an emergency department and changes to the hospital inpatient prospective and ambulatory surgical center payment systems cms declined to extend the moratorium on approving new specialty hospitals despite a request for an extension by two senators in light of continued interest in specialty hospital regulation there is a risk that legislation could be adopted that affects the operation of specialty hospitals the specialty hospital issue is controversial and after significant discussion and legislation the current federal government permitted operation of specialty hospitals however there can be no assurance that a new congress or administration would continue similar treatment of specialty hospitals our hospital tenants may face additional competition from an increased number of specialty hospitals including specialty hospitals owned by physicians currently on staff at tenant hospitals 

in addition to the reforms enacted and considered by congress from time to time state legislatures periodically consider various healthcare reform proposals congress and state legislatures can be expected to continue to review and assess alternative healthcare delivery systems new regulatory enforcement initiatives and new payment methodologies 

we believe that government and private efforts to contain or reduce healthcare costs will continue these trends are likely to lead to reduced or slower growth in reimbursement for certain services provided by some of our operators in addition recent trends of hospitals providing more services to uninsured patients or on an outpatient basis rather than inpatient basis may continue and could adversely affect the profitability of our operators we believe that the vast nature of the healthcare industry the financial strength and operating flexibility of our operators and the diversity of our portfolio will mitigate the impact of any such trends however we cannot predict what legislation will be adopted and no assurance can be given that the healthcare reforms will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 

employees 

at december 31 2006 we had 165 fulltime employees and no parttime employees none of whom are subject to a collective bargaining agreement we consider our relations with our employees to be good 




 item 1a   risk factors 

you should carefully consider the risks described below as well as the risks described in “competition” “government regulation” and “taxation of hcp” and elsewhere in this report which risks are incorporated by reference into this section before making an investment decision regarding our company the risks and uncertainties described herein are not the only ones facing us and there may be additional risks that we do not presently know of or that we currently consider not likely to have a significant impact all of these risks could adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

risks related to our operators 

if our facility operators are unable to operate our properties in a manner sufficient to generate income they may be unable to make rent and loan payments to us 

the healthcare industry is highly competitive and we expect that it may become more competitive in the future our operators are subject to competition from other healthcare providers that provide similar services such competition which has intensified due to overbuilding in some segments in which we operate has caused the fillup rate of newly constructed buildings to slow and the monthly rate that many newly built and previously existing facilities were able to obtain for their services to decrease the profitability of healthcare facilities depends upon several factors including the number of physicians using the healthcare facilities or referring patients there competitive systems of healthcare delivery and the size and composition of the population in the surrounding area private federal and state payment programs and the effect of other laws and regulations may also have a significant influence on the revenues and income of the properties if our operators are not competitive with other healthcare providers and are unable to generate income they may be unable to make rent and loan payments to us which could adversely affect our cash flow and financial performance and condition 

the bankruptcy insolvency or financial deterioration of our facility operators could significantly delay our ability to collect unpaid rents or require us to find new operators 

our financial position and our ability to make distributions to our stockholders may be adversely affected by financial difficulties experienced by any of our major operators including bankruptcy insolvency or a general downturn in the business or in the event any of our major operators do not renew or extend their relationship with us as their lease terms expire 

we are exposed to the risk that our operators may not be able to meet their obligations which may result in their bankruptcy or insolvency although our leases and loans provide us the right to terminate an investment evict an operator demand immediate repayment and other remedies the bankruptcy laws 

afford certain rights to a party that has filed for bankruptcy or reorganization an operator in bankruptcy may be able to restrict our ability to collect unpaid rents or interest during the bankruptcy proceeding 

tenet healthcare corporation and sunrise senior living account for a significant percentage of our revenues and are currently experiencing significant legal financial and regulatory difficulties 

during 2006 tenet healthcare corporation and sunrise senior living accounted for approximately 9 and 5 respectively of our revenues the properties managed by sunrise were acquired from crp on october 5 2006 according to public disclosures tenet and sunrise are experiencing significant legal financial and regulatory difficulties we cannot predict with certainty the impact if any of the outcome of these uncertainties on our consolidated financial statements the failure or inability of tenet or sunrise to pay its obligations could materially reduce our revenue net income and cash flows which could adversely affect the value of our common stock and could cause us to incur impairment charges or a loss on the sale of the properties 

our operators are faced with increased litigation and rising insurance costs that may affect their ability to make their lease or mortgage payments 

in some states advocacy groups have been created to monitor the quality of care at healthcare facilities and these groups have brought litigation against operators also in several instances private litigation by patients has succeeded in winning very large damage awards for alleged abuses the effect of this litigation and potential litigation has been to materially increase the costs incurred by our operators for monitoring and reporting quality of care compliance in addition the cost of liability and medical malpractice insurance has increased and may continue to increase so long as the present litigation environment affecting the operations of healthcare facilities continues continued cost increases could cause our operators to be unable to make their lease or mortgage payments potentially decreasing our revenue and increasing our collection and litigation costs moreover to the extent we are required to take back the affected facilities our revenue from those facilities could be reduced or eliminated for an extended period of time 

decline in the skilled nursing sector and changes to medicare and medicaid reimbursement rates may have significant adverse consequences to us 

during 2006 our skilled nursing properties accounted for approximately 7 of our revenues certain of our skilled nursing operators and facilities continue to experience operating problems in part due to a national nursing shortage increased liability insurance costs and low levels of medicare and medicaid reimbursement due to economic challenges facing many states nursing homes will likely continue to be underfunded these challenges have had and may continue to have an adverse effect on our longterm care facilities and facility operators 

we may rely on credit enhancements to our leases for minimum rent payments 

our leases may have credit enhancement provisions such as guarantees or shortfall reserves provided by tenants or operators these credit enhancement provisions may terminate at either a specific time during the lease term or once net operating income of the property exceeds a specified amount these provisions may also have limits on the overall amount of the credit enhancement after the termination of a credit enhancement or in the event that the maximum limit of a credit enhancement is reached we may only look to the tenant to make lease payments in the event that a credit enhancement has expired or the maximum limit has been reached or in the event that a provider of a credit enhancement is unable to meet its obligations our results of operations and our cash available for distribution could be adversely affected if our properties are unable to generate sufficient funds from operations to meet minimum rent payments and the tenants do not otherwise have the resources to make the rent payments our tenants may be thinly 

capitalized entities that rely on the cash flow generated from the properties to fund rent obligations under their lease 

risks related to real estate investment and our structure 

we rely on external sources of capital to fund future capital needs and if our access to such capital is difficult or on commercially unreasonable terms we may not be able to meet maturing commitments or make future investments necessary to grow our business 

in order to qualify as a reit under the internal revenue code we are required among other things to distribute to our stockholders each year at least 90 of our reit taxable income because of this distribution requirement we may not be able to fund all future capital needs including capital needs in connection with acquisitions from cash retained from operations as a result we rely on external sources of capital if we are unable to obtain needed capital at all or only on unfavorable terms from these sources we might not be able to make the investments needed to grow our business or to meet our obligations and commitments as they mature which could negatively affect the ratings of our debt and even in extreme circumstances affect our ability to continue operations our access to capital depends upon a number of factors over which we have little or no control including 

·   general market conditions

·   the market’s perception of our growth potential

·   our current and potential future earnings and cash distributions and

·   the market price of the shares of our capital stock

if we are unable to identify and purchase suitable healthcare facilities at a favorable cost we will be unable to continue to grow through acquisitions 

our ability to grow through acquisitions is integral to our business strategy and requires us to identify suitable acquisition candidates that meet our criteria and are compatible with our growth strategy the acquisition and financing of healthcare facilities at favorable costs is highly competitive we may not be successful in identifying suitable property or other assets that meet our acquisition criteria or in consummating acquisitions on satisfactory terms or at all if we cannot identify and purchase a sufficient quantity of healthcare facilities at favorable prices or if we are unable to finance such acquisitions on commercially favorable terms our business will suffer 

unforeseen costs associated with the acquisition of new properties could reduce our profitability 

our business strategy contemplates future acquisitions the acquisitions we make may not prove to be successful we might encounter unanticipated difficulties and expenditures relating to any acquired properties including contingent liabilities further newly acquired properties might require significant management attention that would otherwise be devoted to our ongoing business we might never realize the anticipated benefits of an acquisition which could adversely affect our profitability 

since real estate investments are illiquid we may not be able to sell properties when we desire 

real estate investments generally cannot be sold quickly we may not be able to vary our portfolio promptly in response to changes in the real estate market this inability to respond to changes in the performance of our investments could adversely affect our ability to service our debt the real estate market is affected by many factors that are beyond our control including 

·   adverse changes in national and local economic and market conditions

·   changes in interest rates and in the availability costs and terms of financing

·   changes in governmental laws and regulations fiscal policies and zoning and other ordinances and costs of compliance with laws and regulations

·   the ongoing need for capital improvements particularly in older structures

·   changes in operating expenses and

·   civil unrest acts of war and natural disasters including earthquakes and floods which may result in uninsured and underinsured losses

we cannot predict whether we will be able to sell any property for the price or on the terms set by us or whether any price or other terms offered by a prospective purchaser would be acceptable to us we also cannot predict the length of time needed to find a willing purchaser and to close the sale of a property in addition there are provisions under the federal income tax laws applicable to reits that may limit our ability to recognize the full economic benefit from a sale of our assets these factors and any others that would impede our ability to respond to adverse changes in the performance of our properties could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition 

transfers of healthcare facilities generally require regulatory approvals and alternative uses of healthcare facilities are limited 

because transfers of healthcare facilities may be subject to regulatory approvals not required for transfers of other types of commercial operations and other types of real estate there may be delays in transferring operations of our facilities to successor operators or we may be prohibited from transferring operations to a successor operator in addition substantially all of our properties are healthcare facilities that may not be easily adapted to nonhealthcarerelated uses if we are unable to transfer properties at times opportune to us our revenue and operations may suffer 

we may experience uninsured or underinsured losses 

we generally require our operators to secure and maintain comprehensive liability and property insurance that covers us as well as the operators on most of our properties some types of losses however either may be uninsurable or too expensive to insure against should an uninsured loss or a loss in excess of insured limits occur we could lose all or a portion of the capital we have invested in a property as well as the anticipated future revenue from the property in such an event we might nevertheless remain obligated for any mortgage debt or other financial obligations related to the property we cannot assure you that material losses in excess of insurance proceeds will not occur in the future 

increases in interest rates may increase our interest expense and adversely affect our cash flow and our ability to service our indebtedness 

at december 31 2006 our total consolidated indebtedness was approximately 62 billion of which approximately 17 billion or 27 is subject to variable interest rates this variable rate debt had a weighted average interest rate of approximately 61 per annum increases in interest rates on this variable rate debt would increase our interest expense which could harm our cash flow and our ability to service our indebtedness 

our acquisition of additional properties may have an adverse effect on our business liquidity financial position credit ratings andor results of operations 

as part of our business strategy we actively acquire healthcare facilities our recent acquisition of crp and crc is an example of the execution of this strategy we may acquire healthcare facilities through various structures including transactions involving portfolios single assets joint ventures and acquisitions of all or substantially all of the securities or assets of other reits or similar real estate entities we 

anticipate that our acquisitions will be financed through a combination of methods including proceeds from equity andor debt offerings advances under our credit facilities and other incurrence or assumption of indebtedness any significant acquisition or series of acquisitions financed by incurrence of indebtedness may cause us to become highly leveraged andor have a negative impact on the credit ratings of our senior debt and preferred stock additionally newly acquired properties may fail to perform as expected inaccurate assumptions regarding future rental or occupancy rates could result in overly optimistic estimates of future revenues similarly we may underestimate future operating expenses or the costs necessary to bring an acquired property up to standards established for its intended market position 

if we are unable to successfully integrate the operations of crp and other target companies our business and earnings may be negatively affected 

mergers involve the integration of companies that have previously operated independently successful integration of the operations of these companies depend primarily on our ability to consolidate operations systems procedures properties and personnel and to eliminate redundancies and costs mergers also pose other risks commonly associated with similar transactions including unanticipated liabilities unexpected costs and the diversion of management’s attention to the integration of our operations with those of the target companies we cannot assure you that we will be able to integrate crp or other target companies’ operations without encountering difficulties including but not limited to the loss of key employees the disruption of its respective ongoing businesses or possible inconsistencies in standards controls procedures and policies estimated cost savings are projected to come from various areas that our management has identified through the due diligence and integration planning process if we have difficulties with any of these areas we might not achieve the economic benefits we expect to result from the merger and this may hurt our business and earnings in addition we may experience greater than expected costs or difficulties relating to the integration of the business of crp or other target companies andor may not realize expected cost savings from mergers within the expected time frame if at all 

our business could be adversely impacted if we have deficiencies in our disclosure controls and procedures or internal control over financial reporting 

the design and effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting may not prevent all errors misstatements or misrepresentations while management will continue to review the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting there can be no guarantee that our internal control over financial reporting will be effective in accomplishing all control objectives all of the time in certain circumstances the effectiveness of internal controls is dependent on information received from independent third parties for example we consolidate our investments in certain variable interest entities “vies” when it is determined that we are the primary beneficiary of the vie if management of the consolidated vies fails to provide us necessary financial information either in a timely manner or at all it could adversely impact our financial reporting and our internal controls over financial reporting deficiencies including any material weakness in our internal controls over financial reporting which may occur in the future could result in misstatements of our results of operations restatements of our financial statements a decline in our stock price or otherwise materially adversely affect our business reputation results of operations financial condition or liquidity 

we lease 76 properties to a total of 9 tenants that have been identified as vies we acquired these leases variable interests on october 5 2006 in our acquisition of crp crp determined they were not the primary beneficiary of the vies and we are generally required to carry forward crp’s accounting conclusions after the acquisition relative to their primary beneficiary assessment we may need to reassess whether we are the primary beneficiary in the future upon the occurrence of a reconsideration event as defined by fin 46r if we determine that we are the primary beneficiary in the future and consolidate the 

tenant our financial statements would reflect the tenant’s facility level revenues and expenses rather than lease revenue 

federal income tax risks 

loss of our tax status as a reit would have significant adverse consequences to us 

we currently operate and have operated commencing with our taxable year ended december 31 1985 in a manner that is intended to allow us to qualify as a reit for federal income tax purposes under the internal revenue code of 1986 as amended 

qualification as a reit involves the application of highly technical and complex internal revenue code provisions for which there are only limited judicial and administrative interpretations the determination of various factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control may affect our ability to qualify as a reit for example in order to qualify as a reit at least 95 of our gross income in any year must be derived from qualifying sources and we must satisfy a number of requirements regarding the composition of our assets also we must make distributions to stockholders aggregating annually at least 90 of our reit taxable income excluding capital gains in addition new legislation regulations administrative interpretations or court decisions may adversely affect our investors or our ability to qualify as a reit for tax purposes although we believe that we have been organized and have operated in such manner we can give no assurance that we have qualified or will continue to qualify as a reit for tax purposes 

if we lose our reit status we will face serious tax consequences that will substantially reduce the funds available to make payments of principal and interest on the debt securities we issue and to make distributions to our stockholders if we fail to qualify as a reit 

·   we would not be allowed a deduction for distributions to stockholders in computing our taxable income and would be subject to federal income tax at regular corporate rates

·   we also could be subject to the federal alternative minimum tax and possibly increased state and local taxes and

·   unless we are entitled to relief under statutory provisions we could not elect to be subject to tax as a reit for four taxable years following the year during which we were disqualified

in addition if we fail to qualify as a reit all distributions to stockholders would be subject to tax as regular corporate dividends to the extent of our current and accumulated earnings and profits and we would not be required to make distributions to stockholders 

as a result of all these factors our failure to qualify as a reit also could impair our ability to expand our business and raise capital and could adversely affect the value of our common stock 

certain property transfers may generate prohibited transaction income resulting in a penalty tax on gain attributable to the transaction 

from time to time we may transfer or otherwise dispose of some of our properties under the internal revenue code any gain resulting from transfers of properties that we hold as inventory or primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business would be treated as income from a prohibited transaction subject to a 100 penalty tax since we acquire properties for investment purposes we do not believe that our occasional transfers or disposals of property are properly treated as prohibited transactions however whether property is held for investment purposes is a question of fact that depends on all the facts and circumstances surrounding the particular transaction the internal revenue service may contend that certain transfers or disposals of properties by us are prohibited transactions while we believe that the internal revenue service would not prevail in any such dispute if the internal revenue service were to argue successfully that a transfer or disposition of property constituted a prohibited transaction then we would be required to pay a 100 penalty tax on any gain allocable to us from the 

prohibited transaction in addition income from a prohibited transaction might adversely affect our ability to satisfy the income tests for qualification as a real estate investment trust for federal income tax purposes 

as a result of the crp merger and the crc merger we may have inherited tax liabilities and attributes from crp and crc 

prior to the crp merger crp was organized as a reit for federal income tax purposes if crp failed to qualify as a reit for any of its taxable years it would be required to pay federal income tax including any applicable alternative minimum tax on its taxable income at regular corporate rates unless statutory relief provisions apply crp would have been disqualified from treatment as a reit for the four taxable years following the year during which it lost qualification because the crp merger was treated for income tax purposes as if crp sold all of its assets in a taxable transaction to us if crp did not qualify as a reit for the taxable year of the merger it would be subject to tax in respect of the builtin gain in all of its assets “builtin gain” generally means the excess of the fair market value of an asset over its adjusted tax basis as successorininterest to crp we would be required to pay these taxes after the merger the nature of the assets that we acquired from crp and the income we derive from those assets may have an effect on our tax status as a reit 

in connection with the crp merger crp’s reit counsel rendered an opinion to us dated as of the closing date of the merger to the effect that crp qualified as a reit under the code for the taxable years ending december 31 1999 generally through december 31 2005 crp was organized in conformity with the requirements for qualification as a reit and crp’s method of operation had enabled crp to satisfy the requirements for qualification as a reit under the code for the taxable years ending on or prior to the closing date of the merger this opinion was based on various assumptions and representations as to factual matters including representations made by crp in a factual certificate provided by one of its officers as well as other oral and written statements of officers and other representatives of crp and others as to the existence and consequence of certain factual and other matters 

as a result of the crc merger we succeeded to the assets and the liabilities of crc including any liabilities for unpaid taxes and any tax liabilities created in connection with the crc merger at the closing of the crc merger we received an opinion of crc’s counsel and crc and its stockholders received an opinion of their counsel substantially to the effect that on the basis of the facts representations and assumptions set forth or referred to in such opinions for federal income tax purposes the crc merger qualified as a reorganization within the meaning of section 368a of the code to the extent that the crc merger so qualified no gain or loss was recognized by crc or us in the crc merger if the crc merger did not qualify as a reorganization within the meaning of section 368a of the code the crc merger would have been treated as a sale of crc’s assets to hcp in a taxable transaction and crc would have recognized taxable gain in such a case as crc’s successorininterest we would be required to pay the tax on any such gain 

assuming that the crc merger qualified as a reorganization under the code we succeeded to the tax attributes and earnings and profits of crc to qualify as a reit we must distribute such earnings and profits by the close of the taxable year in which the crc merger occurred any adjustments of crc’s income for taxable years ending on or before the crc merger including as a result of an examination of crc’s tax returns by the internal revenue service could affect the calculation of crc’s earnings and profits if the internal revenue service were to determine that we acquired earnings and profits from crc that we failed to distribute prior to the end of the taxable year in which the crc merger occurred we could avoid disqualification as a reit by using “deficiency dividend” procedures under these procedures we generally would be required to distribute any such earnings and profits to our stockholders within 90 days of the determination and pay a statutory interest charge at a specified rate to the internal revenue service 

the opinions of counsel delivered in connection with the crp merger and the crc merger represent the best legal judgment of counsel and are not binding on the internal revenue service or the courts none of us crp or crc has requested nor will request a ruling from the internal revenue service as to the status of crp as a reit or the tax consequences of the crc merger and there can be no assurance that the internal revenue service will agree with the conclusions in the abovedescribed opinions

executive summary 

we are a real estate investment trust “reit” that invests in healthcarerelated properties primarily located throughout the united states we develop acquire and manage healthcare real estate and provide mortgage financing to healthcare providers we invest directly often structuring saleleaseback transactions and through joint ventures at december 31 2006 our real estate portfolio excluding assets held for sale but including assets held through joint ventures and mortgage loans consisted of interests in 731 facilities 

our business strategy is based on three principles i opportunistic investing ii portfolio diversification and iii conservative financing we actively redeploy capital from investments with lower return potential into assets with higher return potential and recycle capital from shorterterm to longerterm investments we make investments where the expected riskadjusted return exceeds our cost of capital and strive to leverage our operator and other business relationships 

our strategy contemplates acquiring and developing properties on favorable terms we attempt to structure transactions that are taxadvantaged and mitigate risks in our underwriting process generally we prefer larger more complex private transactions that leverage our management team’s experience and our infrastructure in addition we follow a disciplined approach to enhancing the value of our existing portfolio including the ongoing evaluation of properties that no longer fit our strategy for potential disposition 

we primarily generate revenue by leasing healthcarerelated properties under longterm leases most of our rents and other earned income from leases are received under triplenet leases however mob rents are typically structured as gross or modified gross leases accordingly for mobs we incur certain property operating expenses such as real estate taxes repairs and maintenance property management fees utilities and insurance our growth depends in part on our ability to i increase rental income and other earned income from leases by increasing occupancy levels and rental rates ii maximize tenant recoveries given underlying lease structures and iii control operating and other expenses our operations are impacted by property specific market specific general economic and other conditions 

access to external capital on favorable terms is critical to the success of our strategy we attempt to match the longterm duration of our leases with longterm fixedrate financing at december 31 2006 27 of our consolidated debt is at variable interest rates which includes a 05 billion term loan that was used to pay the cash consideration of our merger with crp we repaid the remaining balance of the term loan with proceeds from our january 2007 capital market transactions which further reduced our variable interest rate exposure we intend to maintain an investment grade rating on our fixed income securities and manage various capital ratios and amounts within appropriate parameters as of december 31 2006 our senior debt is rated bbb by standard  poor’s ratings group bbb by fitch ratings and baa3 by moody’s investors service 

capital market access impacts our cost of capital and our ability to refinance existing indebtedness as it matures as well as to fund future acquisitions and development through the issuance of additional securities our ability to access capital on favorable terms is dependent on various factors including general market conditions interest rates credit ratings on our securities perception of our potential future earnings and cash distributions and the market price of our capital stock

critical accounting policies 

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” requires management to use judgment in the application of accounting policies including making estimates and assumptions we base estimates on our experience and on various other assumptions believed to be reasonable under the circumstances these estimates affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods if our judgment or interpretation of the facts and circumstances relating to various transactions or other matters had been different it is possible that different accounting would have been applied resulting in a different presentation of our financial statements from time to time we reevaluate our estimates and assumptions in the event estimates or assumptions prove to be different from actual results adjustments are made in subsequent periods to reflect more current estimates and assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain 

principles of consolidation 

our consolidated financial statements include the accounts of hcp its wholly owned subsidiaries and its controlled through voting rights or other means joint ventures all material intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation 

we have adopted interpretation no 46r consolidation of variable interest entities  as revised “fin 46r” effective january 1 2004 for variable interest entities created before february 1 2003 and effective in fiscal year 2003 for variable interest entities created after january 31 2003 fin 46r provides guidance on the identification of entities for which control is achieved through means other than voting rights “variable interest entities” or “vies” and the determination of which business enterprise is the primary beneficiary of the vie a variable interest entity is broadly defined as an entity where either i the equity investors as a group if any do not have a controlling financial interest or ii the equity investment at risk is insufficient to finance that entity’s activities without additional subordinated financial support we consolidate investments in vies when it is determined that we are the primary beneficiary of 

the vie at either the creation of the variable interest entity or upon the occurrence of a reconsideration event the adoption of fin 46r resulted in the consolidation of five joint ventures with aggregate assets of 185 million effective january 1 2004 that were previously accounted for under the equity method the consolidation of these joint ventures did not have a significant effect on our consolidated financial statements or results of operations 

we lease 76 properties to a total of 9 tenants that have been identified as vies we acquired these leases variable interests on october 5 2006 in our acquisition of crp crp determined they were not the primary beneficiary of the vies and we are generally required to carry forward crp’s accounting conclusions after the acqusition relative to their primary beneficiary assessment we may need to reassess whether we are the primary beneficiary in the future upon the occurrence of a reconsideration event as defined by fin 46r if we determine that we are the primary beneficiary in the future and consolidate the tenant our financial statements would reflect the tenant’s facility level revenues and expenses rather than lease revenue our maximum exposure to losses resulting from our involvement in these vies is limited to the future minimum lease payments to be received from these leases which totaled 16 billion as of december 31 2006 if we are required to consolidate any vie in the future we will depend on the vie to provide us timely financial information and we will rely on the internal controls of the vie if the vie does not provide us with timely financial information or has deficiencies in its financial reporting internal controls this may adversely impact our financial reporting and our internal controls over financial reporting 

we adopted emerging issues task force issue “eitf” 045 investor’s accounting for an investment in a limited partnership when the investor is the sole general partner and the limited partners have certain rights “eitf 045” effective june 2005 the issue concludes as to what rights held by the limited partners preclude consolidation in circumstances in which the sole general partner would otherwise consolidate the limited partnership in accordance with gaap the assessment of limited partners’ rights and their impact on the presumption of control of the limited partnership by the sole general partner should be made when an investor becomes the sole general partner and should be reassessed if i there is a change to the terms or in the exercisability of the rights of the limited partners ii the sole general partner increases or decreases its ownership of limited partnership interests or iii there is an increase or decrease in the number of outstanding limited partnership interests this eitf also applies to managing members in limited liability companies the adoption of eitf 045 did not have an impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 

investments in entities which we do not consolidate but for which we have the ability to exercise significant influence over operating and financial policies are reported under the equity method generally under the equity method of accounting our share of the investee’s earnings or loss is included in our operating results 

revenue recognition 

rental income from tenants is recognized in accordance with gaap including securities and exchange commission “sec” staff accounting bulletin no 104 revenue recognition “sab 104” for leases with minimum scheduled rent increases we recognize income on a straightline basis over the lease term when collectibility is reasonably assured recognizing rental income on a straightline basis for leases results in recognized revenue exceeding amounts contractually due from tenants such cumulative excess amounts are included in other assets and were 356 million and 184 million net of allowances at december 31 2006 and 2005 respectively in the event we determine that collectibility of straightline rents is not reasonably assured we limit future recognition to amounts contractually owed and where appropriate we establish an allowance for estimated losses certain leases provide for additional rents based upon a percentage of the facility’s revenue in excess of specified base periods or other thresholds such revenue is deferred until the related thresholds are achieved 

we monitor the liquidity and creditworthiness of our tenants and borrowers on an ongoing basis this evaluation considers industry and economic conditions property performance security deposits and guarantees and other matters we establish provisions and maintain an allowance for estimated losses resulting from the possible inability of our tenants and borrowers to make payments sufficient to recover recognized assets for straightline rent amounts our assessment is based on income recoverable over the term of the lease at december 31 2006 and 2005 we had an allowance of 297 million and 216 million respectively included in other assets as a result of our determination that collectibility is not reasonably assured for certain straightline rent amounts 

real estate 

real estate consisting of land buildings and improvements is recorded at cost we allocate the cost of the acquisition to the acquired tangible and identified intangible assets and liabilities primarily lease related intangibles based on their estimated fair values in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards “sfas” no 141 business combinations  

we assess fair value based on estimated cash flow projections that utilize appropriate discount andor capitalization rates thirdparty appraisals and available market information estimates of future cash flows are based on a number of factors including historical operating results known and anticipated trends and market and economic conditions the fair value of the tangible assets of an acquired property considers the value of the property as if it were vacant 

we record acquired “above and below” market leases at their fair value using a discount rate which reflects the risks associated with the leases acquired equal to the difference between i the contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to each inplace lease and ii management’s estimate of fair market lease rates for each corresponding inplace lease measured over a period equal to the remaining term of the lease for abovemarket leases and the initial term plus the term of any belowmarket fixedrate renewal options for belowmarket leases other intangible assets acquired include amounts for inplace lease values that are based on our evaluation of the specific characteristics of each tenant’s lease factors to be considered include estimates of carrying costs during hypothetical expected leaseup periods market conditions and costs to execute similar leases in estimating carrying costs we include estimates of lost rentals at market rates during the expected leaseup periods depending on local market conditions in estimating costs to execute similar leases we consider leasing commissions legal and other related costs 

impairment of longlived assets 

we assess the carrying value of our longlived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may not be recoverable and with respect to goodwill at least annually applying a fairvaluebased test if the sum of the expected future net undiscounted cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the longlived asset an impairment loss will be recognized by adjusting the asset’s carrying amount to its estimated fair value the determination of the fair value of longlived assets including goodwill involves significant judgment this judgment is based on our analysis and estimates of the future operating results and resulting cash flows of each longlived asset our ability to accurately predict future operating results and cash flows impacts the determination of fair value 

net investment in direct financing leases 

we use the direct finance method of accounting to record income from direct financing leases for leases accounted for as direct financing leases future minimum lease payments are recorded as a receivable the difference between the rents receivable and the estimated residual values less the cost of the properties is recorded as unearned income unearned income is deferred and amortized to income over the lease terms to provide a constant rate of return investments in direct financing leases are presented net of unamortized unearned income direct financing leases have initial terms that range from 

5 to 35 years and provide for minimum annual rent certain leases contain provisions that allow the tenants to elect to purchase the properties during or at the end of the lease terms for the aggregate initial investment amount plus adjustments if any as defined in the lease agreements certain leases also permit the company to require the tenants to purchase the properties at the end of the lease terms 

results of operations 

comparison of the year ended december 31 2006 to the year ended december 31 2005 

on october 5 2006 we completed our merger with crp on november 30 2006 we acquired the interest held by an affiliate of ge in hcp mop which resulted in the consolidation of hcp mop beginning on that date the impact on various income statement line items from our merger with crp and consolidation of hcp mop are discussed below 

rental and related revenue   mob rental revenue increased 495 or 628 million to 1897 million for the year ended december 31 2006 approximately 234 million of the increase relates to mobs acquired in the crp merger and 59 million relates to the consolidation of hcp mop the remaining increase in mob rental income primarily relates to the additive effect or our mob acquisitions in 2006 and 2005

contractual obligations 

the following table summarizes our material contractual payment obligations and commitments at december 31 2006 in thousands 

 

  

inflation 

our leases often provide for either fixed increases in base rents or indexed escalators based on the consumer price index or other measures andor additional rent based on increases in the tenants’ operating revenues substantially all of our mob leases require the tenant to pay a share of property operating costs such as real estate taxes insurance utilities etc we believe that inflationary increases in expenses will be offset in part by the tenant expense reimbursements and contractual rent increases described above

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

at december 31 2006 we are exposed to market risks related to fluctuations in interest rates on 215 million of variable rate mortgage notes payable 06 billion of variable rate line of credit 05 billion term loan and 325 million of variable rate senior unsecured notes of the 215 million of variable rate mortgage notes payable outstanding 456 million has been hedged through interest rate swap contracts we do not have and do not plan to enter into derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes of our consolidated debt of 62 billion at december 31 2006 excluding the 456 million of variable rate debt where the rates have been hedged to a fixed rate approximately 26 is at variable interest rates which includes a 05 billion term loan that was used to pay the cash consideration of our merger with crp we repaid the remaining balance of the term loan with proceeds from our january 2007 joint venture and capital market transactions which further reduced our variable interest rate exposure 

fluctuation in the interest rates will not affect our future earnings and cash flows on our fixed rate debt until that debt must be replaced or refinanced however interest rate changes will affect the fair value of our fixed rate instruments and our hedge contracts conversely changes in interest rates on variable rate debt would change our future earnings and cash flows but not affect the fair value of those instruments assuming a one percentage point increase in the interest rate related to the variablerate debt and related swap contracts and assuming no change in the outstanding balance as of december 31 2006 interest expense for 2006 would increase by approximately 17 million or 011 per common share on a diluted basis 

the principal amount and the average interest rates for our mortgage loans receivable and debt categorized by maturity dates is presented in the table below the fair value estimates for the mortgage loans receivable are based on the estimates of management and on rates currently prevailing for comparable loans the fair market value for our debt securities and senior notes payable are based on prevailing market prices the fair market value estimates for secured loans and mortgage notes payable are based on discounting future cash flows utilizing current rates offered to us for loans and debt of the same type and remaining maturity

as indicated in the accompanying management’s annual report on internal control over financial reporting management’s assessment of and conclusion on the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting did not include the internal controls of cnl retirement properties inc and cnl retirementcorp which are included in the 2006 consolidated financial statements of health care property investors inc and constituted 56 billion and 37 billion of total and net assets respectively as of december 31 2006 and 981 million of revenues for the year then ended our audit of internal control over financial reporting of health care property investors inc also did not include an evaluation of the internal control over financial reporting of cnl retirement properties inc and cnl retirementcorp 

in our opinion management’s assessment that health care property investors inc maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2006 is fairly stated in all material respects based on the coso criteria also in our opinion health care property investors inc maintained in all material respects effective internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2006 based on the coso criteria 

we have also audited in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board united states the consolidated balance sheets of health care property investors inc as of december 31 2006 and 2005 and the related consolidated statements of income stockholders’ equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended december 31 2006 and our report dated february 12 2007 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon

healthcare industry 

healthcare is the single largest industry in the united states representing 153 of us gross domestic product “gdp” in 2003 and growing at a rate faster than the overall economy 

healthcare expenditures rising as a percentage of gdp 

source centers for medicare and medicaid december 2005 compound annual growth rate “cagr” 

the delivery of healthcare services requires real estate and as a consequence healthcare providers depend on real estate to maintain and grow their businesses hcp believes that the current healthcare real estate market provides an investment opportunity for investors based on 

·   likelihood of consolidation of the fragmented healthcare real estate sector

·   specialized nature of healthcare real estate investing and

·   compelling demographics driving the demand for healthcare services

senior citizens are the largest consumers of healthcare services according to the centers for medicare and medicaid on a per capita basis the 75 years and older segment of the population spends 75 more on healthcare than the 65 to 74yearold segment and nearly 400 more than the population average

business strategy 

we are organized to invest in healthcare related facilities our primary goal is to increase shareholder value through profitable growth our investment strategy to achieve this goal is based on three principles—opportunistic investing portfolio diversification and conservative financing 

opportunistic investing 

we make real estate investments that are expected to drive profitable growth and create longterm shareholder value we attempt to position ourselves to create and take advantage of situations where we believe the opportunities meet our goals and investment criteria we invest in properties directly and through joint ventures and provide secured financing depending on the nature of the investment opportunity 

portfolio diversification 

we believe in maintaining a portfolio of healthcarerelated real estate diversified by sector geography operator and investment product diversification within the healthcare industry reduces the likelihood that a single event would materially harm our business this allows us to take advantage of opportunities in different markets based on individual market dynamics while pursuing our strategy of 

maintaining diversification in our portfolio there are no specific limitations on the percentage of our total assets that may be invested in any one property property type geographic location or in the number of properties which we may invest lease or lend to a single operator with investments in multiple sectors of healthcare real estate hcp can focus on opportunities with the best riskreward profile for the portfolio as a whole rather than having to choose from transactions within a specific property type 

conservative financing 

we believe a conservative balance sheet provides us with the ability to execute our opportunistic investing approach and portfolio diversification principles we maintain our conservative balance sheet by actively managing our debt to equity levels and maintaining available sources of liquidity such as our revolving line of credit our debt is primarily fixed rate which reduces the impact of rising interest rates on our operations generally we attempt to match the longterm duration of our leases with longterm fixed rate financing 

in underwriting our investments we structure and adjust the price of the investment in accordance with our assessment of risk we may structure transactions as master leases require indemnifications obtain enhancements in the form of letters of credit or security deposits and take other measures to mitigate risk we finance our investments based on our evaluation of available sources of funding for shortterm purposes we may utilize our revolving line of credit or arrange for other shortterm borrowings from banks or other sources we arrange for longerterm financing through public offerings or from institutional investors we may incur additional indebtedness or issue preferred or common stock 

we may incur additional mortgage indebtedness on real estate we acquire we may also obtain nonrecourse or other mortgage financing on unleveraged properties in which we have invested or may refinance existing debt on properties acquired 

competition 

our properties compete with the facilities of other landlords and healthcare providers the landlords and operators of these competing properties may have capital resources substantially in excess of ours or of the operators of our facilities the occupancy and rental income at our properties depend upon several factors including the number of physicians using the healthcare facilities or referring patients to the facilities competing properties and healthcare providers and the size and composition of the population in the surrounding area private federal and state payment programs and the effect of laws and regulations may also have a significant influence on the profitability of the properties and their tenants virtually all of our properties operate in a competitive environment in which tenants patients and referral sources including physicians may change their preferences for a healthcare facility from time to time 

investing in real estate is highly competitive we face competition from other reits investment companies healthcare operators and other institutional investors when we attempt to acquire properties increased competition reduces the number of opportunities that meet our investment criteria if we do not identify investments that meet our investment criteria our ability to increase shareholder value through profitable growth may be limited

healthcare sectors and property types 

we have investments in senior housing facilities medical office buildings hospitals skilled nursing facilities and other healthcare facilities certain tenants of our properties are reliant on government reimbursements such as those from medicare and medicaid—see governmental regulation for the 

potential impact on the value of our investments and our results of operations the following describes the nature of the operations of our tenants and borrowers 

senior housing facilities   we have interests in 140 senior housing facilities including four properties in unconsolidated joint ventures senior housing properties include ilfs alfs and ccrcs which cater to different segments of the elderly population based upon their needs services provided by our tenants in these facilities are primarily paid for by the residents directly or through private insurance and are less reliant on government reimbursement such as medicaid and medicare

·   independent living facilities ilfs are designed to meet the needs of seniors who choose to live in an environment surrounded by their peers with services such as housekeeping meals and activities these residents generally do not need assistance with activities of daily living “adls” including bathing eating and dressing however residents have the option to contract for these services

·   assisted living facilities alfs are licensed care facilities that provide personal care services support and housing for those who need help with adls yet require limited medical care the programs and services may include transportation social activities exercise and fitness programs beauty or barber shop access hobby and craft activities community excursions meals in a dining room setting and other activities sought by residents these facilities are often in apartmentlike buildings with private residences ranging from single rooms to large apartments certain alfs may offer higher levels of personal assistance for residents with alzheimer’s disease or other forms of dementia based in part on local regulations

·   continuing care retirement communities   ccrcs provide housing and healthrelated services under longterm contracts this alternative is appealing to residents as it eliminates the need for relocating when health and medical needs change thus allowing residents to “age in place” some ccrcs require a substantial entry fee or buyin fee and most also charge monthly maintenance fees in exchange for a living unit meals and some health services ccrcs typically require the individual to be in relatively good health and independent upon entry

medical office buildings   we have interests in 170 mobs including 63 properties owned by hcp medical office portfolio llc “hcp mop” these facilities typically contain physicians’ offices and examination rooms and may also include pharmacies hospital ancillary service space and outpatient services such as diagnostic centers rehabilitation clinics and daysurgery operating rooms while these facilities are similar to commercial office buildings they require more plumbing electrical and mechanical systems to accommodate multiple exam rooms that require sinks in every room brighter lights and special equipment such as medical gases

hospitals   we have interests in 29 hospitals which include 17 acute care three longterm acute care and nine rehabilitation hospitals services provided by our tenants in these facilities are paid for by private sources third party payors eg insurance and hmos or through the medicare and medicaid programs

·   acute care hospitals acute care hospitals offer a wide range of services such as fullyequipped operating and recovery rooms obstetrics radiology intensive care open heart surgery and coronary care neurosurgery neonatal intensive care magnetic resonance imaging nursing units oncology clinical laboratories respiratory therapy physical therapy nuclear medicine rehabilitation services and outpatient services

·   longterm acute care hospitals longterm acute care hospitals provide care for patients with complex medical conditions that require longer stays and more intensive care monitoring or emergency backup than that available in most skilled nursingbased subacute programs

·   rehabilitation hospitals rehabilitation hospitals provide inpatient and outpatient care for patients who have sustained traumatic injuries or illnesses such as spinal cord injuries strokes head injuries orthopedic problems workrelated disabilities and neurological diseases

skilled nursing facilities   we have interests in 165 snfs snfs offer restorative rehabilitative and custodial nursing care for people not requiring the more extensive and sophisticated treatment available at hospitals ancillary revenues and revenue from subacute care services are derived from providing services to residents beyond room and board and include occupational physical speech respiratory and intravenous therapy wound care oncology treatment brain injury care and orthopedic therapy as well as sales of pharmaceutical products and other services certain skilled nursing facilities provide some of the foregoing services on an outpatient basis skilled nursing services provided by our tenants in these facilities are primarily paid for either by private sources or through the medicare and medicaid programs

other healthcare facilities   we have investments in ten healthcare laboratory and biotech research facilities these facilities are designed to accommodate research and development in the biopharmaceutical industry drug discovery and development and predictive and personalized medicine we also have investments in five physician group practice clinic facilities leased to five different tenants six health and wellness centers and two facilities used for other healthcare purposes the physician group practice clinics generally provide a broad range of medical services through organized physician groups representing various medical specialties health and wellness centers provide testing and preventative health maintenance services

investment products 

owned and joint venture property investments 

as of december 31 2005 we had investments in 527 properties including 67 properties through joint ventures whether owned wholly or through joint ventures the owned properties may be characterized as one of three types triplenet leased property operating property or development property 

triplenet leased properties 

triplenet leased properties are generally singletenant buildings leased to a healthcare provider under a triplenet lease pursuant to triplenet leases tenants pay base rent and additional rent to us and pay all operating expenses incurred at the property including utilities property taxes insurance and repairs and maintenance certain leases contain annual base rent escalations based on a predetermined fixed rate an inflation index or some other factor other leases may require tenants to pay additional rent based upon a percentage of the facility’s revenue in excess of the revenue for a specific base period or threshold 

the first year annual base rental rates on properties we acquired during 2005 ranged from 7 to 9 of the purchase price of the property rental rates vary by lease taking into consideration many factors including 

·   creditworthiness of the tenant

·   operating performance of the facility

·   cost of capital at the inception of the lease

·   location type and physical condition of the facility

·   barriers to entry such as certificates of need competitive development and constraining high land costs and

·   lease term

our hospitals skilled nursing facilities and senior housing facilities are typically leased on a triplenet basis with initial terms that range from five to 15 years and generally have one or more renewal options as of december 31 2005 the weighted average remaining term excluding unexercised renewal options on these triplenet leased properties is approximately eight years 

operating properties 

our operating properties are typically multitenant medical office buildings that are leased to multiple healthcare providers hospitals and physician practices under a gross modified gross or net lease structure under a gross or modified gross lease all or a portion of operating expenses are not reimbursed by tenants most of our owned mobs are managed by third party property management companies and 19 are leased on a net basis while 88 are leased to multiple tenants under gross or modified gross leases pursuant to which we are responsible for certain operating expenses regardless of lease structure most of our leases at operating properties include annual base rent escalation clauses that are either predetermined fixed increases or are a function of an inflation index and typically have an initial term ranging from one to fourteen years with a weighted average remaining term of approximately five years as of december 31 2005 

the following table reflects the reduction in revenue based on 2005 revenue for owned triplenet leased and operating properties resulting from lease expirations absent the impact of renewals if any in thousands 

 

  

development properties 

we generally commit to development projects when they are at least 50 preleased we use internal and external construction management expertise to evaluate local market conditions construction costs and other factors to seek appropriate risk adjusted returns during 2005 we completed and placed into service approximately 5 million of owned development properties in addition during 2005 hcp mop completed and placed into service approximately 8 million of development properties as of december 31 2005 we have an interest in four properties under development 

secured loan investments 

we have investments in 13 mortgage loans secured by 25 properties that are owned and operated by 11 healthcare providers our secured loan investments typically consist of senior mortgages or mezzanine financing on individual properties or a pool of properties at december 31 2005 the carrying amount of these mortgage loans totaled 1754 million initial interest rates on mortgage loans outstanding at december 31 2005 range from 75 to 135 per annum at december 31 2005 minimum future principal payments to be received on secured loans receivable are 665 million in 2006 88 million in 2007 24 million in 2008 72 million in 2009 398 million in 2010 and 507 million thereafter our mortgage loans generally include prepayment penalties or yield maintenance provisions 

operator concentration 

the following table provides information about the concentration of business with our top five operators for the year ended december 31 2005 dollars in thousands 

 

1   represents the carrying amount of real estate assets including intangibles after adding back accumulated depreciation and amortization

all of our properties associated with the aforementioned operators are under triplenet leases these operators are subject to the informational filing requirements of the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended and are required to file periodic reports with the securities and exchange commission financial and other information relating to these operators may be obtained from their public reports 

according to public disclosures by tenet and healthsouth each is experiencing various legal financial and regulatory difficulties we cannot predict with certainty the impact if any of the outcome of these uncertainties on their financial condition the failure or inability of these operators to pay their obligations could materially reduce our revenues net income and cash flows which could in turn reduce the amount of cash available for the payment of dividends cause our stock price to decline and cause us to incur impairment charges or a loss on the sale of the properties 

one of our hospitals located in tarzana california is operated by tenet and is affected by state of california senate bill 1953 which requires certain seismic safety building standards for acute care hospital facilities see “government regulation—california senate bill 1953” for more information

taxation of hcp 

we believe that we have operated in such a manner as to qualify for taxation as a reit under sections 856 to 860 of the internal revenue code of 1986 as amended the “code” commencing with our taxable year ended december 31 1985 and we intend to continue to operate in such a manner no assurance can be given that we have operated or will be able to continue to operate in a manner so as to qualify or to remain so qualified this summary is qualified in its entirety by the applicable code provisions rules and regulations promulgated thereunder and administrative and judicial interpretations thereof 

if we qualify for taxation as a reit we will generally not be required to pay federal corporate income taxes on the portion of our net income that is currently distributed to stockholders this treatment substantially eliminates the “double taxation” ie at the corporate and stockholder levels that generally results from investment in a corporation however we will be required to pay federal income tax under certain circumstances 

the code defines a reit as a corporation trust or association i which is managed by one or more trustees or directors ii the beneficial ownership of which is evidenced by transferable shares or by transferable certificates of beneficial interest iii which would be taxable but for sections 856 through 860 of the code as a domestic corporation iv which is neither a financial institution nor an insurance company subject to certain provisions of the code v the beneficial ownership of which is held by 100 or more persons vi during the last half of each taxable year not more than 50 in value of the outstanding stock of which is owned actually or constructively by five or fewer individuals and vii which meets certain other tests described below regarding the amount of its distributions and the nature of its income and assets the code provides that conditions i to iv inclusive must be met during the entire taxable year and that condition v must be met during at least 335 days of a taxable year of 12 months or during a proportionate part of a taxable year of less than 12 months 

there are presently two gross income requirements first at least 75 of our gross income excluding gross income from “prohibited transactions” as defined below for each taxable year must be derived directly or indirectly from investments relating to real property or mortgages on real property or from certain types of temporary investment income second at least 95 of our gross income excluding gross income from prohibited transactions for each taxable year must be derived from income that qualifies under the 75 test and all other dividends interest and gain from the sale or other disposition of stock or securities a “prohibited transaction” is a sale or other disposition of property other than foreclosure property held for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business 

at the close of each quarter of our taxable year we must also satisfy four tests relating to the nature of our assets first at least 75 of the value of our total assets must be represented by real estate assets certain stock or debt instruments purchased with the proceeds of a stock offering or long term public debt offering by us but only for the oneyear period after such offering cash cash items and government securities second not more than 25 of our total assets may be represented by securities other than those in the 75 asset class third of the investments included in the 25 asset class the value of any one issuer’s securities owned by us may not exceed 5 of the value of our total assets and we may not own more than 10 of the vote or value of the securities of a nonreit corporation other than certain debt securities and interests in taxable reit subsidiaries or qualified reit subsidiaries each as defined below fourth not more than 20 of the value of our total assets may be represented by securities of one or more taxable reit subsidiaries 

we own interests in various partnerships and limited liability companies in the case of a reit that is a partner in a partnership or a member of a limited liability company that is treated as a partnership under the code treasury regulations provide that for purposes of the reit income and asset tests the reit will be deemed to own its proportionate share of the assets of the partnership or limited liability company determined in accordance with its capital interest in the entity subject to special rules related to the 10 asset test and will be deemed to be entitled to the income of the partnership or limited liability company attributable to such share the ownership of an interest in a partnership or limited liability company by a reit may involve special tax risks including the challenge by the internal revenue service the “service” of the allocations of income and expense items of the partnership or limited liability company which would affect the computation of taxable income of the reit and the status of the partnership or limited liability company as a partnership as opposed to an association taxable as a corporation for federal income tax purposes 

we also own interests in a number of subsidiaries which are intended to be treated as qualified reit subsidiaries each a “qrs” the code provides that such subsidiaries will be ignored for federal income tax purposes and all assets liabilities and items of income deduction and credit of such subsidiaries will be treated as our assets liabilities and such items if any partnership limited liability company or subsidiary in which we own an interest were treated as a regular corporation and not as a partnership qrs or taxable reit subsidiary as the case may be for federal income tax purposes we would likely fail to satisfy the reit asset tests described above and would therefore fail to qualify as a reit unless certain relief provisions apply we believe that each of the partnerships limited liability companies and subsidiaries other than taxable reit subsidiaries in which we own an interest will be treated for tax purposes as a partnership or disregarded entity in the case of a 100 owned partnership or limited liability company or qrs as applicable although no assurance can be given that the service will not successfully challenge the status of any such organization 

as of december 31 2005 we owned interests in two subsidiaries which are intended to be treated as taxable reit subsidiaries each a “trs” a reit may own any percentage of the voting stock and value of the securities of a corporation which jointly elects with the reit to be a trs provided certain requirements are met a trs generally may engage in any business including the provision of customary or noncustomary services to tenants of its parent reit and of others except a trs may not manage or 

operate a hotel or healthcare facility a trs is treated as a regular corporation and is subject to federal income tax and applicable state income and franchise taxes at regular corporate rates in addition a 100 tax may be imposed on a reit if its rental service or other agreements with its trs or the trs’s agreements with the reit’s tenants are not on arm’slength terms 

in order to qualify as a reit we are required to distribute dividends other than capital gain dividends to our stockholders in an amount at least equal to a the sum of i 90 of our “real estate investment trust taxable income” computed without regard to the dividends paid deduction and our net capital gain and ii 90 of the net income if any after tax from foreclosure property minus b the sum of certain items of noncash income such distributions must be paid in the taxable year to which they relate or in the following taxable year if declared before we timely file our tax return for such year if paid on or before the first regular dividend payment date after such declaration and if we so elect and specify the dollar amount in our tax return to the extent that we do not distribute all of our net longterm capital gain or distribute at least 90 but less than 100 of our “real estate investment trust taxable income” as adjusted we will be required to pay tax thereon at regular corporate tax rates furthermore if we should fail to distribute during each calendar year at least the sum of i 85 of our ordinary income for such year ii 95 of our capital gain income for such year and iii any undistributed taxable income from prior periods we would be required to pay a 4 excise tax on the excess of such required distributions over the amounts actually distributed 

if we fail to qualify for taxation as a reit in any taxable year and certain relief provisions do not apply we will be required to pay tax including any applicable alternative minimum tax on our taxable income at regular corporate rates distributions to stockholders in any year in which we fail to qualify will not be deductible by us nor will they be required to be made unless entitled to relief under specific statutory provisions we will also be disqualified from taxation as a reit for the four taxable years following the year during which qualification was lost it is not possible to state whether in all circumstances we would be entitled to the statutory relief failure to qualify for even one year could substantially reduce distributions to stockholders and could result in our incurring substantial indebtedness to the extent borrowings are feasible or liquidating substantial investments in order to pay the resulting taxes 

we and our stockholders may be required to pay state or local tax in various state or local jurisdictions including those in which we or they transact business or reside the state and local tax treatment of us and our stockholders may not conform to the federal income tax consequences discussed above 

we may also be subject to certain taxes applicable to reits including taxes in lieu of disqualification as a reit on undistributed income on income from prohibited transactions on net income from foreclosure property and on builtin gains from the sale of certain assets acquired from c corporations in taxfree transactions 

government regulation 

the healthcare industry is heavily regulated by federal state and local laws this government regulation of the healthcare industry affects us because 

1   governmental regulations such as licensure certification for participation in government programs and government reimbursement may impact the financial ability of some of our operators to make rent and debt payments to us which in turn may affect the value of our investments and

2   the amount of reimbursement such operators receive from the government and other third parties may affect the amounts we receive in additional rents which are often based on our operators’ gross revenue from operations

these laws and regulations are subject to frequent and substantial changes resulting from legislation adoption of rules and regulations and administrative and judicial interpretations of existing law these changes may have a dramatic effect on the definition of permissible or impermissible activities the relative costs associated with doing business and the amount of reimbursement by government and other thirdparty payors these changes may be applied retroactively the ultimate timing or effect of these changes cannot be predicted the failure of any tenant or borrower to comply with such laws regulations and requirements could affect its ability to operate its facility or facilities and could adversely affect such operator’s ability to make lease or debt payments to us 

fraud and abuse laws   there are various federal and state laws prohibiting fraud and abusive business practices by healthcare providers who participate in receive payments from or are in a position to make referrals in connection with a governmentsponsored healthcare program including but not limited to the medicare and medicaid programs these include

·   the federal antikickback statute which prohibits among other things the offer payment solicitation or receipt of any form of remuneration in return for or to induce the referral of medicare and medicaid patients

·   the federal physician selfreferral prohibition stark which restricts physicians from making referrals for certain designated health services for which payment may be made under medicare or medicaid programs to an entity with which the physician or an immediate family member has a financial relationship

·   the false claims act which prohibits any person from knowingly presenting false or fraudulent claims for payment to the federal government including the medicare and medicaid programs

·   the civil monetary penalties law which is imposed by the department of health and human services for fraudulent acts

each of these laws include criminal andor civil penalties for violations that range from punitive sanctions damage assessments penalties imprisonment denial of medicare and medicaid payments andor exclusion from the medicare and medicaid programs imposition of any of these types of penalties on our tenants or borrowers could result in a material adverse effect on their operations which could adversely affect our business additionally certain laws such as the false claims act allow for individuals to bring qui tam whistleblower actions on behalf of the government for violations of fraud and abuse laws some medicare fiscal intermediaries private companies that contract with centers for medicare  medicaid services “cms” to administer the medicare program have also increased scrutiny of cost reports filed by skilled nursing providers 

environmental matters   a wide variety of federal state and local environmental and occupational health and safety laws and regulations affect healthcare facility operations under various federal state and local environmental laws ordinances and regulations an owner of real property or a secured lender such as us may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of hazardous or toxic substances at under or disposed of in connection with such property as well as other potential costs relating to hazardous or toxic substances including government fines and damages for injuries to persons and adjacent property the cost of any required remediation removal fines or personal or property damages and the owner’s or secured lender’s liability therefore could exceed the value of the property andor the assets of the owner or secured lender in addition the presence of such substances or the failure to properly dispose of or remediate such substances may adversely affect the owner’s ability to sell or rent such property or to borrow using such property as collateral which in turn would reduce our revenue although the mortgage loans that we provide and the leases covering our properties require the borrower and the tenant to indemnify us for certain environmental liabilities the scope of such obligations may be 

limited and we cannot assure that any such borrower or tenant would be able to fulfill its indemnification obligations 

the medicare and medicaid programs   sources of revenue for operators may include the federal medicare program state medicaid programs private insurance carriers healthcare service plans and health maintenance organizations among others efforts to reduce costs by these payors will likely continue which may result in reduced or slower growth in reimbursement for certain services provided by some of our operators in addition the failure of any of our operators to comply with various laws and regulations could jeopardize their certification and ability to continue to participate in the medicare and medicaid programs medicaid programs differ from state to state but they are all subject to federallyimposed requirements at least 50 of the funds available under these programs are provided by the federal government under a matching program medicaid programs generally pay for acute and rehabilitative care based on reasonable costs at fixed rates skilled nursing facilities are generally reimbursed using fixed daily rates medicaid payments are generally below retail rates for tenantoperated facilities increasingly states have introduced managed care contracting techniques into the administration of medicaid programs such mechanisms could have the impact of reducing utilization of and reimbursement to facilities other third party payors in various states base payments on costs retail rates or increasingly negotiated rates negotiated rates can include discounts from normal charges fixed daily rates and prepaid capitated rates

healthcare facilities   the healthcare facilities in our portfolio including hospitals skilled nursing facilities assisted living facilities and physician group practice clinics are subject to extensive federal state and local licensure certification and inspection laws and regulations failure to comply with any of these laws could result in loss of accreditation denial of reimbursement imposition of fines suspension or decertification from federal and state healthcare programs loss of license or closure of the facility such actions may have an effect on the revenue of the operators of properties owned by or mortgaged to us and therefore adversely impact us

entrance fee communities   certain of the senior housing facilities mortgaged to or owned by us are operated as entrance fee communities generally an entrance fee is an upfront fee or consideration paid by a resident a portion of which may be refundable in exchange for some form of longterm benefit some of the entrance fee communities are subject to significant state regulatory oversight including for example oversight of each facility’s financial condition establishment and monitoring of reserve requirements and other financial restrictions the right of residents to cancel their contracts within a specified period of time lien rights in favor of the residents restrictions on change of ownership and similar matters such oversight and the rights of residents within these entrance fee communities may have an effect on the revenue or operations of the operators of such facilities and therefore may adversely impact us

california senate bill 1953   our hospital located in tarzana california is affected by state of california senate bill 1953 sb 1953 which requires certain seismic safety building standards for acute care hospital facilities this hospital is operated by tenet under a lease expiring in february 2009 we and tenet are currently reviewing the sb 1953 compliance of this hospital multiple plans of action to cause such compliance the estimated time for completing the same and the cost of performing necessary remediation of the property we cannot currently estimate the remediation costs that will need to be incurred prior to 2013 in order to make the facility sb 1953compliant through 2030 or the final allocation of any remediation costs between us and tenet rent on the hospital in 2005 and 2004 was 108 million and 106 million respectively and our carrying amount is 761 million at december 31 2005

nurse staffing ratios   on january 1 2004 a california law became effective mandating specific minimum nurse staffing ratios for acute care hospitals as a result of this requirement hospital labor costs will be materially increased facilities may also be forced to limit patient admissions due to an inability to 

hire the necessary number of nurses to meet the required ratio which affects net operating revenue it is unclear the extent to which compliance with these nurse staffing ratios in california may adversely affect hospital operators in california 

current developments 

the healthcare industry continues to face various challenges including increased government and private payor pressure on healthcare providers to control costs the migration of patients from acute care facilities into extended care and home care settings and the vertical and horizontal consolidation of healthcare providers 

changes in the law new interpretations of existing laws and changes in payment methodologies may have a dramatic effect on the definition of permissible or impermissible activities the relative costs associated with doing business and the amount of reimbursement furnished by government and other thirdparty payors these changes may be applied retroactively under certain circumstances the ultimate timing or effect of legislative efforts cannot be predicted and may impact us in different ways 

in december of 2003 the medicare prescription drug improvement and modernization act of 2003 the “act” was signed into law the act established an 18month moratorium on the “whole hospital exception” to the stark law whereby physicians have been permitted to refer patients for designated health services to hospitals in which they have an ownership interest the moratorium removed specialty hospitals from the “whole hospital exception” from december 8 2003 through june 7 2005 specialty hospitals include hospitals primarily or exclusively engaged in the care and treatment of cardiac conditions or orthopedic conditions or hospitals that perform certain surgical procedures specialty hospitals in operation or under development as of november 18 2003 were grandfathered under the moratorium the act requires that medpac an independent federal body established to advise congress on issues affecting the medicare program and hhs conduct studies on the costs of service utilization quality of care and financial impact of specialty hospitals and their physician owners relative to community hospitals particularly nonprofits on january 14 2005 medpac announced that it would recommend that congress extend the stark specialty hospital moratorium for an additional 18 months to january 1 2007 to address concerns about the effects of physician investments in specialty hospitals medpac’s recommendations were based upon its findings that when compared with community hospitals physician owned specialty hospitals tend to concentrate on certain more profitable diagnostic related groups “drgs” and on patients with relatively low severity within those drgs and tend to treat lower percentages of medicare patients congress is not obligated to follow medpac’s recommendations legislation has been introduced in congress the hospital fair competition act of 2005 that would extend the moratorium for specialty hospitals it is uncertain if such legislation will be enacted this year or in subsequent sessions of congress notwithstanding the uncertainty of legislation extending the moratorium cms instructed medicare fiscal intermediaries to stop processing new medicare provider enrollment applications for specialty hospitals after june 8 2005 pending cms’s review of how specialty hospitals satisfy core requirements applicable to “hospitals” under medicare and how the emergency medical treatment and active labor act should apply to specialty hospitals cms expects to complete its review in early 2006 with further changes in 2006 to the hospital inpatient prospective payment system to reduce the ability of specialty hospitals to take advantage of imprecise payment rates under the current system 

in addition to the reforms enacted and considered by congress from time to time state legislatures periodically consider various healthcare reform proposals congress and state legislatures can be expected to continue to review and assess alternative healthcare delivery systems new regulatory enforcement initiatives and new payment methodologies 

we believe that government and private efforts to contain or reduce healthcare costs will continue these trends are likely to lead to reduced or slower growth in reimbursement for certain services provided 

by some of our operators in addition recent trends of hospitals providing more services to uninsured patients or on an outpatient basis rather than inpatient basis may continue and could adversely affect the profitability of our operators we believe that the vast nature of the healthcare industry the financial strength and operating flexibility of our operators and the diversity of our portfolio will mitigate the impact of any such trends however we cannot predict what legislation will be adopted and no assurance can be given that the healthcare reforms will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 

employees 

at december 31 2005 we had 83 fulltime employees and no parttime employees none of whom are subject to a collective bargaining agreement we consider our relations with our employees to be good 

legal entities 

we conduct our business through various legal entities including the following at december 31 2005 

 

  

 

  




 item 1a   risk factors

you should carefully consider the risks described below as well as the risks described in “competition” “government regulation” and “taxation of hcp” and elsewhere in this report which risks are incorporated by reference into this section before making an investment decision regarding our company the risks and uncertainties described herein are not the only ones facing us and there may be additional risks that we do not presently know of or that we currently consider not likely to have a significant impact all of these risks could adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

risks related to our operators 

if our facility operators are unable to operate our properties in a manner sufficient to generate income they may be unable to make rent and loan payments to us 

the healthcare industry is highly competitive and we expect that it may become more competitive in the future our operators are subject to competition from other healthcare providers that provide similar services such competition which has intensified due to overbuilding in some segments in which we operate has caused the fillup rate of newly constructed buildings to slow and the monthly rate that many newly built and previously existing facilities were able to obtain for their services to decrease the profitability of healthcare facilities depends upon several factors including the number of physicians using 

the healthcare facilities or referring patients there competitive systems of healthcare delivery and the size and composition of the population in the surrounding area private federal and state payment programs and the effect of other laws and regulations may also have a significant influence on the revenues and income of the properties if our operators are not competitive with other healthcare providers and are unable to generate income they may be unable to make rent and loan payments to us which could adversely affect our cash flow and financial performance and condition 

the bankruptcy insolvency or financial deterioration of our facility operators could significantly delay our ability to collect unpaid rents or require us to find new operators 

our financial position and our ability to make distributions to our stockholders may be adversely affected by financial difficulties experienced by any of our major operators including bankruptcy insolvency or a general downturn in the business or in the event any of our major operators do not renew or extend their relationship with us as their lease terms expire 

we are exposed to the risk that our operators may not be able to meet their obligations which may result in their bankruptcy or insolvency although our leases and loans provide us the right to terminate an investment evict an operator demand immediate repayment and other remedies the bankruptcy laws afford certain rights to a party that has filed for bankruptcy or reorganization an operator in bankruptcy may be able to restrict our ability to collect unpaid rents or interest during the bankruptcy proceeding 

tenet healthcare corporation accounts for a significant percentage of our revenues and is currently experiencing significant legal financial and regulatory difficulties 

during 2005 tenet healthcare corporation accounted for approximately 11 of our revenues according to public disclosures tenet is experiencing significant legal financial and regulatory difficulties we cannot predict with certainty the impact if any of the outcome of these uncertainties on our consolidated financial statements the failure or inability of tenet to pay its obligations could materially reduce our revenue net income and cash flows which could adversely affect the value of our common stock and could cause us to incur impairment charges or a loss on the sale of the properties 

our operators are faced with increased litigation and rising insurance costs that may affect their ability to make their lease or mortgage payments 

in some states advocacy groups have been created to monitor the quality of care at healthcare facilities and these groups have brought litigation against operators also in several instances private litigation by patients has succeeded in winning very large damage awards for alleged abuses the effect of this litigation and potential litigation has been to materially increase the costs of monitoring and reporting quality of care compliance incurred by our operators in addition the cost of liability and medical malpractice insurance has increased and may continue to increase so long as the present litigation environment affecting the operations of healthcare facilities continues continued cost increases could cause our operators to be unable to make their lease or mortgage payments potentially decreasing our revenue and increasing our collection and litigation costs moreover to the extent we are required to take back the affected facilities our revenue from those facilities could be reduced or eliminated for an extended period of time 

decline in the skilled nursing sector and changes to medicare and medicaid reimbursement rates may have significant adverse consequences to us 

certain of our skilled nursing operators and facilities continue to experience operating problems in part due to a national nursing shortage increased liability insurance costs and low levels of medicare and medicaid reimbursement due to economic challenges facing many states nursing homes will likely continue to be underfunded these challenges have had and may continue to have an adverse effect on our longterm care facilities and facility operators 

risks related to real estate investment and our structure 

we rely on external sources of capital to fund future capital needs and if our access to such capital is difficult or on commercially unreasonable terms we may not be able to meet maturing commitments or make future investments necessary to grow our business 

in order to qualify as a reit under the internal revenue code we are required among other things to distribute to our stockholders each year at least 90 of our reit taxable income because of this distribution requirement we may not be able to fund all future capital needs including capital needs in connection with acquisitions from cash retained from operations as a result we rely on external sources of capital if we are unable to obtain needed capital at all or only on unfavorable terms from these sources we might not be able to make the investments needed to grow our business or to meet our obligations and commitments as they mature which could negatively affect the ratings of our debt and even in extreme circumstances affect our ability to continue operations our access to capital depends upon a number of factors over which we have little or no control including 

·   general market conditions

·   the market’s perception of our growth potential

·   our current and potential future earnings and cash distributions and

·   the market price of the shares of our capital stock

if we are unable to identify and purchase suitable healthcare facilities at a favorable cost we will be unable to continue to grow through acquisitions 

our ability to grow through acquisitions is integral to our business strategy and requires us to identify suitable acquisition candidates that meet our criteria and are compatible with our growth strategy the acquisition and financing of healthcare facilities at favorable costs is highly competitive we may not be successful in identifying suitable property or other assets that meet our acquisition criteria or in consummating acquisitions on satisfactory terms or at all if we cannot identify and purchase a sufficient quantity of healthcare facilities at favorable prices or if we are unable to finance such acquisitions on commercially favorable terms our business will suffer 

unforeseen costs associated with the acquisition of new properties could reduce our profitability 

our business strategy contemplates future acquisitions the acquisitions we make may not prove to be successful we might encounter unanticipated difficulties and expenditures relating to any acquired properties including contingent liabilities further newly acquired properties might require significant management attention that would otherwise be devoted to our ongoing business we might never realize the anticipated benefits of an acquisition which could adversely affect our profitability 

since real estate investments are illiquid we may not be able to sell properties when we desire 

real estate investments generally cannot be sold quickly we may not be able to vary our portfolio promptly in response to changes in the real estate market this inability to respond to changes in the performance of our investments could adversely affect our ability to service our debt the real estate market is affected by many factors that are beyond our control including 

·   adverse changes in national and local economic and market conditions

·   changes in interest rates and in the availability costs and terms of financing

·   changes in governmental laws and regulations fiscal policies and zoning and other ordinances and costs of compliance with laws and regulations

·   the ongoing need for capital improvements particularly in older structures

·   changes in operating expenses and

·   civil unrest acts of war and natural disasters including earthquakes and floods which may result in uninsured and underinsured losses

we cannot predict whether we will be able to sell any property for the price or on the terms set by us or whether any price or other terms offered by a prospective purchaser would be acceptable to us we also cannot predict the length of time needed to find a willing purchaser and to close the sale of a property in addition there are provisions under the federal income tax laws applicable to reits that may limit our ability to recognize the full economic benefit from a sale of our assets these factors and any others that would impede our ability to respond to adverse changes in the performance of our properties could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition 

transfers of healthcare facilities generally require regulatory approvals and alternative uses of healthcare facilities are limited 

because transfers of healthcare facilities may be subject to regulatory approvals not required for transfers of other types of commercial operations and other types of real estate there may be delays in transferring operations of our facilities to successor operators or we may be prohibited from transferring operations to a successor operator in addition substantially all of our properties are healthcare facilities that may not be easily adapted to nonhealthcare related uses if we are unable to transfer properties at times opportune to us our revenue and operations may suffer 

we may experience uninsured or underinsured losses 

we generally require our operators to secure and maintain comprehensive liability and property insurance that covers us as well as the operators on most of our properties some types of losses however either may be uninsurable or too expensive to insure against should an uninsured loss or a loss in excess of insured limits occur we could lose all or a portion of the capital we have invested in a property as well as the anticipated future revenue from the property in such an event we might nevertheless remain obligated for any mortgage debt or other financial obligations related to the property we cannot assure you that material losses in excess of insurance proceeds will not occur in the future 

increases in interest rates may increase our interest expense and adversely affect our cash flow and our ability to service our indebtedness 

at december 31 2005 our total consolidated indebtedness was approximately 20 billion of which approximately 295 million or 15 is subject to variable interest rates this variable rate debt had a weighted average interest rate of approximately 50 per annum increases in interest rates on this variable rate debt would increase our interest expense which could harm our cash flow and our ability to service our indebtedness 

loss of our tax status as a reit would have significant adverse consequences to us 

we currently operate and have operated commencing with our taxable year ended december 31 1985 in a manner that is intended to allow us to qualify as a reit for federal income tax purposes under the internal revenue code of 1986 as amended 

qualification as a reit involves the application of highly technical and complex internal revenue code provisions for which there are only limited judicial and administrative interpretations the determination of various factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control may affect our ability to qualify as a reit for example in order to qualify as a reit at least 95 of our gross income 

in any year must be derived from qualifying sources and we must satisfy a number of requirements regarding the composition of our assets also we must make distributions to stockholders aggregating annually at least 90 of our reit taxable income excluding capital gains in addition new legislation regulations administrative interpretations or court decisions may adversely affect our investors or our ability to qualify as a reit for tax purposes although we believe that we have been organized and have operated in such manner we can give no assurance that we have qualified or will continue to qualify as a reit for tax purposes 

if we lose our reit status we will face serious tax consequences that will substantially reduce the funds available to make payments of principal and interest on the debt securities we issue and to make distributions to our stockholders if we fail to qualify as a reit 

·   we would not be allowed a deduction for distributions to stockholders in computing our taxable income and would be subject to federal income tax at regular corporate rates

·   we also could be subject to the federal alternative minimum tax and possibly increased state and local taxes and

·   unless we are entitled to relief under statutory provisions we could not elect to be subject to tax as a reit for four taxable years following the year during which we were disqualified

in addition if we fail to qualify as a reit all distributions to stockholders would be subject to tax as regular corporate dividends to the extent of our current and accumulated earnings and profits and we would not be required to make distributions to stockholders 

as a result of all these factors our failure to qualify as a reit also could impair our ability to expand our business and raise capital and could adversely affect the value of our common stock 




 item 1b   unresolved staff comments

none 




 item 2   properties

we are organized to invest in incomeproducing healthcare related facilities in evaluating potential investments we consider such factors as 

·   the location construction quality condition and design of the property

·   the geographic area proximity to other healthcare facilities type of property and demographic profile

·   whether the rent provides a competitive market return to our investors

·   the duration rental rates tenant quality and other attributes of inplace leases

·   the current and anticipated cash flow and its adequacy to meet our operational needs

·   the potential for capital appreciation

·   the expertise and reputation of the operator

·   occupancy and demand for similar health facilities in the same or nearby communities

·   an adequate mix between private and government sponsored patients at health facilities

·   the availability of qualified operators or property managers or whether we can manage the property

·   potential alternative uses of the facilities

·   the regulatory and reimbursement environment in which the properties operate

·   the tax laws related to real estate investment trusts

·   prospects for liquidity through financing or refinancing and

·   our cost of capital

executive summary 

we are a real estate investment trust “reit” that invests in healthcare related properties located throughout the united states we develop acquire and manage healthcare real estate and provide mortgage financing to healthcare providers we invest directly often structuring saleleaseback 

transactions and through joint ventures at december 31 2005 our real estate portfolio including assets held through joint ventures and mortgage loans consisted of interests in 527 facilities located in 42 states 

our business strategy is based on three principles i opportunistic investing ii portfolio diversification and iii conservative financing we actively redeploy capital from investments with lower return potential into assets with higher return potential and recycle capital from shorter term to longer term investments we make investments where the expected riskadjusted return exceeds our cost of capital and strive to leverage our operator and other business relationships 

our strategy contemplates acquiring and developing properties on favorable terms we attempt to structure transactions that are taxadvantaged and mitigate risks in our underwriting process generally we prefer larger more complex private transactions that leverage our management team’s experience and our infrastructure during 2005 we made gross investments of 647 million these investments had an average first year yield on cost of just over 767 our 2005 investments of were allocated among the following healthcare sectors i 62 senior housing facilities ii 32 mobs and iii 6 hospitals 

we follow a disciplined approach to enhancing the value of our existing portfolio including the ongoing evaluation of properties for potential disposition that no longer fit our strategy we sold interests in 20 properties during 2005 for 71 million and had seven properties with a carrying amount of 5 million classified as held for sale at year end 

we primarily generate revenue by leasing healthcare related properties under longterm operating leases most of our rents are received under triplenet leases however medical office building “mob” rents are typically structured as gross or modified gross leases accordingly for mobs we incur certain property operating expenses such as real estate taxes repairs and maintenance property management fees utilities and insurance our growth depends in part on our ability to i increase rental income by increasing occupancy levels and rental rates ii maximize tenant recoveries given underlying lease structures and iii control operating and other expenses our operations are impacted by property specific market specific general economic and other conditions 

access to external capital on favorable terms is critical to the success of our strategy we attempt to match the longterm duration of our leases with longterm fixed rate financing at december 31 2005 15 of our consolidated debt is at variable interest rates we intend to maintain an investment grade rating on our fixed income securities and manage various capital ratios and amounts within appropriate parameters as of december 31 2005 our senior debt is rated bbb by both standard  poor’s and fitch ratings and baa2 by moody’s investors service 

capital market access impacts our cost of capital and our ability to refinance existing indebtedness as it matures as well as to fund future acquisitions and development through the issuance of additional securities our ability to access capital on favorable terms is dependent on various factors including general market conditions interest rates credit ratings on our securities perception of our potential future earnings and cash distributions and the market price of our capital stock

critical accounting policies 

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” requires management to use judgment in the application of accounting policies including making estimates and assumptions our judgments are based on our experience interpretation of the facts and circumstances and on various other estimates and assumptions believed to be reasonable under the circumstances these judgments affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods if our judgment or interpretation of the facts and circumstances relating to various transactions or other matters had been different it is possible that different accounting would have been applied resulting in a different presentation of our financial statements from time to time we reevaluate our estimates and assumptions in the event estimates or assumptions prove to be different from actual results adjustments are made in subsequent periods to reflect more current estimates and assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain 

use of estimates 

management is required to make estimates and assumptions in the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods actual results could differ 

principles of consolidation 

our consolidated financial statements include the accounts of hcp its wholly owned subsidiaries and its controlled through voting rights or other means joint ventures all material intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation 

we have adopted interpretation no 46r consolidation of variable interest entities  as revised “fin 46r” effective january 1 2004 for variable interest entities created before february 1 2003 and effective in fiscal year 2003 for variable interest entities created after january 31 2003 fin 46r provides guidance on the identification of entities for which control is achieved through means other than voting rights “variable interest entities” or “vies” and the determination of which business enterprise is the primary beneficiary of the vie a variable interest entity is broadly defined as an entity where either i the equity investors as a group if any do not have a controlling financial interest or ii the equity investment at risk is insufficient to finance that entity’s activities without additional financial support we consolidate investments in vies when it is determined that we are the primary beneficiary of the vie at either the creation of the variable interest entity or upon the occurrence of a reconsideration event the adoption of 

fin 46r resulted in the consolidation of five joint ventures with aggregate assets of 185 million effective january 1 2004 that were previously accounted for under the equity method the consolidation of these joint ventures did not have a significant effect on our consolidated financial statements or results of operations 

we adopted emerging issues task force issue “eitf” 045 investor’s accounting for an investment in a limited partnership when the investor is the sole general partner and the limited partners have certain rights “eitf 045” effective june 2005 the issue concludes as to what rights held by the limited partners preclude consolidation in circumstances in which the sole general partner would otherwise consolidate the limited partnership in accordance with gaap the assessment of limited partners’ rights and their impact on the presumption of control of the limited partnership by the sole general partner should be made when an investor becomes the sole general partner and should be reassessed if i there is a change to the terms or in the exercisability of the rights of the limited partners ii the sole general partner increases or decreases its ownership of limited partnership interests or iii there is an increase or decrease in the number of outstanding limited partnership interests this eitf also applies to managing members in limited liability companies the adoption of eitf 045 did not have an impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 

investments in entities which we do not consolidate but for which we have the ability to exercise significant influence over operating and financial policies are reported under the equity method generally under the equity method of accounting our share of the investee’s earnings or loss is included in our operating results 

revenue recognition 

rental income from tenants is recognized in accordance with gaap including securities and exchange commission “sec” staff accounting bulletin no 104 revenue recognition “sab 104” for leases with minimum scheduled rent increases we recognize income on a straightline basis over the lease term when collectibility is reasonably assured recognizing rental income on a straightline basis for leases results in recognized revenue exceeding amounts contractually due from tenants such cumulative excess amounts are included in other assets and were 184 million and 110 million net of allowances at december 31 2005 and 2004 respectively in the event we determine that collectibility of straightline rents is not reasonably assured we limit future recognition to amounts contractually owed and where appropriate we establish an allowance for estimated losses certain leases provide for additional rents based upon a percentage of the facility’s revenue in excess of specified base periods or other thresholds such revenue is deferred until the related thresholds are achieved 

we monitor the liquidity and creditworthiness of our tenants and borrowers on an ongoing basis this evaluation considers industry and economic conditions property performance security deposits and guarantees and other matters we establish provisions and maintain an allowance for estimated losses resulting from the possible inability of its tenants and borrowers to make payments sufficient to recover recognized assets for straightline rent amounts our assessment is based on income recoverable over the term of the lease at december 31 2005 and 2004 we had an allowance of 216 million and 158 million respectively included in other assets as a result of our determination that collectibility is not reasonably assured for certain straightline rent amounts 

real estate 

real estate consisting of land buildings and improvements is recorded at cost we allocate the cost of the acquisition to the acquired tangible and identified intangible assets and liabilities primarily lease related intangibles based on their estimated fair values in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards “sfas” no 141 business combinations  

we assess fair value based on estimated cash flow projections that utilize appropriate discount andor capitalization rates third party appraisals and available market information estimates of future cash flows are based on a number of factors including historical operating results known and anticipated trends and market and economic conditions the fair value of the tangible assets of an acquired property considers the value of the property as if it were vacant 

we record acquired “above and below” market leases at their fair value using a discount rate which reflects the risks associated with the leases acquired equal to the difference between i the contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to each inplace lease and ii management’s estimate of fair market lease rates for each corresponding inplace lease measured over a period equal to the remaining term of the lease for abovemarket leases and the initial term plus the term of any belowmarket fixedrate renewal options for belowmarket leases other intangible assets acquired include amounts for inplace lease values that are based on our evaluation of the specific characteristics of each tenant’s lease factors to be considered include estimates of carrying costs during hypothetical expected leaseup periods market conditions and costs to execute similar leases in estimating carrying costs we include real estate taxes insurance and other operating expenses and estimates of lost rentals at market rates during the expected leaseup periods depending on local market conditions in estimating costs to execute similar leases we consider leasing commissions legal and other related costs 

real estate assets are periodically reviewed for potential impairment by comparing the carrying amount to the expected undiscounted future cash flows to be generated from the assets if the sum of the expected future net undiscounted cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the property we will recognize an impairment loss by adjusting the asset’s carrying amount to its estimated fair value fair value for properties to be held and used is based on the present value of the future cash flows expected to be generated from the asset properties held for sale are recorded at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less costs to dispose our ability to accurately predict future cash flows impacts the determination of fair value which may significantly impact our reported results of operations 

results of operations 

comparison of the year ended december 31 2005 to the year ended december 31 2004 

rental and other revenue   mob rental revenue increased 35 to 1269 million for the year ended december 31 2005 the increase in mob rental revenue of 332 million primarily relates to the additive effect of our acquisitions in 2005 and 2004 which contributed 267 million to rental revenues year over year

triplenet lease rental revenues increased 13 to 3253 million for the year ended december 31 2005 the increase in triplenet lease rental revenue of 377 million primarily relates to the additive effect of our acquisitions in 2005 and 2004 as detailed below 

 

  

we also recognized 57 million of rental income during the fourth quarter of 2004 resulting from a change in estimate related to the collectibility of straightline rental income from arc additionally included in triplenet lease rental revenues are facility level operating revenues for five senior housing properties that were previously leased on a net basis periodically tenants default on their leases which cause us to take temporary possession of the operations of the facility we contract with third party managers to manage these properties until a replacement tenant can be identified or the property can be sold the operating revenues and expenses for these properties are included in triplenet lease rental revenues and operating expenses respectively the increase in reported revenues for these facilities of 36 million to 77 million for the year ended december 31 2005 was primarily due to us taking possession of two of these properties in 2005 and increases in overall occupancy of such properties 

equity income loss   equity income decreased to a loss of 11 million primarily due to our investment in hcp mop for which we recorded equity losses of 14 million and equity income of 15 million for 2005 and 2004 respectively during the years ended december 31 2005 and 2004 hcp mop revised its purchase price allocation and attributed more of the purchase price of the properties acquired from medcap properties llc to belowmarket lease intangibles and other intangibles from real estate assets lease intangibles generally amortize over a shorter period of time relative to tangible real estate assets the decrease in the equity income from our investment in hcp mop was primarily due to the revisions to the purchase price allocations referred to above additionally hcp mop incurred repairs and other related expenses for damages caused by hurricanes katrina and rita of 14 million during the year ended december 31 2005 see note 7 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on hcp mop

interest and other income   interest and other income decreased 27 to 262 million for the year ended december 31 2005 the change reflects a reduced level of loans receivable following an 83 million repayment from arc and a 17 million repayment from emeritus during the third quarter of 2004 the decrease in interest and other income was partially offset by gains from the sale of various investments of 45 million in 2005 the gains from these investments were primarily the result of the sale of securities in 2005 which were acquired in conjunction with real estate and or leasing transactions we completed in previous years during the year ended december 31 2005 and 2004 we also recognized management and other fees from hcp mop of 31 million in each period

interest expense   interest expense increased 22 to 1072 million for the year ended december 31 2005 the increase was due to the issuance of 450 million of senior notes payable in april and september of 2005 and the assumption of 1135 million of mortgage notes payable in connection with the acquisitions of real estate properties which resulted in increased borrowing levels and an overall increase in shortterm variable rates the table below sets forth information with respect to our debt as of december 31 2005 and 2004

 

  

depreciation and amortization   real estate depreciation and amortization increased 26 to 1069 million for the year ended december 31 2005 the increase in depreciation and amortization of 218 million primarily relates to the additive effect of our acquisitions in 2005 and 2004 as detailed below

 

  

operating expenses   operating costs increased 39 to 590 million for the year ended december 31 2005 operating costs are predominantly related to mob properties that are leased under gross or modified gross lease agreements where we share certain costs with tenants additionally we contract with third party property managers for most of our mob properties accordingly the number of properties in our mob portfolio directly impacts operating costs the increase in operating expenses of 165 million primarily relates to the effect of our acquisitions in 2005 and 2004 as detailed below

 

  

additionally included in operating expenses are facility level operating expenses for five senior housing properties that were previously leased on a net basis periodically tenants default on their leases which cause us to take temporary possession of the operations of the facility we contract with third party managers to manage these properties until a replacement tenant can be identified or the property can be sold the revenues and expenses for these properties are included in triplenet lease rental revenues and operating expenses respectively the increase in reported operating expenses for these facilities of 36 million to 87 million for the year ended december 31 2005 was primarily due to us taking possession of two of these properties in 2005 and an increase in the overall occupancy of such properties 

the presentation of expenses between general and administrative and operating expenses is based on the underlying nature of the expense periodically we review the classification of expenses between categories and make revisions based on changes in the underlying nature of the expense 

general and administrative expenses   general and administrative expenses decreased 13 to 321 million for the year ended december 31 2005 the decrease was due to higher costs in 2004 primarily resulting from 15 million of income tax expense on income from certain assets held in a taxable reit subsidiary the implementation of a new information system considerable resources that were expended towards initial compliance with certain regulatory requirements principally section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 07 million in expenses associated with the relocation of our corporate offices to long beach california in 2004 and a charge of 16 million related to the settlement of a lawsuit filed against us by our former executive vice president and chief financial officer offsetting the decrease from 2004 was an increase in compensation related expenses due to an increase in fulltime employees from 74 at december 31 2004 to 83 at december 31 2005

discontinued operations   income from discontinued operations for the year ended december 31 2005 was 139 million compared to 149 million for the comparable period in the prior year the change is due to a decline in the carrying value of assets disposed from 151 million in 2004 to 54 million in 2005 and resulted in a decrease in the year over year gains on sale of real estate of 109 million and a related decline of operating income of 58 million associated with discontinued operations the changes in net gain on sale and operating income were predominantly offset by a year over year reduction of impairment charges of 158 million

comparison of the year ended december 31 2004 to the year ended december 31 2003 

rental and other revenue   mob rental revenue increased 22 to 937 million for the year ended december 31 2004 the increase in mob rental revenue of 172 million primarily relates to the additive effect of our acquisitions in 2004 and 2003 which contributed 147 million to rental revenues year over year

triplenet lease rental revenues increased 19 to 2876 million for the year ended december 31 2004 the increase in triplenet lease rental revenue of 461 million primarily relates to the additive effect of our acquisitions in 2004 and 2003 as detailed below 

 

  

we also recognized 57 million of rental income during the fourth quarter of 2004 resulting from a change in estimate related to the collectibility of straightline rental income from arc the consolidation 

of five joint ventures upon the adoption of fin 46r effective january 2004 increased reported triplenet lease rental income by approximately 28 million 

equity income loss   equity income decreased 25 to 22 million primarily due to our acquisition of four retirement living facilities in september 2003 which were accounted for under the equity method this was offset by higher hcp mop interest expense following hcp mop obtaining 288 million of nonrecourse mortgage debt in early 2004 during 2004 and 2003 we recognized 15 million and 17 million of equity income from hcp mop respectively at december 31 2004 100 properties were held by unconsolidated joint ventures including hcp mop compared to 115 properties at december 31 2003

interest and other income   interest and other income decreased 25 to 361 million for the year ended december 31 2004 the change reflects the net effects of i 46 million of revenue from the recognition of arc interest income upon the repayment by arc during 2004 of 83 million of debt and accrued interest thereon and ii a reduced level of loans receivable following the aforementioned repayment from arc and a 17 million repayment from emeritus during 2004 and 2003 we also recognized management and other fees from hcp mop of 31 million and 25 million respectively other income in 2003 includes a 34 million tax related accrual reversal related to our 1999 acquisition of american health properties

interest expense   interest expense decreased 1 to 876 million for the year ended december 31 2004 the change was due to a decrease in overall interest rates offset by minor increases in borrowing levels the table below sets forth information with respect to our debt as of december 31 2004 and 2003

 

  

depreciation and amortization   real estate depreciation and amortization increased 19 to 851 million for the year ended december 31 2004 the increase in depreciation and amortization of 135 million primarily relates to our acquisitions in 2004 and 2003 as detailed below

 

  

operating expenses   operating costs increased 24 to 425 million for the year ended december 31 2004 operating costs are predominantly related to mob properties that are leased under gross or modified gross lease agreements where we share certain costs with tenants additionally we contract with third party property managers for most of our mob properties accordingly the number of properties in our mob portfolio directly impacts operating costs the increase in operating expenses of 82 million primarily relates to the effect of our acquisitions in 2004 and 2003 as detailed below

 

  

the presentation of expenses between general and administrative and operating expenses is based on the underlying nature of the expense periodically we review the classification of expenses between categories and make revisions based on changes in the underlying nature of the expense 

general and administrative expenses   general and administrative expenses increased 63 to 367 million for the year ended december 31 2004 the increase was due to higher costs in 2004 primarily resulting from income tax expense of 15 million on income from certain assets held in a taxable reit subsidiary and the implementation of a new information system and considerable resources that were expended towards initial compliance with certain regulatory requirements principally section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 also contributing to the increase was 07 million in expenses associated with the move of our corporate offices to long beach california and a charge of 16 million related to the settlement of a lawsuit filed against us by our former executive vice president and chief financial officer

discontinued operations   income from discontinued operations for the year ended december 31 2004 was 149 million compared to 183 million for the comparable period in the prior year the change is primarily due to an increase in impairment charges of 39 million year over year the year over year increase in gains on sale of 89 million was predominantly offset by comparable period decrease in operating income of 85 million

liquidity and capital resources 

our principal liquidity needs are to i fund normal operating expenses ii meet debt service requirements iii fund capital expenditures including tenant improvements and leasing costs iv fund acquisition and development activities and v make minimum distributions required to maintain our reit qualification under the internal revenue code as amended 

we believe these needs will be satisfied using cash flows generated by operations and provided by financing activities we intend to repay maturing debt with proceeds from future debt andor equity offerings and anticipate making future investments dependent on the availability of costeffective sources of capital we use the public debt and equity markets as our principal source of financing as of december 31 2005 our senior debt is rated bbb by both standard  poor’s ratings group and fitch ratings and baa2 by moody’s investors service 

net cash provided by operating activities was 2821 million and 2725 million for 2005 and 2004 respectively cash flow from operations reflects increased revenues offset by higher costs and expenses and changes in receivables payables accruals and deferred revenue our cash flows from operations are dependent upon the occupancy level of multitenant buildings rental rates on leases our tenants’ performance on their lease obligations the level of operating expenses and other factors 

net cash used in investing activities was 4148 million during 2005 and principally reflects the net effect of i 646 million received from the sale of several facilities ii 4472 million principally used to fund acquisitions and construction of real estate iii 533 million used to fund investments in loans receivable and iv 191 million in principal repayments received on loans during 2005 and 2004 we used 71 million and 34 million to fund lease commissions and tenant and capital improvements respectively 

net cash provided by financing activities was 1371 million for 2005 and includes proceeds of 452 million from common stock issuances and 4455 million from senior note issuances these proceeds were partially offset by i the repayment of 310 million of senior notes ii net repayment of 415 million of our line of credit iii payment of common and preferred dividends aggregating 2484 million and iv repayments on mortgage debt of 179 million in order to qualify as a reit for federal income tax purposes we must distribute at least 90 of our taxable income to our shareholders accordingly we intend to continue to make regular quarterly distributions to holders of our common and preferred stock 

at december 31 2005 we held approximately 119 million in deposits and 442 million in irrevocable letters of credit from commercial banks securing tenants’ lease obligations and borrowers’ loan obligations we may draw upon the letters of credit or depository accounts if there are defaults under the related leases or loans amounts available under letters of credit could change based upon facility operating conditions and other factors and such changes may be material 

bank line of credit mortgage debt and senior unsecured notes 

at december 31 2005 we had the following outstanding debt 

bank line of credit   borrowings under our 500 million threeyear bank line of credit were 2586 million with an interest rate of 501 at december 31 2005 borrowings under the bank line of credit accrue interest at 65 basis points over the london inter bank offering rate “libor” with a 15 basis point facility fee in addition a negotiated rate option whereby the lenders participating in the credit facility bid on the interest to be charged and which may result in a reduced interest rate is available for up to 50 of borrowings the credit facility also contains an “accordion” feature allowing borrowings to be increased by 100 million in certain conditions

the credit agreement contains certain financial restrictions and requirements customary in transactions of this type the more significant covenants using terms defined in the agreement limit the ratios of i consolidated total indebtedness to consolidated total asset value to 60 ii secured debt to consolidated total asset value to 30 and iii unsecured debt to consolidated unencumbered asset value to 60 we must also maintain i a fixed charge coverage ratio as defined of 175 times and ii a formuladetermined minimum tangible net worth as of december 31 2005 we were in compliance with each of these restrictions and requirements 

mortgage debt   at december 31 2005 we had 2361 million in mortgage debt secured by 38 healthcare facilities with a carrying amount of 3845 million interest rates on the mortgage notes ranged from 275 to 932 with a weighted average rate of 705 at december 31 2005

senior unsecured notes at december 31 2004 included 200 million principal amount of mandatory par put remarketed securities “mopprs” due june 8 2015 the mopprs contained an option the “mopprs option” exercisable by the remarketing dealer an investment bank affiliate which derived its value from the yield on tenyear us treasury rates relative to a fixed strike rate of 5565 generally the value of the option to the remarketing dealer increased as tenyear treasury rates declined and the option’s value to the remarketing dealer decreased as tenyear treasury rates increased 

on june 3 2005 the remarketing dealer exercised its option to redeem our 200 million principal amount of 6875 mopprs the remarketing dealer redeemed the securities from the holders at par plus accrued interest and reissued tenyear senior notes with a coupon of 7072 the reissued notes are at an effective interest rate which is higher than what would otherwise have been available if we had issued new tenyear notes at par value

during the year ended december 31 2005 we issued approximately 878000 shares of our common stock under our dividend reinvestment and stock purchase plan at an average price per share of 2580 for proceeds of 226 million we also received 229 million in proceeds from stock option exercises at december 31 2005 stockholders’ equity totaled 14 billion and our equity securities had a market value of 39 billion

as of december 31 2005 we had 106 billion available for future issuances of debt and equity securities under a shelf registration statement filed with the securities and exchange commission these securities may be issued from time to time in the future based on our needs and the thenexisting market conditions 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

we own interests in certain unconsolidated joint ventures including hcp mop as described under note 7 to the consolidated financial statements except in limited circumstances our risk of loss is limited to our investment carrying amount and any outstanding loans receivable 

we have no other material off balance sheet arrangements that we expect to materially affect our liquidity and capital resources except these described under “contractual obligations” 

contractual obligations 

the following table summarizes our material contractual payment obligations and commitments at december 31 2005 in thousands 

 

  

inflation 

our leases often provide for either fixed increases in base rents or indexed escalators based on the consumer price index or other measures andor additional rent based on increases in the tenant’s revenue from the facility substantially all of our mob leases require the tenant to pay a share of property operating costs such as real estate taxes insurance utilities etc we believe that inflationary increases in expenses will be offset in part by the tenant expense reimbursements and contractual rent increases described above 

new accounting pronouncements 

see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for the impact of new accounting standards 




 item 7a   quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk

at december 31 2005 we are exposed to market risks related to fluctuations in interest rates on 573 million of variable rate mortgage notes payable 2586 million of variable rate bank debt and 250 million of variable rate senior unsecured notes of the 573 million of variable rate mortgage notes payable 

outstanding 456 million has been hedged through interest rate swap contracts we do not have any and do not plan to enter into derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes of our consolidated debt of 20 billion at december 31 2005 excluding the 456 million of variable rate debt where the rates have been hedged to fixed rates approximately 15 is at variable interest rates 

fluctuation in the interest rate environment will not affect our future earnings and cash flows on our fixed rate debt until that debt must be replaced or refinanced however interest rate changes will affect the fair value of our fixed rate instruments and our hedge contracts conversely changes in interest rates on variable rate debt would change our future earnings and cash flows but not affect the fair value of those instruments assuming a one percentage point increase in the interest rate related to the variablerate debt and related swap contracts and assuming no change in the outstanding balance as of december 31 2005 interest expense for 2005 would increase by approximately 3 million or 002 per common share on a diluted basis 

the principal amount and the average interest rates for our mortgage loans receivable and debt categorized by maturity dates is presented in the table below the fair value estimates for the mortgage loans receivable are based on the estimates of management and on rates currently prevailing for comparable loans the fair market value estimates for debt securities are based on discounting future cash flows utilizing current rates offered to us for debt of the same type and remaining maturity

business strategy 

  

we are organized to invest in incomeproducing health care related facilities our primary goal is to increase shareholder value through profitable growth our investment strategy to achieve this goal is based on three principles — opportunistic investing portfolio diversification and conservative financing 

  

opportunistic investing 

  

we make real estate investments that are expected to drive profitable growth and create longterm shareholder value we attempt to position ourselves to create and take advantage of situations where we believe the opportunities meet our goals and investment criteria we invest in properties directly and through joint ventures and provide secured financing depending on the nature of the investment opportunity 

  

portfolio diversification 

  

we believe in maintaining a portfolio of heath care related real estate diversified by sector geography operator and investment product diversification within the health care industry reduces the likelihood that a single event would materially harm our business this allows us to take advantage of opportunities in different markets based on individual market dynamics while pursuing our strategy of attaining diversification in our portfolio there are no specific limitations on the percentage of our total assets that may be invested in any one property property type geographic location or in the number of properties in which we seek to invest or lease to a single operator 

  

conservative financing 

  

we believe a conservative balance sheet provides us with the ability to execute our opportunistic investing approach and portfolio diversification principles we maintain our conservative balance sheet by actively managing our debt to equity levels and maintaining available sources of liquidity such as our line of credit our debt is primarily fixed rate which reduces the impact of rising interest rates on our operations generally we attempt to match the longterm duration of our leases with longterm fixed rate financing 

  

in underwriting our investments we structure and adjust the price of the investment in accordance with our assessment of risks we may structure transactions as master leases require indemnifications obtain enhancements in the form of letters of credit or security deposits and take other measures to mitigate risks we finance our investments based on our evaluation of available sources of funding we may incur additional indebtedness or issue preferred or common stock for shortterm purposes we may utilize our revolving line of credit or arrange for other shortterm borrowings from banks or others we arrange for longterm borrowings through public offerings or from institutional investors 

  

we may incur additional mortgage indebtedness on real estate we acquire through purchase foreclosure or otherwise where properties are encumbered by debt we may assume existing loans we also may obtain nonrecourse or other mortgage financing on unleveraged properties in which we have invested or may refinance properties acquired on a leveraged basis 

  

competition 

  

our properties are subject to competition from the facilities of other landlords and health care providers the landlords and operators of these competing properties may have capital resources substantially in excess of some of the operators of our facilities the occupancy and rental income at our properties depend upon several factors including the number of physicians using the health care facilities or referring patients to the facilities competing properties and health care providers and the size and composition of the population in the surrounding area private federal and state payment programs and the effect of other laws and regulations may also have a significant influence on the profitability of the properties and their tenants virtually all of our properties operate in a competitive environment with tenants patients and referral sources including physicians who may change their preferences for a health care facility from time to time 

  

investing in real estate is highly competitive we face competition from other reits investment companies health care operators and other institutional investors when we attempt to acquire properties increased competition reduces the number of opportunities that meet our investment criteria if we do not identify investments that meet our investment criteria our ability to increase shareholder value through profitable growth may be limited

omnibus budget reconciliation act obra of 1981 congress established a waiver program under medicaid to offer an alternative to institutional skilled nursing services the provisions of obra and the subsequent obra acts of 1987 and 1990 allow states with federal approval greater flexibility in program design as a means of developing costeffective alternatives to delivering services traditionally provided in the skilled nursing setting this was a contributing factor to the past increase in the number of assisted living facilities which adversely affected some skilled nursing facilities as some individuals chose the residential environment and lower cost delivery system provided in the assisted living setting

the following table reflects the annual impact by year in terms of 2004 revenue for single tenant properties resulting from lease expirations in thousands 

  

   

development 

  

we provide development services and construction financing on projects that are typically preleased upon completion the assets are placed in service and included in our portfolio of directly owned properties or held by joint ventures we use our inhouse construction management expertise to evaluate local market conditions construction costs and other factors to seek appropriate risk adjusted returns during 2004 we completed and placed into service approximately 70 million of medical office buildings as of december 31 2004 we have an interest in two properties under development one of which is held by hcp mop 

  

mortgage loans 

  

we have investments in mortgage loans secured by properties that are owned and operated by 10 health care providers at december 31 2004 the carrying amount of these mortgage loans totaled 1407 million initial interest rates on mortgage loans outstanding at december 31 2004 range from 9 to 13 per annum 

  

customer concentration 

  

the following table provides information about the major operators of our properties for the year ended december 31 2004 dollars in thousands 

  

     

all of our properties associated with the aforementioned tenants are under triple net leases these companies are subject to the informational filing requirements of the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended and are required to file periodic reports with the securities and exchange commission financial and other information relating to these operators may be obtained from their public reports 

  

according to public disclosures by tenet and healthsouth each is experiencing significant legal financial and regulatory difficulties we cannot predict with certainty the impact if any of the outcome of these uncertainties on their financial statements the failure or inability of these operators to pay their obligations could materially reduce our revenues net income and cash flows which could in turn reduce the amount of cash available for the payment of dividends cause our stock price to decline and cause us to incur impairment charges or a loss on the sale of the properties 

  

one of our hospitals located in tarzana california is operated by tenet and is affected by state of california senate bill 1953 which requires certain seismic safety building standards for acute care hospital facilities see “government regulation — california senate bill 1953” for more information 

  

joint ventures 

  

consolidated joint ventures 

  

at december 31 2004 we held ownership interests in 21 limited liability companies and partnerships that together own 82 properties and one mortgage as follows

taxation of hcp 

  

we believe that we have operated in such a manner as to qualify for taxation as a reit under sections 856 to 860 of the internal revenue code of 1986 as amended the “code” commencing with our taxable year ended december 31 1985 and we intend to continue to operate in such a manner no assurance can be given that we have operated or will be able to continue to operate in a manner so as to qualify or to remain so qualified this summary is qualified in its entirety by the applicable code provisions rules and regulations promulgated thereunder and administrative and judicial interpretations thereof 

  

if we qualify for taxation as a reit we will generally not be required to pay federal corporate income taxes on the portion of our net income that is currently distributed to stockholders this treatment substantially eliminates the “double taxation” ie at the corporate and stockholder levels that generally results from investment in a corporation however we will be required to pay federal income tax under certain circumstances 

  

the code defines a reit as a corporation trust or association i which is managed by one or more trustees or directors ii the beneficial ownership of which is evidenced by transferable shares or by transferable certificates of beneficial interest iii which would be taxable but for sections 856 through 860 of the code as a domestic corporation iv which is neither a financial institution nor an insurance company subject to certain provisions of the code v the beneficial ownership of which is held by 100 or more persons vi during the last half of each taxable year not more than 50 in value of the outstanding stock of which is owned actually or constructively by five or fewer individuals and vii which meets certain other tests described below regarding the amount of its distributions and the nature of its income and assets the code provides that conditions i to iv inclusive must be met during the entire taxable year and that condition v must be met during at least 335 days of a taxable year of 12 months or during a proportionate part of a taxable year of less than 12 months 

  

there presently are two gross income requirements first at least 75 of our gross income excluding gross income from “prohibited transactions” as defined below for each taxable year must be derived directly or indirectly from investments relating to real property or mortgages on real property or from certain types of temporary investment income second at least 95 of our gross income excluding gross income from prohibited transactions for each taxable year must be derived from income that qualifies under the 75 test and all other dividends interest and gain from the sale or other disposition of stock or securities a 

  

“prohibited transaction” is a sale or other disposition of property other than foreclosure property held for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business 

  

at the close of each quarter of our taxable year we must also satisfy four tests relating to the nature of our assets first at least 75 of the value of our total assets must be represented by real estate assets certain stock or debt instruments purchased with the proceeds of a stock offering or long term public debt offering by us but only for the one year period after such offering cash cash items and government securities second not more than 25 of our total assets may be represented by securities other than those in the 75 asset class third of the investments included in the 25 asset class the value of any one issuer’s securities owned by us may not exceed 5 of the value of our total assets and we may not own more than 10 of the vote or value of the securities of a nonreit corporation other than certain debt securities and interests in taxable reit subsidiaries as defined below fourth not more than 20 of the value of our total assets may be represented by securities of one or more taxable reit subsidiaries 

  

we own interests in various partnerships and limited liability companies in the case of a reit that is a partner in a partnership or a member of a limited liability company that is treated as a partnership under the code treasury regulations provide that for purposes of the reit income and asset tests the reit will be deemed to own its proportionate share of the assets of the partnership or limited liability company and will be deemed to be entitled to the income of the partnership or limited liability company attributable to such share the ownership of an interest in a partnership or limited liability company by a reit may involve special tax risks including the challenge by the internal revenue service the “service” of the allocations of income and expense items of the partnership or limited liability company which would affect the computation of taxable income of the reit and the status of the partnership or limited liability company as a partnership as opposed to an association taxable as a corporation for federal income tax purposes 

  

we also own interests in a number of subsidiaries which are intended to be treated as qualified reit subsidiaries each a “qrs” the code provides that such subsidiaries will be ignored for federal income tax purposes and all assets liabilities and items of income deduction and credit of such subsidiaries will be treated as our assets liabilities and items if any partnership limited liability company or subsidiary in which we own an interest were treated as a regular corporation and not as a partnership qrs or taxable reit subsidiary as the case may be for federal income tax purposes we would likely fail to satisfy the reit asset tests described above and would therefore fail to qualify as a reit unless certain relief provisions apply we believe that each of the partnerships limited liability companies and subsidiaries other than taxable reit subsidiaries in which we own an interest will be treated for tax purposes as a partnership or disregarded entity in the case of a 100 owned partnership or limited liability company or qrs as applicable although no assurance can be given that the service will not successfully challenge the status of any such organization 

  

as of december 31 2004 we owned interests in two subsidiaries which are intended to be treated as taxable reit subsidiaries each a “trs” a reit may own any percentage of the voting stock and value of the securities of a corporation which jointly elects with the reit to be a trs provided certain requirements are met a trs generally may engage in any business including the provision of customary or noncustomary services to tenants of its parent reit and of others except a trs may not manage or operate a hotel or health care facility a trs is treated as a regular corporation and is subject to federal income tax and applicable state income and franchise taxes at regular corporate rates in addition a 100 tax may be imposed on a reit if its rental service or other agreements with its trs or the trs’s agreements with the reit’s tenants are not on arm’slength terms 

  

in order to qualify as a reit we are required to distribute dividends other than capital gain dividends to our stockholders in an amount at least equal to a the sum of i 90 of our “real estate investment trust taxable income” computed without regard to the dividends paid deduction and our net capital gain and ii 90 of the net income if any after tax from foreclosure property minus b the sum of certain items of 

  

noncash income such distributions must be paid in the taxable year to which they relate or in the following taxable year if declared before we timely file our tax return for such year if paid on or before the first regular dividend payment date after such declaration and if we so elect and specify the dollar amount in our tax return to the extent that we do not distribute all of our net longterm capital gain or distribute at least 90 but less than 100 of our “real estate investment trust taxable income” as adjusted we will be required to pay tax thereon at regular corporate tax rates furthermore if we should fail to distribute during each calendar year at least the sum of i 85 of our ordinary income for such year ii 95 of our capital gain income for such year and iii any undistributed taxable income from prior periods we would be required to pay a 4 excise tax on the excess of such required distributions over the amounts actually distributed 

  

if we fail to qualify for taxation as a reit in any taxable year and certain relief provisions do not apply we will be required to pay tax including any applicable alternative minimum tax on our taxable income at regular corporate rates distributions to stockholders in any year in which we fail to qualify will not be deductible by us nor will they be required to be made unless entitled to relief under specific statutory provisions we will also be disqualified from taxation as a reit for the four taxable years following the year during which qualification was lost it is not possible to state whether in all circumstances we would be entitled to the statutory relief failure to qualify for even one year could substantially reduce distributions to stockholders and could result in our incurring substantial indebtedness to the extent borrowings are feasible or liquidating substantial investments in order to pay the resulting taxes 

  

we and our stockholders may be required to pay state or local tax in various state or local jurisdictions including those in which we or they transact business or reside the state and local tax treatment of us and our stockholders may not conform to the federal income tax consequences discussed above 

  

government regulation 

  

the health care industry is heavily regulated by federal state and local laws this government regulation of the health care industry affects us because 

  

   

   

these laws and regulations are subject to frequent and substantial changes resulting from legislation adoption of rules and regulations and administrative and judicial interpretations of existing law these changes may have a dramatic effect on the definition of permissible or impermissible activities the relative costs associated with doing business and the amount of reimbursement by both government and other thirdparty payors these changes may be applied retroactively the ultimate timing or effect of these changes cannot be predicted the failure of any tenant or borrower to comply with such laws regulations and requirements could affect its ability to operate its facility or facilities and could adversely affect such tenant’s or borrower’s ability to make debt or lease payments to us 

  

fraud and abuse laws  there are various federal and state laws prohibiting fraud and abusive business practices by health care providers who participate in receive payments from or are in a position to make referrals in connection with a governmentsponsored health care program including but not limited to the medicare and medicaid programs these include 

  

   

   

   

   

each of these laws include criminal andor civil penalties for violations that range from punitive sanctions damage assessments penalties imprisonment denial of medicare and medicaid payments andor exclusion from the medicare and medicaid programs imposition of any of these types of penalties on our tenants or borrowers could result in a material adverse effect on their operations which could adversely affect our business additionally certain laws such as the false claims act allow for individuals to bring qui tam or whistleblower actions on behalf of the government for violations of fraud and abuse laws some medicare fiscal intermediaries private companies that contract with centers for medicare  medicaid services “cms” to administer the medicare program have also increased scrutiny of cost reports filed by skilled nursing providers 

  

environmental matters  a wide variety of federal state and local environmental and occupational health and safety laws and regulations affect health care facility operations under various federal state and local environmental laws ordinances and regulations an owner of real property or a secured lender such as us may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of hazardous or toxic substances at under or disposed of in connection with such property as well as other potential costs relating to hazardous or toxic substances including government fines and damages for injuries to persons and adjacent property the cost of any required remediation removal fines or personal or property damages and the owner’s or secured lender’s liability therefore could exceed the value of the property andor the assets of the owner or secured lender in addition the presence of such substances or the failure to properly dispose of or remediate such substances may adversely affect the owner’s ability to sell or rent such property or to borrow using such property as collateral which in turn would reduce our revenue although the mortgage loans that we provide and leases covering our properties require the borrower and the tenant to indemnify us for certain environmental liabilities the scope of such obligations may be limited and we cannot assure that any such borrower or tenant would be able to fulfill its indemnification obligations 

  

the medicare and medicaid programs  sources of revenue for tenants and mortgagors may include the federal medicare program state medicaid programs private insurance carriers health care service plans and health maintenance organizations among others efforts to reduce costs by these payors will likely continue which may result in reduced or slower growth in reimbursement for certain services provided by some of our operators for example president bush’s fiscal year 2006 budget includes a proposed reduction in medicare spending of approximately 15 billion including specific reductions in reimbursement to skilled nursing facilities it is uncertain to what extent president bush’s budgetary proposals will be enacted into law in addition the failure of any of our operators to comply with various laws and regulations could jeopardize their certification and ability to continue to participate in the medicare and medicaid programs 

  

state medicaid programs medicaid programs differ from state to state but they are all subject to federallyimposed requirements at least 50 of the funds available under these programs are provided by the federal government under a matching program medicaid programs generally pay for acute and rehabilitative care based on reasonable costs at fixed rates skilled nursing facilities are generally reimbursed using fixed daily rates medicaid payments are generally below retail rates for tenantoperated facilities increasingly states have introduced managed care contracting techniques in the administration of medicaid programs such mechanisms could have the impact of reducing utilization of and reimbursement to facilities 

  

other third party payors in various states and areas base payments on costs retail rates or increasingly negotiated rates negotiated rates can include discounts from normal charges fixed daily rates and prepaid capitated rates 

  

entrance fee communities  certain of the facilities mortgaged to or owned by us are operated as entrance fee communities generally an entrance fee is an upfront fee or consideration paid by a resident a portion of which may be refundable in exchange for some form of longterm benefit some of the entrance fee communities are subject to significant state regulatory oversight including for example oversight of each facility’s financial condition establishment and monitoring of reserve requirements and other financial restrictions the right of residents to cancel their contracts within a specified period of time lien rights in favor of the residents restrictions on change of ownership and similar matters such oversight and the rights of residents within these entrance fee communities may have an effect on the revenue or operations of the operators of such facilities and therefore may adversely impact us 

  

health care facilities the health care facilities in our portfolio including hospitals skilled nursing facilities assisted living facilities and physician group practice clinics are subject to extensive federal state and local licensure certification and inspection laws and regulations failure to comply with any of these laws could result in loss of accreditation denial of reimbursement imposition of fines suspension or decertification from federal and state health care programs loss of license or closure of the facility such actions may have an effect on the revenue of the operators of properties owned by or mortgaged to us and therefore adversely impact us 

  

california senate bill 1953 our hospital located in tarzana california is affected by state of california senate bill 1953 sb 1953 which requires certain seismic safety building standards for acute care hospital facilities this hospital is operated by tenet under a lease expiring in february 2009 we and tenet are currently reviewing the sb 1953 compliance of this hospital multiple plans of action to cause such compliance the estimated time for completing the same and the cost of performing necessary remediation of the property we cannot currently estimate the remediation costs that will need to be incurred prior to 2013 in order to make the facility sb 1953compliant through 2030 and the final allocation of any remediation costs between us and tenet rent on the hospital in 2004 and 2003 was 106 million and 108 million respectively and our carrying amount is 784 million at december 31 2004 

  

nurse staffing ratios  on january 1 2004 a california law became effective mandating specific minimum nurse staffing ratios for acute care hospitals as a result of this requirement hospital labor costs will be materially increased facilities may also be forced to limit patient admissions due to an inability to hire the necessary number of nurses to meet the required ratio which affects net operating revenue it is unclear the extent to which compliance with these nurse staffing ratios in california may adversely affect hospital operators in california 

  

current developments 

  

the health care industry continues to face various challenges including increased government and private payor pressure on health care providers to control costs the migration of patients from acute care facilities into extended care and home care settings and the vertical and horizontal consolidation of health care providers 

  

changes in the law new interpretations of existing laws and changes in payment methodologies may have a dramatic effect on the definition of permissible or impermissible activities the relative costs associated with doing business and the amount of reimbursement furnished by both government and other thirdparty payors these changes may be applied retroactively under certain circumstances the ultimate timing or effect of legislative efforts cannot be predicted and may impact us in different ways 

  

in december of 2003 the medicare prescription drug improvement and modernization act of 2003 the “act” was signed into law the act established an 18month moratorium on the “whole hospital 

  

exception” to the stark law whereby physicians have been permitted to refer patients for designated health services to hospitals in which they have an ownership interest the moratorium removes specialty hospitals from the “whole hospital exception” from december 8 2003 through june 7 2005 specialty hospitals include hospitals primarily or exclusively engaged in the care and treatment of cardiac conditions or orthopedic conditions or hospitals that perform certain surgical procedures specialty hospitals in operation or under development as of november 18 2003 are grandfathered under the moratorium the act requires that medpac an independent federal body established to advise congress on issues affecting the medicare program and hhs conduct studies on the costs of service utilization quality of care and financial impact of specialty hospitals and their physician owners relative to community hospitals particularly nonprofits on january 14 2005 medpac announced that it would recommend that congress extend the stark specialty hospital moratorium for an additional 18 months to address concerns about the effects of physician investments in specialty hospitals medpac’s recommendations were based upon its findings that when compared with community hospitals physician owned specialty hospitals tend to concentrate on certain more profitable diagnostic related groups “drgs” and on patients with relatively low severity within those drgs and tend to treat lower percentages of medicare patients congress is not obligated to follow medpac’s recommendations congress may take legislative action implementing medpac’s recommendations or wait for the hhs report on specialty hospital quality which could lead to further restrictions on hospital ownership by physicians 

  

in addition to the reforms enacted and considered by congress from time to time state legislatures periodically consider various health care reform proposals congress and state legislatures can be expected to continue to review and assess alternative health care delivery systems new regulatory enforcement initiatives and new payment methodologies 

  

we believe that government and private efforts to contain or reduce health care costs will continue these trends are likely to lead to reduced or slower growth in reimbursement for certain services provided by some of our tenants and mortgagors we believe the vast nature of the health care industry the financial strength and operating flexibility of our operators and the diversity of our portfolio will mitigate the impact of any such diminution in reimbursements however we cannot predict what legislation will be adopted and no assurance can be given the health care reforms will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 

  

employees 

  

at december 31 2004 the company had 74 fulltime employees and one parttime employee none of whom are subject to a collective bargaining agreement 

  

legal entities 

  

we conduct our business through various legal entities including the following at december 31 2004 

  

  

  

   

  

risk factors 

  

you should carefully consider the risks described below as well as the risks described in “competition” “government regulation” and “taxation of hcp” and elsewhere in this report which risks are incorporated by reference into this section before making an investment decision in our company the risks and uncertainties described herein are not the only ones facing us and there may be additional risks that we do not presently know of or that we currently consider not likely to have a significant impact all of these risks could adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

  

risks related to our operators 

  

if our tenants and mortgagors are unable to operate our properties in a manner sufficient to generate income they may be unable to make rent and loan payments to us 

  

the health care industry is highly competitive and we expect that it may become more competitive in the future our tenants and mortgagors are subject to competition from other health care providers that provide similar health care services including from newly constructed facilities the profitability of health care facilities depends upon several factors including the number of physicians using the health care facilities or referring patients there competitive systems of health care delivery and the size and composition of the population in the surrounding area private federal and state payment programs including a reduction in reimbursement by any of them and the effect of other laws and regulations may also have a significant influence on the revenues and income of the properties if our tenants and mortgagors are not competitive with other health care providers and are unable to generate income they may be unable to make rent and loan payments to us 

  

the bankruptcy insolvency or financial deterioration of our facility operators could significantly delay our ability to collect unpaid rents or require us to find new operators 

  

our financial position and our ability to make distributions to our stockholders may be adversely affected by financial difficulties experienced by any of our major operators including bankruptcy insolvency or a general downturn in the business or in the event any of our major operators do not renew or extend their relationship with us as their lease terms expire 

  

we are exposed to the risk that our operators may not be able to meet their obligations which may result in their bankruptcy or insolvency although our leases and loans provide us the right to terminate an investment evict an operator demand immediate repayment and other remedies the bankruptcy laws afford certain rights to a party that has filed for bankruptcy or reorganization an operator in bankruptcy may be able to restrict our ability to collect unpaid rents or interest during the bankruptcy proceeding 

  

tenet healthcare corporation accounts for a significant percentage of our revenues and is currently experiencing significant legal financial and regulatory difficulties 

  

during 2004 tenet healthcare corporation accounted for approximately 12 of our revenues according to public disclosures tenet is experiencing significant legal financial and regulatory difficulties we cannot predict with certainty the impact if any of the outcome of these uncertainties on our consolidated financial statements the failure or inability of tenet to pay its obligations could materially reduce our revenue net income and cash flows and could have a material adverse effect on the value of our common stock 

  

our operators are faced with increased litigation and rising insurance costs that may affect their ability to pay their lease or mortgage payments 

  

in some states advocacy groups have been created to monitor the quality of care at health care facilities and these groups have brought litigation against operators also in several instances private litigation by patients has succeeded in winning very large damage awards for alleged abuses the effect of this litigation and potential litigation has been to materially increase the costs of monitoring and reporting quality of care compliance incurred by our tenants in addition the cost of liability and medical malpractice insurance has increased and may continue to increase so long as the present litigation environment affecting the operations of health care facilities continues continued cost increases could cause our tenants to be unable to pay their lease or mortgage payments potentially decreasing our revenue and increasing our collection and litigation costs moreover to the extent we are required to take back the affected facilities our revenue from those facilities could be reduced or eliminated for an extended period of time 

  

risks related to real estate investment and our structure 

  

we rely on external sources of capital to fund future capital needs and if our access to such capital is difficult or on commercially unreasonable terms we may not be able to meet maturing commitments or make future investments necessary to grow our business 

  

in order to qualify as a reit under the internal revenue code among other things we are required to distribute to our stockholders at least 90 of our reit taxable income each year and we will be subject to tax to the extent we distribute less than 100 of our reit taxable income to our stockholders each year because of these distribution requirements we may not be able to fund all future capital needs including capital needs in connection with acquisitions from cash retained from operations as a result we rely on external sources of capital if we are unable to obtain needed capital at all or only on unfavorable terms from these sources we might not be able to make the investments needed to grow our business or to meet our obligations and commitments as they mature which could negatively affect the ratings of our debt and even in extreme circumstances affect our ability to continue operations our access to capital depends upon a number of factors over which we have little or no control including general market conditions interest rates the market’s perception of our growth potential our current and potential future earnings and our cash distributions and the market price of the shares of our capital stock 

  

if we are unable to purchase suitable health care facilities at a favorable cost we will be unable to continue to grow through acquisitions 

  

the acquisition and financing of health care facilities at favorable costs is highly competitive if we cannot identify and purchase a sufficient quantity of health care facilities at favorable prices or if we are unable to finance such acquisitions on commercially favorable terms our business will suffer 

  

unforeseen costs associated with the acquisition of new properties could reduce our profitability 

  

our business strategy contemplates future acquisitions the acquisitions we make may not prove to be successful we might encounter unanticipated difficulties and expenditures relating to any acquired properties including contingent liabilities we might never realize the anticipated benefits of an acquisition which could adversely affect our profitability 

  

since real estate investments are illiquid we may not be able to sell properties when we desire 

  

real estate investments generally cannot be sold quickly we may not be able to vary our portfolio promptly in response to vacancies or economic conditions this inability to respond to changes in the performance of our investments could adversely affect our ability to service debt and make distributions to our stockholders in addition there are limitations under the federal income tax laws applicable to reits that may limit our ability to recognize the full economic benefit from a sale of our assets 

  

transfers of health care facilities generally require regulatory approvals and alternative uses of health care facilities are limited 

  

because transfers of health care facilities may be subject to regulatory approvals not required for transfers of other types of commercial operations and other types of real estate there may be delays in transferring operations of our facilities to successor tenants or we may be prohibited from transferring operations to a successor tenant in addition many of our properties are health care facilities that may not be easily adapted to nonhealth care related uses if we are unable to transfer properties at times opportune to us our revenue and operations may suffer 

  

some potential losses may not be covered by insurance 

  

we generally require our tenants and mortgagors to secure and maintain comprehensive liability and property insurance that covers us as well as the tenants or mortgagors on most of our properties some types of losses however either may be uninsurable or too expensive to insure against should an uninsured loss or a loss in excess of insured limits occur we could lose all or a portion of the capital we have invested in a property as well as the anticipated future revenue from the property in such an event we might nevertheless remain obligated for any mortgage debt or other financial obligations related to the property we cannot assure you that material losses in excess of insurance proceeds will not occur in the future 

  

loss of our tax status as a reit would have significant adverse consequences to us 

  

we believe we currently operate and have operated commencing with our taxable year ended december 31 1985 in a manner that allows us to qualify as a reit for federal income tax purposes under the internal revenue code as amended 

  

qualification as a reit involves the application of highly technical and complex internal revenue code provisions for which there are only limited judicial and administrative interpretations the determination of various factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control may affect our ability to qualify as a reit for example in order to qualify as a reit at least 95 of our gross income in any year must be derived from qualifying sources and we must satisfy a number of requirements regarding the composition of our assets also we must make distributions to stockholders aggregating annually at least 90 of our reit taxable income excluding capital gains in addition new legislation regulations administrative interpretations or court decisions may adversely affect our investors or our ability to qualify as a reit for tax purposes although we believe that we have been organized and have operated in such manner we can give no assurance that we have qualified or will continue to qualify as a reit for tax purposes 

  

if we lose our reit status we will face serious tax consequences that will substantially reduce the funds available to make payments of principal and interest on the debt securities we issue and to make distributions to our stockholders if we fail to qualify as a reit 

  

   

   

   

in addition if we fail to qualify as a reit we would not be required to make distributions to stockholders 

  

as a result of all these factors our failure to qualify as a reit also could impair our ability to expand our business and raise capital and could adversely affect the value of our common stock

we undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forwardlooking statements whether as a result of new information future events or otherwise 

  

executive summary 

  

we are a real estate investment trust “reit” that invests in health care related properties located throughout the united states we develop acquire and manage health care real estate and provide mortgage financing to health care providers we invest directly often structuring saleleaseback transactions and through joint ventures at december 31 2004 our real estate portfolio including those held through joint ventures and mortgage loans consisted of interests in 527 facilities located in 43 states 

  

the current operating environment presents many business challenges including i the prospect of rising interest rates ii unprecedented state and federal budget deficits that are likely to dampen government reimbursement to the medicare and medicaid programs in the years to come and iii a healthcare system in the united states that is projected to increase from 153 of gross domestic product “gdp” to 177 of gdp by 2012 according to the centers for medicare and medicaid services furthermore health care real estate valuations are at unprecedented high levels driven in part by the emergence of new wellcapitalized entrants into the health care real estate marketplace 

  

our business strategy is based on three principles i opportunistic investing ii portfolio diversification and iii conservative financing we actively redeploy capital from investments with lower return potential into assets with higher return potential and recycle capital from shorter term to longer term investments we make investments where the expected riskadjusted return exceeds our cost of capital and strive to leverage our operator and other business relationships 

  

our strategy contemplates acquiring and developing properties on favorable terms we attempt to structure transactions that are taxadvantaged and mitigate risks in our underwriting process generally we prefer larger more complex “negotiated” transactions that leverage our management team’s experience and infrastructure during 2004 we made gross investments of 538 million including 70 million of mob development properties placed into service midyear these investments had an average first year yield on cost of just over 9 and allowed us to recycle 100 million of capital with two operators — arc and emeritus — from shorter term loans into long term leases our 2004 net investments of 438 million were allocated among the following healthcare sectors i 23 assisted living facilities and ccrcs ii 19 skilled nursing facilities iii 49 mobs and iv 9 life sciences properties 

  

we follow a disciplined approach to enhancing the value of our existing portfolio including the ongoing evaluation of properties for potential disposition that no longer fit our strategy we sold 32 properties during 2004 for 170 million and had 12 properties with a carrying amount of 130 million as held for sale at yearend 

  

we primarily generate revenue by leasing health care related properties under longterm operating leases most of our rents are received under triple net leases however mob rents are typically structured as gross or modified gross leases accordingly for mobs we incur certain property operating expenses such as real estate taxes repairs and maintenance property management fees utilities and insurance our growth depends in part on our ability to i increase rental income by increasing occupancy levels and rental rates ii maximize tenant recoveries and iii control operating and other expenses our operations are impacted by property specific market specific general economic and other conditions 

  

access to external capital on favorable terms is critical to the success of our strategy we attempt to match the longterm duration of our leases with longterm fixed rate financing at december 31 2004 23 of our consolidated debt is at variable interest rates we intend to maintain an investment grade rating on our fixed income securities and manage various capital ratios and amounts within appropriate parameters our senior debt is rated bbb by both standard  poor’s and fitch ratings and baa2 by moody’s investors service 

  

capital market access impacts our cost of capital and our ability to refinance existing indebtedness as it matures as well as to fund future acquisitions and development through the issuance of additional securities our ability to access capital on favorable terms is dependent on various factors including general market conditions interest rates credit ratings on our securities perception of our potential future earnings and cash distributions and the market price of our capital stock

critical accounting policies 

  

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” requires management to use judgment in the application of accounting policies including making estimates and assumptions we base estimates on our experience and on various other assumptions believed to be reasonable under the circumstances these judgments affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods if our judgment or interpretation of the facts and circumstances relating to various transactions or other matters had been different it is possible that different accounting would have been applied resulting in a different presentation of our financial statements from time to time we reevaluate our estimates and assumptions in the event estimates or assumptions prove to be different from actual results adjustments are made in subsequent periods to reflect more current estimates and assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain 

  

revenue recognition 

  

rental income from tenants is our principal source of revenue and is recognized in accordance with gaap including securities and exchange commission “sec” staff accounting bulletin no 104 revenue recognition “sab 104” for leases with minimum scheduled rent increases we recognize income on a straightline basis over the lease term when collectibility is reasonably assured recognizing rental income on a straightline basis for leases results in recognized revenue exceeding amounts contractually due from the tenant such cumulative excess amounts are included in other assets in our consolidated balance sheets in the event we determine that collectibility of amounts for straightline rents is not reasonably assured we limit future recognition to amounts contractually owed and where appropriate we establish an allowance for estimated losses 

  

we monitor the liquidity and creditworthiness of our tenants and borrowers on an ongoing basis our evaluation considers industry and economic conditions property performance security deposits and guarantees and other matters we establish provisions and maintain an allowance for estimated losses resulting from the possible inability of our tenants and borrowers to make payments sufficient to recover recognized assets for straightline rent amounts our assessment is based on income recoverable over the term of the lease our ability to assess the collectibility potential of amounts to be received from tenants and borrowers directly affects our reported financial position and results of operations 

  

real estate 

  

real estate consisting of land buildings and improvements is recorded at cost we allocate the cost of the acquisition to the acquired tangible and identified intangible assets and liabilities primarily lease related 

  

intangibles based on their estimated fair values in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards “sfas” no 141 business combinations  

  

we assess fair value based on estimated cash flow projections that utilize appropriate discount andor capitalization rates as well as available market information estimates of future cash flows are based on a number of factors including historical operating results known and anticipated trends and market and economic conditions the fair value of the tangible assets of an acquired property considers the value of the property as if it were vacant 

  

we record acquired “above and below” market leases at their fair value using a discount rate which reflects the risks associated with the leases acquired equal to the difference between i the contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to each inplace lease and ii management’s estimate of fair market lease rates for each corresponding inplace lease measured over a period equal to the remaining term of the lease for abovemarket leases and the initial term plus the term of any belowmarket fixedrate renewal options for belowmarket leases other intangible assets acquired include amounts for inplace lease values that are based on our evaluation of the specific characteristics of each tenant’s lease factors to be considered include estimates of carrying costs during hypothetical expected leaseup periods market conditions and costs to execute similar leases in estimating carrying costs we include real estate taxes insurance and other operating expenses and estimates of lost rentals at market rates during the expected leaseup periods depending on local market conditions in estimating costs to execute similar leases we consider leasing commissions legal and other related costs 

  

real estate assets are periodically reviewed for potential impairment by comparing the carrying amount to the expected undiscounted future cash flows to be generated from the assets if the sum of the expected future net undiscounted cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the property we will recognize an impairment loss by adjusting the asset’s carrying amount to its estimated fair value fair value for properties to be held and used is based on the present value of the future cash flows expected to be generated from the asset properties held for sale are recorded at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less costs to dispose our ability to accurately predict future cash flows impacts the determination of fair value which may significantly impact our reported results of operations 

  

consolidation and investments in joint ventures 

  

our consolidated financial statements include the accounts of health care property investors inc its wholly owned subsidiaries and its controlled through voting rights or other means joint ventures we adopted interpretation no 46r consolidation of variable interest entities  an interpretation of accounting research bulletin no 51” “fin 46” effective january 1 2004 for variable interest entities created before february 1 2003 and effective january 1 2003 for variable interest entities created after january 31 2003 fin 46 provides guidance on the identification of entities for which control is achieved through means other than voting rights “variable interest entities” or “vies” and the determination of which business enterprise is the primary beneficiary of the vie application of fin 46 requires complex judgments and estimates our ability to correctly assess our influence or control over an entity affects our reported financial condition and results of operations a variable interest entity is broadly defined as an entity where either i the equity investors as a group if any do not have a controlling financial interest or ii the equity investment at risk is insufficient to finance that entity’s activities without additional financial support we consolidate investments in vies when we determine that we are the primary beneficiary of the vie the adoption of fin 46 resulted in the consolidation of five joint ventures effective january 1 2004 that were previously accounted for under the equity method the consolidation of these joint ventures did not have a significant effect on our consolidated financial statements or results of operations 

  

investments in entities in which we do not consolidate but over which we have the ability to exercise significant influence over operating and financial policies are reported under the equity method generally under the equity method of accounting our share of the investee’s earnings or loss is included in our operating results 

  

results of operations 

  

year ended december 31 2004 as compared to year ended december 31 2003 

  

rental income triple net rental income increased 17 to 2801 million primarily due to acquisitions completed in 2004 we also recognized 57 million of rental income during the fourth quarter of 2004 resulting from a change in estimate related to the collectibility of straightline rental income from arc the consolidation of five joint ventures upon the adoption of fin 46 effective january 2004 increased reported triple net rental income by approximately 28 million 

  

medical office building rental income increased 28 to 1086 million in 2004 the increase is primarily related to 13 properties purchased from medcap in october 2003 including four development properties we placed in service in mid2004 and other mob acquisition activities 

  

equity income equity income from unconsolidated joint ventures reflects a full year of operations from hcp mop in 2004 versus three months in 2003 this was offset by higher hcp mop interest expense following hcp mop obtaining 288 million of nonrecourse mortgage debt in early 2004 during 2004 and 2003 we recognized 15 million and 17 million of equity income from hcp mop respectively at december 31 2004 100 properties were held by unconsolidated joint ventures including hcp mop compared to 115 properties at december 31 2003 

  

interest and other income interest and other income for 2004 was 379 million representing a decline of 22 the change reflects the net effects of i 46 million of revenue from the recognition of arc related interest income upon the repayment during 2004 to us by arc of 83 million of debt and accrued interest thereon and ii a reduced level of loans receivable following the aforementioned repayment from arc and a 17 million repayment from emeritus during 2004 and 2003 we also recognized management and other fees from hcp mop of 31 million and 25 million respectively other income in 2003 includes a 34 million tax related accrual reversal related to our 1999 acquisition of american health properties 

  

interest expense interest expense increased slightly over 2003 the increase was due to the net effects of i the assumption of 81 million of mortgage debt in conjunction with the arc and emeritus transactions in july 2004 ii the retirement of 31 million of mortgage debt in the first quarter of 2004 in connection with the sale of 127 million of mob and other health care properties and iii other changes in average borrowings levels interest expense in 2004 also included 08 million of previously unamortized deferred financing costs that were written off in connection with the refinancing of our revolving credit agreement 

  

operating costs and expenses operating costs were 433 million during 2004 representing an increase of 33 operating costs are predominately related to mob properties that are leased under gross or modified gross lease agreements where we share certain costs with tenants additionally we contract with third party property managers on most of our mob properties accordingly the number of properties in our mob portfolio directly impacts operating costs the increases were primarily attributable to the acquisition of 13 properties from medcap in october 2003 including four development properties we placed in service in mid2004 in the fourth quarter of 2004 we increased our allowance for loan losses by 16 million on certain unsecured loans the provision resulted from one operator who defaulted on the payment of two of four unsecured notes upon their maturity and our recent credit assessment of another operator 

  

general and administrative expenses  general and administrative expenses were 360 million in 2004 compared to 244 million in 2003 primarily reflecting higher employee compensation costs also contributing to the increase was 07 million in expenses associated with the move of our corporate offices to long beach ca 15 million in income tax expense on income from certain assets held in a trs and a charge of 16 million related to the settlement of a lawsuit filed against us by our former executive vice president and chief financial officer additionally during 2004 we implemented a new information 

  

technology system to enhance our reporting and asset management activities and expended considerable resources towards compliance with recent regulatory requirements principally the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 

  

depreciation and amortization  real estate depreciation and amortization increased primarily due to the acquisition and construction of properties aggregating approximately 538 million during 2004 and 239 million during 2003 

  

impairments  impairment losses on real estate were 171 million in 2004 and 140 million in 2003 included in continuing operations were impairments of 32 million and 21 million for 2004 and 2003 respectively which relate to two and one properties respectively 

  

discontinued operations  income from discontinued operations for 2004 and 2003 were 112 million and 126 million respectively the decrease is due to a decline in operating income from discontinued operations of 84 million to 40 million for 2004 partially offset by a net gain on real estate dispositions and impairments of 72 million in 2004 compared to a net gain on real estate dispositions and impairments of 02 million in 2003 

  

year ended december 31 2003 as compared to year ended december 31 2002 

  

rental income  triple net related income increased 6 to 2402 million during 2003 primarily attributable to acquisitions mob rental income for 2003 increased 17 primarily due to acquisition and development activity 

  

equity income  equity income from unconsolidated joint ventures was 29 million for 2003 compared to 09 million in 2002 reflecting our investment in hcp mop in october 2003 during 2003 we recognized 17 million of equity income from hcp mop at december 31 2003 115 properties were held by unconsolidated joint ventures including hcp mop compared to 19 properties at december 31 2002 

  

interest and other income  interest and other income increased primarily due to the september 2002 loan to arc as well as a partial prepayment of that loan in september 2003 other income in 2003 includes a 34 million tax related accrual reversal related to our 1999 acquisition of american health properties 

  

interest expense  interest expense was higher in 2003 due to the issuance of 200 million principal amount of 6 long term debt in february 2003 and 250 million principal amount of 645 long term debt in june 2002 

  

operating cost and expenses  operating costs were 325 million for 2003 representing an increase of 28 the increase was primarily attributable to the acquisition of 13 properties from medcap in october 2003 

  

general and administrative  general and administrative expenses increased 31 to 244 million for 2003 higher general and administrative expenses were caused by costs related to vacant properties an increase in troubled operators duplicate asset management functions resulting from the acquisition and transition of medcap and higher employee compensation costs 

  

depreciation and amortization  real estate depreciation and amortization increased 8 to 733 million as a result of the acquisition of properties totaling approximately 239 million during 2003 and 233 million in 2002

preferred stock redemptions  preferred stock redemption charges were 186 million in 2003 and relate to the repurchase of outstanding preferred stock at an amount in excess of the carrying amount 

  

discontinued operations  the increase in income from discontinued operations for 2003 is due to a net gain on real estate dispositions and impairments of 02 million compared to a net loss on real estate dispositions and impairments of 103 million in 2002 partially offset by a decline in operating income from discontinued operations of 50 million to 124 million for 2003 from 174 million in 2002 discontinued operations include impairment charges of 119 million and 110 million for 2003 and 2002 respectively 

  

liquidity and capital resources 

  

our principal liquidity needs are to i fund normal operating expenses ii meet debt service requirements iii fund capital expenditures including tenant improvements and leasing costs iv fund acquisition and development activities and v make minimum distributions required to maintain our reit qualification under the internal revenue code as amended 

  

we believe these needs will be satisfied using cash flows generated by operations and provided by financing activities we intend to repay maturing debt with proceeds from future debt andor equity offerings and anticipate making future investments dependent on the availability of costeffective sources of capital we use the public debt and equity markets as our principal source of financing as of december 31 2004 our senior debt is rated bbb by both standard  poor’s ratings group and fitch ratings and baa2 by moody’s investors service 

  

net cash provided by operating activities was 2725 million and 2636 million for 2004 and 2003 respectively cash flow from operations reflects increased revenues offset by higher costs and expenses and changes in receivables payables accruals and deferred revenue our cash flows from operations are dependent upon the occupancy level of multitenant buildings rental rates on leases our tenants’ performance on their lease obligations the level of operating expenses and other factors see item 7 — management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations — results of operations 

  

net cash used in investing activities was 820 million during 2004 and principally reflects the net effect of i 1276 million received from the sale of seven medical office buildings and 10 other health care related facilities in the first quarter ii 3409 million principally used to fund acquisitions iii 920 million received from hcp mop upon the completion of 288 million of nonrecourse mortgage financing and iv 256 million in principal repayments received on loans the arc and emeritus transactions retired approximately 100 million of aggregate loans owed to us simultaneously with the related property acquisitions accordingly this portion of these transactions has been considered a noncash activity see note 12 to the consolidated financial statements during 2004 and 2003 we used 34 million and 65 million to fund lease commissions and tenant and capital improvements respectively 

  

net cash used in financing activities was 1878 million for 2004 and includes i the repayment of approximately 920 million of senior notes ii payment of common and preferred dividends aggregating 2433 million and iii repayments on mortgage debt of 694 million including 566 million of debt we assumed in connection with the emeritus transaction these uses were partially offset by proceeds of 426 million from common stock issuances 870 million from senior note issuances and 1021 million from net proceeds on our line of credit in order to qualify as a reit for federal income tax purposes we must distribute at least 90 of our taxable income to our shareholders accordingly we intend to continue to make regular quarterly distributions to holders of our common and preferred stock 

  

at december 31 2004 we held approximately 169 million in deposits and 276 million in irrevocable letters of credit from commercial banks securing tenants’ lease obligations and borrowers’ loan obligations we may draw upon the letters of credit or depository accounts if there are defaults under the related leases or loans amounts available under letters of credit could change based upon facility operating conditions and other factors and such changes may be material 

  

debt 

  

at december 31 2004 we have the following outstanding debt 

  

revolving line of credit borrowings under the line of credit were 300 million at december 31 2004 with a weighted average interest rate of 314 on october 26 2004 we closed a new 500 million threeyear unsecured revolving credit facility the facility accrues interest based on our current credit ratings at 65 basis points over libor with a 15 basis point facility fee in addition a competitive bid option whereby the lenders participating in the credit facility bid on the interest to be charged which may result in a reduced interest rate is available for up to 50 of borrowings the credit facility also contains an “accordion” feature allowing borrowings to be increased by 100 million in certain conditions 

  

the new credit agreement contains certain financial restrictions and requirements customary in transactions of this type the more significant covenants using terms defined in the agreements limit i consolidated total indebtedness to consolidated total asset value to 60 ii secured debt to consolidated total asset value to 30 and iii unsecured debt to consolidated unencumbered asset value to 60 we must also maintain i a fixed charge coverage ratio as defined of 175 times and ii a formuladetermined minimum tangible net worth as of december 31 2004 we were in compliance with each of these restrictions and requirements 

  

mortgage debt at december 31 2004 we had 1394 million in mortgage debt secured by 28 health care facilities with a carrying amount of 2684 million interest rates on the mortgage notes ranged from 107 to 932 with a weighted average rate of 786 at december 31 2004 

  

the instruments encumbering the properties restrict title transfer of the respective properties subject to the terms of the mortgage prohibit additional liens require payment of real estate taxes maintenance of the properties in good condition maintenance of insurance on the properties and include a requirement to obtain lender consent to enter into material tenant leases 

  

senior unsecured notes at december 31 2004 we had 10 billion in aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes outstanding interest rates on the notes ranged from 339 to 7875 with a weighted average rate of 655 at december 31 2004 

  

senior unsecured notes include 200 million principal amount of 6875 mandatory par put remarketed securities “mopprs” due june 8 2015 the mopprs contain an option the “mopprs option” exercisable by the remarketing dealer an investment bank affiliate which derives its value from the yield on tenyear us treasury rates relative to a fixed strike rate of 5565 generally the value of the option to the remarketing dealer increases as tenyear treasury rates decline and the option’s value to the remarketing dealer decreases as tenyear treasury rates rise the ten year us treasury rate at december 31 2004 was 424 the value of this option to the remarketing dealer approximated 20 million at december 31 2004 conversely such amount represents a potential unrecognized loss to us 

  

on june 8 2005 if the tenyear treasury rate is less than 5565 we expect that the remarketing dealer will exercise the mopprs option redeem the securities from the holders at par plus accrued interest and reissue the senior notes as tenyear notes at a premium based on a fixed coupon interest rate set at our applicable credit spread plus 5565 however if the tenyear treasury rate is above 5565 we expect that the remarketing dealer will redeem the outstanding senior notes and we will be required to repurchase the outstanding mopprs at par plus accrued interest

see liquidity and capital resources — debt for a discussion of the mopprs option related to our senior unsecured notes 

  

inflation 

  

our leases often provide for either fixed increases in base rents or indexed escalators based on the consumer price index or other measures andor additional rent based on increases in our tenant’s facility revenue substantially all of our mob leases require the tenant to pay a share of property operating costs such as real estate taxes insurance utilities etc we believe that inflationary increases in expenses will be offset in part by the tenant expense reimbursements and contractual rent increases described above

fluctuation in the interest rate environment will not affect our future earnings and cash flows on our fixed rate debt until that debt must be replaced or refinanced however interest rate changes will affect the fair value of our fixed rate instruments conversely changes in interest rates on variable rate debt would change our future earnings and cash flows but not affect the fair value of those instruments assuming a one percentage point increase in the interest rate related to the variablerate debt including the mortgage notes payable the bank line of credit and senior notes and assuming no change in the outstanding balance as of december 31 2004 interest expense for 2004 would increase by approximately 34 million or 003 per common share on a diluted basis 

  

the principal amount and the average interest rates for our mortgage loans receivable and debt categorized by maturity dates is presented in the table below the fair value estimates for the mortgage loans receivable are based on the estimates of management and on rates currently prevailing for comparable loans the fair market value estimates for debt securities are based on discounting future cash flows utilizing current rates offered to us for debt of the same type and remaining maturity

the board of directors and stockholders of health care property investors inc

business strategy 

  

we are organized to invest in incomeproducing health care related facilities our primary goal is to increase shareholder value through profitable growth our investment strategy to achieve this goal is based on three principles — an opportunistic investing approach portfolio diversification and a conservative balance sheet 

  

opportunistic investing approach 

  

we complete real estate transactions when they are expected to drive profitable growth and create longterm stockholder value we attempt to position ourselves to create and take advantage of opportunities when we believe the opportunities meet our goals and investment criteria we may invest in properties directly through joint ventures or provide secured financing depending on the dynamics of the investment opportunity 

  

portfolio diversification 

  

we believe in maintaining a diversified portfolio of heath care related real estate diversification within the health care industry reduces the likelihood that a single event would materially harm our business this allows us to take advantage of opportunities in different markets based on individual market dynamics while pursuing our strategy of attaining diversification in our portfolio there are no limitations on the percentage of our total assets that may be invested in any one property joint venture property type geographic location or in the number of properties in which we seek to invest or lease to a single operator 

  

conservative balance sheet 

  

we believe a conservative balance sheet provides us with the ability to execute on our opportunistic investing approach and portfolio diversification principles we execute our conservative balance sheet strategy through managing our debt to equity levels and maintaining available sources of liquidity such as under our line of credit additionally our debt is primarily fixed rate which reduces the impact of rising interest rates on our results of operations rising interest rates will not significantly impact our future earnings until our debt matures and must be repaid or refinanced 

  

we finance our investments based on our evaluation of available sources of funding we may incur additional indebtedness or issue preferred or common stock when in the opinion of our management and directors it is advisable for shortterm purposes we from time to time negotiate lines of credit or arrange for other shortterm borrowings from banks or others we arrange for longterm borrowings through public offerings or from institutional investors 

  

in addition we may incur additional mortgage indebtedness on real estate we have acquired through purchase foreclosure or otherwise where properties are encumbered by debt with terms deemed favorable we will assume existing loans mortgages deeds of trust or similar liens on the properties we also may obtain nonrecourse or other mortgage financing on unleveraged properties in which we have invested or may refinance properties acquired on a leveraged basis 

  

competition 

  

our properties are subject to competition from the properties of other health care providers the operators of these competing properties may have capital resources substantially in excess of some of the operators of our facilities in addition the extent to which our properties are utilized depends upon several factors including the number of physicians using the health care facilities or referring patients to the facilities competitive systems of health care delivery and the size and composition of the population in the surrounding area private federal and state payment programs and the effect of other laws and regulations may also have a significant influence on the utilization of the properties virtually all of the properties operate in a competitive environment with patients and referral sources including physicians changing their preferences for a health care facility from time to time 

  

investing in real estate is highly competitive we face competition from other reits investment companies lessees and other investors when we attempt to acquire or sell properties increased competition reduces the number of opportunities that meet our investment criteria if we do not identify investments that meet our investment criteria our ability to increase shareholder value through profitable growth may be limited

portfolio summary 

  

our portfolio of investments includes direct investments in health care related properties joint ventures and mortgage loans our properties include hospitals longterm care facilities assisted and retirement living facilities medical office buildings and other health care facilities as of december 31 2003 our property investments including those through joint ventures and mortgage loans consist of the following dollar amounts in thousands 

  

   

   

   

   

property types 

  

we have investments in hospitals longterm care facilities assisted and retirement living facilities medical office buildings and other health care facilities the following describes the nature of the operations of our tenants and borrowers in those investments 

  

hospitals  we have an interest in 31 general and longterm acute care and rehabilitation hospitals general hospitals offer a wide range of services such as fullyequipped operating and recovery rooms obstetrics radiology intensive care open heart surgery and coronary care neurosurgery neonatal intensive care magnetic resonance imaging nursing units oncology clinical laboratories respiratory therapy physical therapy nuclear medicine rehabilitation services and outpatient services longterm acute care hospitals provide care for patients with complex medical conditions that require more intensive care monitoring or emergency backup than that available in most skilled nursingbased subacute programs services are paid for by private sources third party payors eg insurance and hmos or through the federal medicare and state medicaid programs medicare provides reimbursement incentives to traditional general acute care hospitals to minimize inpatient length of stay 

  

rehabilitation hospitals provide inpatient and outpatient care for patients who have sustained traumatic injuries or illnesses such as spinal cord injuries strokes head injuries orthopedic problems work related disabilities and neurological 

  

diseases as well as treatment for amputees and patients with severe arthritis rehabilitation programs encompass physical occupational speech and inhalation therapies rehabilitative nursing and other specialties services are paid for by the patient or the patient’s family third party payors eg insurance and hmos or through the federal medicare program 

  

longterm care facilities  we have invested in 173 longterm care facilities various health care providers operate these facilities longterm care facilities offer restorative rehabilitative and custodial nursing care for people not requiring the more extensive and sophisticated treatment available at hospitals ancillary revenues and revenue from subacute care services are derived from providing services to residents beyond room and board and include occupational physical speech respiratory and intravenous therapy wound care oncology treatment brain injury care and orthopedic therapy as well as sales of pharmaceutical products and other services certain longterm care facilities provide some of the foregoing services on an outpatient basis longterm care facilities are designed to supplement hospital care and depend to some degree upon referrals from practicing physicians and hospitals longterm care services are paid for either by private sources or through the federal medicare and state medicaid programs 

  

longterm care facilities generally provide patients with accommodation complete medical and nursing care and rehabilitation services including speech physical and occupational therapy as a part of the omnibus budget reconciliation act obra of 1981 congress established a waiver program under medicaid to offer an alternative to institutional longterm care services the provisions of obra and the subsequent obra acts of 1987 and 1990 allow states with federal approval greater flexibility in program design as a means of developing costeffective alternatives to delivering services traditionally provided in the longterm care setting this was a contributing factor to the past increase in the number of assisted living facilities which adversely affected some longterm care facilities as some individuals chose the residential environment and lower cost delivery system provided in the assisted living setting 

  

certain temporary medicare addon payments expired in october 2002 causing a decline in medicare reimbursement to nursing homes of approximately 9 as of october 1 2002 however the annual market basket increase to medicare rates for longterm care facilities and a prospective payment correction took effect october 1 2003 partially offsetting the forgoing and resulting in an aggregate 6 increase in medicare rates in addition most state medicaid rates were increased slightly providing further revenue and sector stabilization 

  

assisted and retirement living facilities  we have investments in 110 assisted living facilities offering studio and one and two bedroom apartments on a monthtomonth basis primarily to individuals who are over 75 years of age with various levels of assistance requirements more ambulatory residents are provided meals and eat in a central dining area they may also be assisted with some daily living activities with programs and services that allow residents certain conveniences and make it possible for them to live independently staff is also available when residents need assistance and for group activities services provided to residents who require more assistance with daily living activities but who do not require the constant supervision other longterm care facilities provide include personal supervision and assistance with eating bathing grooming and administering medication charges for room and board are generally paid from private sources 

  

we have investments in 14 retirement living communities these communities are large upscale residential communities in a congregate care and continuing care living setting combined with onsite amenities and services residents are provided the comfort security and convenience of residing within an aging in place environment eliminating the need to seek other living accommodations or arrangement for appropriate levels of care ancillary and health care services are available at those properties that provide nursing and assisted living care the full continuum of senior living environment includes independent living apartments and cottages assisted living and in some communities skilled nursing and alzheimer’s care various accommodation terms are available to residents including monthly rentals rental life care fully refundable entrance fees nonrefundable endowments cooperatives and condominiums 

  

medical office buildings  we have investments in 196 medical office buildings including a 33 ownership interest in 105 medical office buildings through our joint venture with ge many of these buildings are located adjacent to or on the campus of acute care hospitals medical office buildings contain physicians’ offices and examination rooms and may also include pharmacies hospital ancillary service space and daysurgery operating rooms medical office buildings require more extensive plumbing electrical heating and cooling capabilities than commercial office buildings for sinks brighter lights special equipment and biological waste mechanisms required for the proper operation of a medical office of our owned medical office buildings 16 are leased on a single tenant triple net basis while 75 are managed by third party property management companies and are leased under triple net gross or modified gross leases under which we are responsible for certain operating expenses

three hundred eleven of our properties are triple net leased to single tenant operators and 92 of our properties are managed by independent property management companies on our behalf the properties managed by independent property management companies are leased under triple net gross or modified gross leases with single or multiple tenants 

  

the initial annual base rental rates on our triple net leased portfolio of properties that we acquired during the three years ended december 31 2003 have generally ranged from 10 to 13 of the acquisition price of the related property initial interest rates on the loans we entered into as lender during the three years ended december 31 2003 have generally ranged from 13 to 19 per annum rental rates vary by lease taking into consideration many factors such as 

  

   

   

   

   

   

certain leases provide for additional rents that are based upon a percentage of the tenant’s revenue in excess of the revenue for a specific base period others have rent increases based on inflation indices or other factors and some leases and loans have annual fixed rent or interest rate increases 

  

in addition to the minimum and additional rents the tenant under a triple net lease is generally responsible for all additional charges including charges related to nonpayment or late payment of rent property taxes and assessments governmental charges and utility and other charges each triple net tenant is required at its expense to maintain its leased property in good order and repair we are generally not required to repair rebuild or maintain the properties leased under triple net leases

the primary or fixed terms of the triple net and modified gross leases generally range from ten to 15 years and generally have one or more fiveyear or longer renewal options the weighted average remaining primary or fixed term on our triple net and modified gross leases in our portfolio is approximately eight years the primary or fixed term of our medical office buildings gross leases range from one to 15 years with a weighted average of five years remaining on those leases

certain of our properties are subject to purchase options with the tenant the following table reflects future minimum lease payments to be received under noncancelable leases subject to purchase options dollar amounts in thousands

tenet healthcare corporation 

  

during the year ended december 31 2003 tenet healthcare corporation tenet leased eight acute care hospitals and one medical office building from us revenue from tenet properties constituted approximately 16 of our 2003 revenue less operating expenses one of the hospital leases is scheduled to expire on may 31 2005 tenet can renew that lease for an additional five years by providing notice at least 180 days prior to lease expiration tenet exercised fiveyear extensions on six facility leases  five with terms now set to expire in february 2009 and one now set to expire in may 2009 in october 2003 tenet assigned the lease for a hospital located in poplar bluff missouri to health management associates hma hma is a health care services operator with hospitals concentrated primarily in the southeast and southwest areas of the united states the lease on that hospital provided for rent of 3700000 for 2003 and has a lease term set to expire in february 2009 as of december 31 2003 we have an investment of 423773000 in the remaining seven facilities leased to tenet 

  

one of our hospitals located in tarzana california and operated by tenet under a lease expiring in february 2009 is affected by state of california senate bill 1953 sb 1953 which requires certain seismic safety building standards for acute care hospital facilities we are currently reviewing along with tenet the sb 1953 compliance of this hospital multiple plans of action to cause such compliance the estimated time for completing the same and the cost of performing necessary remediation of the property we cannot currently estimate the potential costs of sb 1953 compliance with respect to the affected hospital or the final allocation of such costs between tenet and us rent on the hospital in 2003 was 108 million and the net book value is 81 million 

  

tenet announced its adoption of new policies as of january 1 2003 for calculating medicare reimbursement for patients who require high cost treatments outlier payments which has led to reduced revenues at certain of its hospitals cash flow coverage of rents for the tenet hospitals was 43 for the twelve months ended september 30 2003 this is down from a coverage level of 51 for the twelve months ended september 30 2002 

  

according to public disclosures by tenet tenet is undergoing an investigation by the securities and exchange commission relating to its billing practices and financial disclosures the united states department of justice is suing tenet over medicare fraud allegations the us attorney’s office is investigating tenet’s use on physician relocation agreements certain contractual matters related to physicians and others and medicare outlier payments a federal grand jury has returned an indictment accusing a subsidiary of tenet of illegal use of physician relocation agreements the internal revenue service has assessed a 157 million tax deficiency with interest of 118 million as of september 30 2003 against tenet the united states senate finance committee is investigating tenet’s corporate governance practices with respect to federal health care programs tenet is litigating several federal securities class action and shareholder derivative suits and several state law actions tenet is litigating a qui tam action in florida regarding alleged illegal kickbacks the united states department of health and human services is investigating tenet’s relationship with the women’s cancer center a former executive of tenet received a 148 million judgment against tenet for certain stock incentive awards and tenet is subject to other federal and state investigations regarding its business practices tenet is responding to a justice department subpoena regarding the outlier payments at the company’s tarzana facility 

  

on march 9 2004 tenet announced that it amended its bank credit agreement which reduced the aggregate commitments available under the revolving credit facility including funded loans and letters of credit from 1200000000 to 800000000 with a limit on funded loans of 500000000 and letters of credit of 300000000 tenet also announced that currently there are no funded loans and 215000000 of letters of credit are outstanding 

  

we cannot predict the impact if any that these recent developments may have on individual hospital performances and the related lease payments due to us by tenet the failure or inability of tenet to pay its obligations to us could materially reduce our revenues and net income which could in turn reduce the amount of dividends we pay to our stockholders and cause our stock price to decline 

  

healthsouth corporation 

  

during 2003 5 of our 2003 revenue less operating expenses was generated from facilities leased to healthsouth corporation healthsouth primarily from nine rehabilitation hospitals in march 2003 the securities and exchange commission charged healthsouth and its former chief executive officer with inflating earnings and overstating assets and as a result healthsouth has announced that its previous financial statements should not be relied upon healthsouth has announced that it is undergoing a financial audit and forensic examination to assess the accuracy of its financial information in october 2003 healthsouth announced that it paid its semiannual interest payments to bondholders and announced its intention to remain current on all interest payments on january 16 2004 healthsouth announced the refinancing of a subordinated debt issue and that it is now current on all of its outstanding principal and interest payments due under healthsouth’s various borrowing agreements the nine rehabilitation hospitals leased by healthsouth have an average remaining lease term of four years not taking into account renewal options the average age of these hospitals is 14 years fourth quarter 2003 occupancy for the nine facilities as provided by healthsouth ranged from 58 to 99 with an average occupancy of 75 healthsouth is current on rent payments through march 2004 

  

joint ventures 

  

consolidated joint ventures 

  

at december 31 2003 we had varying percentage interests in several limited liability companies and partnerships that together own 193 facilities and one mortgage as follows 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

unconsolidated joint ventures 

  

   

   

   

   

taxation of hcp 

  

we believe that we have operated in such a manner as to qualify for taxation as a reit under sections 856 to 860 of the internal revenue code of 1986 as amended the “code” commencing with our taxable year ended december 31 1985 and we intend to continue to operate in such a manner no assurance can be given that we have operated or will be able to continue to operate in a manner so as to qualify or to remain so qualified this summary is qualified in its entirety by the applicable code provisions rules and regulations promulgated thereunder and administrative and judicial interpretations thereof 

  

if we qualify for taxation as a reit we will generally not be required to pay federal corporate income taxes on the portion of our net income that is currently distributed to stockholders this treatment substantially eliminates the “double taxation” ie at the corporate and stockholder levels that generally results from investment in a corporation however we will be required to pay federal income tax under certain circumstances 

  

the code defines a reit as a corporation trust or association i which is managed by one or more trustees or directors ii the beneficial ownership of which is evidenced by transferable shares or by transferable certificates of beneficial interest iii which would be taxable but for sections 856 through 860 of the code as a domestic corporation iv which is neither a financial institution nor an insurance company subject to certain provisions of the code v the beneficial ownership of which is held by 100 or more persons vi during the last half of each taxable year not more than 50 in value of the outstanding stock of which is owned actually or constructively by five or fewer individuals and vii which meets certain other tests described below regarding the amount of its distributions and the nature of its income and assets the code provides that conditions i to iv inclusive must be met during the entire taxable year and that condition v must be met during at least 335 days of a taxable year of 12 months or during a proportionate part of a taxable year of less than 12 months 

  

there presently are two gross income requirements first at least 75 of our gross income excluding gross income from “prohibited transactions” as defined below for each taxable year must be derived directly or indirectly from investments relating to real property or mortgages on real property or from certain types of temporary investment income second at least 

  

95 of our gross income excluding gross income from prohibited transactions for each taxable year must be derived from income that qualifies under the 75 test and all other dividends interest and gain from the sale or other disposition of stock or securities a “prohibited transaction” is a sale or other disposition of property other than foreclosure property to be sold to customers in the ordinary course of business 

  

at the close of each quarter of our taxable year we must also satisfy four tests relating to the nature of our assets first at least 75 of the value of our total assets must be represented by real estate assets certain stock or debt instruments purchased with the proceeds of a stock offering or long term public debt offering by us but only for the one year period after such offering cash cash items and government securities second not more than 25 of our total assets may be represented by securities other than those in the 75 asset class third of the investments included in the 25 asset class the value of any one issuer’s securities owned by us may not exceed 5 of the value of our total assets and we may not own more than 10 of the vote or value of the securities of a nonreit corporation other than certain debt securities and interests in taxable reit subsidiaries as defined below fourth not more than 20 of the value of our total assets may be represented by securities of one or more taxable reit subsidiaries 

  

we own interests in various partnerships and limited liability companies in the case of a reit that is a partner in a partnership or a member of a limited liability company that is treated as a partnership under the code treasury regulations provide that for purposes of the reit income and asset tests the reit will be deemed to own its proportionate share of the assets of the partnership or limited liability company and will be deemed to be entitled to the income of the partnership or limited liability company attributable to such share the ownership of an interest in a partnership or limited liability company by a reit may involve special tax risks including the challenge by the internal revenue service the “service” of the allocations of income and expense items of the partnership or limited liability company which would affect the computation of taxable income of the reit and the status of the partnership or limited liability company as a partnership as opposed to an association taxable as a corporation for federal income tax purposes we also own interests in a number of subsidiaries which are intended to be treated as qualified reit subsidiaries each a “qrs” the code provides that such subsidiaries will be ignored for federal income tax purposes and all assets liabilities and items of income deduction and credit of such subsidiaries will be treated as assets liabilities and such items of ours if any partnership limited liability company or subsidiary in which we own an interest were treated as a regular corporation and not as a partnership qrs or taxable reit subsidiary for federal income tax purposes we would likely fail to satisfy the reit asset tests described above and would therefore fail to qualify as a reit we believe that each of the partnerships limited liability companies and subsidiaries other than taxable reit subsidiaries in which we own an interest will be treated for tax purposes as a partnership or disregarded entity in the case of a 100 owned partnership or limited liability company or qrs respectively although no assurance can be given that the service will not successfully challenge the status of any such organization 

  

we also own interests in two subsidiaries which are intended to be treated as taxable reit subsidiaries each a “trs” a reit may own any percentage of the voting stock and value of the securities of a corporation which jointly elects with the reit to be a trs provided certain requirements are met a trs generally may engage in any business including the provision of customary or noncustomary services to tenants of its parent reit and of others except a trs may not manage or operate a hotel or health care facility a trs is treated as a regular corporation and is subject to federal income tax and applicable state income and franchise taxes at regular corporate rates in addition a 100 tax may be imposed on a reit if its rental service or other agreements with its trs or the trs’s agreements with the reits tenants are not on arms’ length terms 

  

in order to qualify as a reit we are required to distribute dividends other than capital gain dividends to our stockholders in an amount at least equal to a the sum of i 90 of our “real estate investment trust taxable income” computed without regard to the dividends paid deduction and our net capital gain and ii 90 of the net income if any after tax from foreclosure property minus b the sum of certain items of noncash income such distributions must be paid in the taxable year to which they relate or in the following taxable year if declared before we timely file our tax return for such year if paid on or before the first regular dividend payment date after such declaration and if we so elect and specify the dollar amount in our tax return to the extent that we do not distribute all of our net longterm capital gain or distribute at least 90 but less than 100 of our “real estate investment trust taxable income” as adjusted we will be required to pay tax thereon at regular corporate tax rates furthermore if we should fail to distribute during each calendar year at least the sum of i 85 of our ordinary income for such year ii 95 of our capital gain income for such year and iii any undistributed taxable income from prior periods we would be required to pay a 4 excise tax on the excess of such required distributions over the amounts actually distributed 

  

if we fail to qualify for taxation as a reit in any taxable year and certain relief provisions do not apply we will be required to pay tax including any applicable alternative minimum tax on our taxable income at regular corporate rates distributions to stockholders in any year in which we fail to qualify will not be deductible by us nor will they be required to be made unless entitled to relief under specific statutory provisions we will also be disqualified from taxation as a reit for the four taxable years following the year during which qualification was lost it is not possible to state whether in all circumstances we would be entitled to the statutory relief failure to qualify for even one year could substantially reduce distributions to 

  

stockholders and could result in our incurring substantial indebtedness to the extent borrowings are feasible or liquidating substantial investments in order to pay the resulting taxes 

  

we and our stockholders may be required to pay state or local tax in various state or local jurisdictions including those in which we or they transact business or reside the state and local tax treatment of us and our stockholders may not conform to the federal income tax consequences discussed above 

  

government regulation 

  

the health care industry is heavily regulated by federal state and local laws this government regulation of the health care industry affects us because 

  

   

   

these laws and regulations are subject to frequent and substantial changes resulting from legislation adoption of rules and regulations and administrative and judicial interpretations of existing law these changes may have a dramatic effect on the definition of permissible or impermissible activities the relative costs associated with doing business and the amount of reimbursement by both government and other thirdparty payors these changes may be applied retroactively the ultimate timing or effect of these changes cannot be predicted the failure of any tenant or borrower to comply with such laws regulations and requirements could affect its ability to operate its facility or facilities and could adversely affect such tenant’s or borrower’s ability to make debt or lease payments to us 

  

fraud and abuse laws  there are various federal and state laws prohibiting fraud and abusive business practices by health care providers who participate in receive payments from or are in a position to make referrals in connection with a governmentsponsored health care program including but not limited to the medicare and medicaid programs these include 

  

   

   

   

   

each of these laws include criminal andor civil penalties for violations that range from punitive sanctions damage assessments penalties imprisonment denial of medicare and medicaid payments andor exclusion from the medicare and medicaid programs imposition of any of these types of penalties on our tenants or borrowers could result in a material adverse effect on their operations which could adversely affect our business additionally certain laws such as the false claims act allow for individuals to bring qui tam or whistleblower actions on behalf of the government for violations of fraud and abuse laws some medicare fiscal intermediaries private companies that contract with cms to administer the medicare program have also increased scrutiny of cost reports filed by longterm care providers 

  

many states have adopted or are considering legislative proposals similar to these fraud and abuse laws further under operation restore trust a major antifraud demonstration project the office of inspector general of the us department of health and human services in cooperation with other federal and state agencies has focused on the activities of skilled nursing facilities home health agencies hospices and durable medical equipment suppliers in certain states including california in which we have properties due to the success of operation restore trust the project has been expanded to numerous other states and to additional providers including providers of ancillary nursing home services 

  

in december of 2003 the medicare prescription drug improvement and modernization act of 2003 the “act” was signed into law the act established an 18month moratorium on the “whole hospital exception” to the stark law whereby physicians have been permitted to refer patients for designated health services to hospitals in which they have an ownership interest the moratorium removes specialty hospitals from the “whole hospital exception” specialty hospitals include hospitals primarily or exclusively engaged in the care and treatment of cardiac conditions or orthopedic conditions or hospitals that perform certain surgical procedures specialty hospitals in operation or under development as of november 18 2003 are grandfathered under the moratorium the act requires that medpac an independent federal body established to advise congress on issues affecting the medicare program and hhs conduct studies on the costs of service utilization quality of care and financial impact of specialty hospitals and their physician owners relative to community hospitals particularly nonprofits these studies may result in legislation extending the moratorium or further restricting hospital ownership by physicians 

  

we have no knowledge that would lead us to believe that any of the other facilities in which we have investments are not in substantial compliance with the various regulatory requirements applicable to them although there can be no assurance that the operators are in compliance or will remain in compliance in the future 

  

licensure risks  most health care facilities must obtain a license from the state in which they operate failure to obtain licensure or loss of licensure would prevent a facility from providing health care services on the premises these events could adversely affect the facility operator’s ability to make rent and debt payments state and local laws also may regulate expansion including the addition of new beds or services or acquisition of medical equipment and occasionally the contraction of health care facilities by requiring certificate of need or other similar approval programs 

  

environmental matters  a wide variety of federal state and local environmental and occupational health and safety laws and regulations affect health care facility operations under various federal state and local environmental laws ordinances and regulations an owner of real property or a secured lender such as us may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of hazardous or toxic substances at under or disposed of in connection with such property as well as other potential costs relating to hazardous or toxic substances including government fines and damages for injuries to persons and adjacent property the cost of any required remediation removal fines or personal or property damages and the owner’s or secured lender’s liability therefore could exceed the value of the property andor the assets of the owner or secured lender in addition the presence of such substances or the failure to properly dispose of or remediate such substances may adversely affect the owner’s ability to sell or rent such property or to borrow using such property as collateral which in turn would reduce our revenue 

  

although the mortgage loans that we provide and leases covering our properties require the borrower and the tenant to indemnify us for certain environmental liabilities the scope of such obligations may be limited and we cannot assure that any such borrower or tenant would be able to fulfill its indemnification obligations 

  

the federal medicare and medicaid programs  sources of revenue for tenants and mortgagors may include the federal medicare program state medicaid programs private insurance carriers health care service plans and health maintenance organizations among others efforts to reduce costs by these payors will likely continue which may result in reduced or slower growth in reimbursement for certain services provided by some of our operators in addition the failure of any of our operators to comply with various laws and regulations could jeopardize their certification and their ability to continue to participate in the medicare and medicaid programs 

  

state medicaid programs medicaid programs differ from state to state but they are all subject to federallyimposed requirements at least 50 of the funds available under these programs is provided by the federal government under a matching program medicaid programs generally pay for acute and rehabilitative care based on reasonable costs at fixed rates longterm care facilities are generally reimbursed using fixed daily rates medicaid payments are generally below retail rates for tenantoperated facilities increasingly states have introduced managed care contracting techniques in the administration of medicaid programs such mechanisms could have the impact of reducing utilization of and reimbursement to facilities other third party payors in various states and areas base payments on costs retail rates or increasingly negotiated rates negotiated rates can include discounts from normal charges fixed daily rates and prepaid capitated rates 

  

entrance fee communities  certain of the facilities mortgaged to or owned by us are operated as entrance fee communities generally an entrance fee is an upfront fee or consideration paid by a resident in exchange for some form of longterm benefit some of the entrance fee communities are subject to significant state regulatory oversight including for example oversight of each facility’s financial condition establishment and monitoring of reserve requirements and other financial restrictions the right of residents to cancel their contracts within a specified period of time lien rights in favor of the residents restrictions on change of ownership and similar matters such oversight and the rights of residents within these entrance fee communities may have an effect on the revenue or operations of the operators of such facilities and therefore may adversely impact us 

  

health care facilities the health care facilities in our portfolio including longterm care facilities acute care hospitals assisted living facilities physician group practice clinics and rehabilitation hospitals are subject to extensive federal state and local licensure certification and inspection laws and regulations failure to comply with any of these laws could result in loss of accreditation denial of reimbursement imposition of fines suspension or decertification from federal and state health care programs loss of license or closure of the facility such actions may have an effect on the revenue of the operators of properties owned by or mortgaged to us and therefore adversely impact us 

  

senate bill 1953 california hospitals are subject to state senate bill 1953 sb 1953 which requires certain seismic safety building standards for acute care hospital facilities a hospital located in tarzana california and leased by tenet is affected by sb 1953 as a result we and tenet are evaluating the effects of compliance with sb 1953 including the costs of remediation time for completion structural and financial feasibility of repairs we cannot currently estimate the potential costs of sb 1953 compliance on this hospital or the final allocation of costs with respect to us and our tenants 

  

nursestaffing ratios  on january 1 2004 a california law became effective mandating specific minimum nurse staffing ratios for acute care hospitals as a result of this requirement hospital labor costs will be materially increased facilities may also be forced to limit patient admissions due to an inability to hire the necessary number of nurses to meet the required ratio which affects net operating revenue it is unclear the extent to which compliance with these nurse staffing ratios in california may adversely affect hospital operators in california 

  

health care reform 

  

the health care industry continues to face various challenges including increased government and private payor pressure on health care providers to control costs the migration of patients from acute care facilities into extended care and home care settings and the vertical and horizontal consolidation of health care providers 

  

changes in the law new interpretations of existing laws and changes in payment methodologies may have a dramatic effect on the definition of permissible or impermissible activities the relative costs associated with doing business and the amount of reimbursement furnished by both government and other thirdparty payors these changes may be applied retroactively under certain circumstances the ultimate timing or effect of legislative efforts cannot be predicted and may impact us in different ways 

  

the medicare prescription drug improvement and modernization act of 2003 the “act” was signed into law on december 8 2003 the law provides among other things prescription drug benefits for the elderly and individuals with disabilities through subsidies and discounts and establishes drug payment methodologies and drug reimportation requirements as discussed above the act affects the “whole hospital exception” to the stark law the act also makes significant changes to payment provisions under medicare parts a and b and medicaid hospitals may experience an increase in revenue due to expanded opportunities for wage index reclassifications expanded coverage of device trials reduction in thresholds to qualify for the new technology addon payment inpatient prospective payment systems updates and other provisions critical access hospitals rural referral centers lowvolume hospitals and disproportionate share hospitals in particular will receive increased payments and adjustments under the act however certain outpatient drug reimbursements to hospitals may be reduced we cannot predict how our operators will fare under the act until implementing regulations are issued to provide further guidance interim final regulations for certain provisions became effective on january 1 2004 and the center for medicare and medicaid services set implementation dates for many provisions in 2004 

  

in addition to the reforms enacted and considered by congress from time to time state legislatures periodically consider various health care reform proposals congress and state legislatures can be expected to continue to review and assess alternative health care delivery systems new regulatory enforcement initiatives and new payment methodologies 

  

we believe that government and private efforts to contain or reduce health care costs will continue these trends are likely to lead to reduced or slower growth in reimbursement for certain services provided by some of our tenants and mortgagors we believe that the vast nature of the health care industry the financial strength and operating flexibility of our operators and the diversity of our portfolio will mitigate the impact of any such diminution in reimbursements however we cannot predict what legislation will be adopted and no assurance can be given that the health care reforms will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 

  

legal entities 

  

we conduct our business through various legal entities including the following at december 31 2003 

  

   

  

  

  

risk factors 

  

you should carefully consider the risks described below as well as the risks described in “government regulation” and “health care reform” and elsewhere in this report before making an investment decision in our company the risks and uncertainties described herein are not the only ones facing us and there may be additional risks that we do not presently know of or that we currently consider not likely to have a significant impact all of these risks could adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

  

if our tenants and mortgagors are unable to operate our properties in a manner sufficient to generate income they may be unable to make rent and loan payments to us 

  

the health care industry is highly competitive and we expect that it may become more competitive in the future our tenants and mortgagors are subject to competition from other health care providers that provide similar health care services which competition has been intensified due to overbuilding in some segments in which we operate causing a slowdown in the fillrate of newly constructed buildings and a reduction in the monthly rate many newly built and previously existing facilities were able to obtain for their services the profitability of health care facilities depends upon several factors including the number of physicians using the health care facilities or referring patients there competitive systems of health care delivery and the size and composition of the population in the surrounding area private federal and state payment programs and the effect of other laws and regulations may also have a significant influence on the revenues and income of the properties if our tenants and mortgagors are not competitive with other health care providers and are unable to generate income they may be unable to make rent and loan payments to us 

  

decline in the assisted living sector may have significant adverse consequences to us 

  

the assisted living industry has been challenged by overbuilding slow fillup rates rising insurance costs and higher operating costs associated with increased acuity of residents these challenges have had and are expected to continue to have an adverse effect on our assisted living facilities and facility operators 

  

decline in the longterm care sector may have significant adverse consequences to us 

  

certain of our longterm care operators and facilities continue to experience operating problems in part due to a national nursing shortage increased liability insurance costs and low levels of medicaid reimbursement in certain states due to economic challenges facing many states nursing homes will likely continue to be underfunded some states such as california have proposed to reduce medicaid reimbursement to nursing home providers these challenges have had and are expected to continue to have an adverse effect on our longterm care facilities and facility operators 

  

if we are unable to purchase suitable health care facilities at a favorable cost of capital we will be unable to continue to grow 

  

the acquisition and financing of health care facilities at favorable costs is highly competitive as a result of reits being required to make dividend distributions and thus retain little capital for growth we can only grow through the steady investment of new capital into real estate assets if we cannot identify and purchase a sufficient quantity of health care facilities at favorable prices or if we are unable to finance such acquisitions on commercially favorable terms our business will suffer 

  

unforeseen costs associated with the acquisition of new properties could reduce our profitability 

  

our business strategy contemplates future acquisitions the acquisitions we make may not prove to be successful we might encounter unanticipated difficulties and expenditures relating to any acquired properties including contingent liabilities further newly acquired properties might require significant management attention that would otherwise be devoted to our ongoing business we might never realize the anticipated benefits of an acquisition which could adversely affect our profitability 

  

the bankruptcy insolvency or financial deterioration of our facility operators could significantly delay our ability to collect unpaid rents or require us to find new operators 

  

our financial position and our ability to make distributions to our stockholders may be adversely affected by financial difficulties experienced by any of our major operators including bankruptcy insolvency or a general downturn in the business or in the event any of our major operators do not renew or extend their relationship with us as their lease terms expire 

  

we are exposed to the risk that our operators may not be able to meet their obligations which may result in their bankruptcy or insolvency although our leases and loans provide us the right to terminate an investment evict an operator demand immediate repayment and other remedies the bankruptcy laws afford certain rights to a party that has filed for bankruptcy or reorganization an operator in bankruptcy may be able to restrict our ability to collect unpaid rents or interest during the bankruptcy proceeding 

  

tenet healthcare corporation accounts for 16 of our revenues less operating expenses and is currently under investigation by several governmental entities 

  

during 2003 tenet healthcare corporation accounted for 16 of our revenues less operating expenses according to public disclosures by tenet tenet is undergoing an investigation by the securities and exchange commission relating to its billing practices and financial disclosures the united states department of justice is suing tenet over medicare fraud allegations the us attorney’s office is investigating tenet’s use of physician relocation agreements certain contractual matters related to physicians and others and medicare outlier payments a federal grand jury has returned an indictment accusing a subsidiary of tenet of illegal use of physician relocation agreements the internal revenue service has assessed a 157 million tax deficiency with interest of 118 million as of september 30 2003 against tenet the united states senate finance committee is investigating tenet’s corporate governance practices with respect to federal health care programs tenet is litigating several federal securities class action and shareholder derivative suits and several state law actions tenet is litigating a qui tam action in florida regarding alleged illegal kickbacks the united states department of health and human services is investigating tenet’s relationship with the women’s cancer center a former executive of tenet received a 148 million judgment against tenet for certain stock incentive awards and tenet is subject to other federal and state investigations regarding its business practices tenet is responding to a justice department subpoena regarding the outlier payments at the company’s tarzana facility 

  

on march 9 2004 tenet announced that it amended its bank credit agreement which reduced the aggregate commitments available under the revolving credit facility including funded loans and letters of credit from 1200000000 to 800000000 with a limit on funded loans of 500000000 and letters of credit of 300000000 tenet also announced that currently there are no funded loans and 215000000 of letters of credit are outstanding 

  

we cannot predict the impact if any that these recent developments may have on individual hospital performances and the related lease payments due to us by tenet the failure or inability of tenet to pay its obligations to us could materially reduce our revenue and net income which could in turn reduce the amount of dividends we pay to our stockholders and cause our stock price to decline 

  

loss of our tax status as a real estate investment trust would have significant adverse consequences to us 

  

we currently operate and have operated commencing with our taxable year ended december 31 1985 in a manner that is intended to allow us to qualify as a real estate investment trust for federal income tax purposes under the internal revenue code of 1986 as amended 

  

qualification as a real estate investment trust involves the application of highly technical and complex internal revenue code provisions for which there are only limited judicial and administrative interpretations the determination of various factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control may affect our ability to qualify as a real estate investment trust for example in order to qualify as a real estate investment trust at least 95 of our gross income in any year must be derived from qualifying sources and we must satisfy a number of requirements regarding the composition of our assets also we must make distributions to stockholders aggregating annually at least 90 of our real estate investment trust taxable income excluding capital gains in addition new legislation regulations administrative interpretations or court decisions may adversely affect our investors or our ability to qualify as a real estate investment trust for tax purposes although we believe that we have been organized and have operated in such manner we can give no assurance that we have qualified or will continue to qualify as a reit for tax purposes 

  

if we lose our real estate investment trust status we will face serious tax consequences that will substantially reduce the funds available to make payments of principal and interest on the debt securities we issue and to make distributions to our stockholders if we fail to qualify as a real estate investment trust 

  

   

   

   

in addition if we fail to qualify as a real estate investment trust all distributions to stockholders would be subject to tax as regular corporate dividends to the extent of our current and accumulated earnings and profits and we would not be required to make distributions to stockholders 

  

as a result of all these factors our failure to qualify as a real estate investment trust also could impair our ability to expand our business and raise capital and could adversely affect the market value of our securities 

  

tax law changes may adversely affect our stock price 

  

the federal income tax laws governing reits and other corporations or the administrative interpretations of those laws may be amended at any time any new laws or interpretations may take effect retroactively and could adversely affect our stock price the current maximum tax rate for noncorporate taxpayers for certain “qualified” dividends has generally been reduced from 386 to 15 for taxable years beginning after december 31 2002 in general dividends payable by reits are not eligible for the reduced tax rate on corporate dividends except to the extent the reit’s dividends are attributable to dividends received from taxable corporations such as our taxable reit subsidiaries to income that was subject to tax at the corporatereit level or to dividends properly designated by us as “capital gain dividends” although these tax rate changes do not adversely affect the taxation of reits or dividends paid by reits the more favorable treatment of regular corporate dividends could cause investors who are individuals to consider stock of other corporations that pay dividends to be more attractive relative to stock of reits which may adversely effect our stock price and our ability to raise additional capital 

  

our operators are faced with increased litigation and rising insurance costs that may affect their ability to pay their lease or mortgage payments 

  

in some states advocacy groups have been created to monitor the quality of care at health care facilities and these groups have brought litigation against operators also in several instances private litigation by patients has succeeded in winning very large damage awards for alleged abuses the effect of this litigation and potential litigation has been to materially increase the costs of monitoring and reporting quality of care compliance incurred by our tenants in addition the cost of liability and medical malpractice insurance has increased and may continue to increase so long as the present litigation environment affecting the operations of health care facilities continues continued cost increases could cause our tenants to be unable to pay their lease or mortgage payments potentially decreasing our revenue and increasing our collection and litigation costs moreover to the extent we are required to take back the affected facilities our revenue from those facilities could be reduced or eliminated for an extended period of time 

  

we rely on external sources of capital to fund future capital needs and if our access to such capital is difficult or on commercially unreasonable terms we may not be able to meet maturing commitments or make future investments necessary to grow our business 

  

in order to qualify as a reit under the internal revenue code we are required among other things each year to distribute to our stockholders at least 90 of our reit taxable income because of this distribution requirement we may not be able to fund all future capital needs including capital needs in connection with acquisitions from cash retained from operations as a result we rely on external sources of capital if we are unable to obtain needed capital at all or only on unfavorable terms from these sources we might not be able to make the investments needed to grow our business or to meet our obligations and commitments as they mature which could negatively affect the ratings of our debt and even in extreme circumstances affect our ability to continue operations our access to capital depends upon a number of factors over which we have little or no control including general market conditions and the market’s perception of our growth potential and our current and potential future earnings and cash distributions and the market price of the shares of our capital stock 

  

since real estate investments are illiquid we may not be able to sell properties when we desire 

  

real estate investments generally cannot be sold quickly we may not be able to vary our portfolio promptly in response to vacancies or economic conditions this inability to respond to changes in the performance of our investments could adversely affect our ability to service debt and make distributions to our stockholders in addition there are limitations under the federal income tax laws applicable to reits that may limit our ability to recognize the full economic benefit from a sale of our assets 

  

transfers of health care facilities generally require regulatory approvals and alternative uses of health care facilities are limited 

  

because transfers of health care facilities may be subject to regulatory approvals not required for transfers of other types of commercial operations and other types of real estate there may be delays in transferring operations of our facilities to successor tenants or we may be prohibited from transferring operations to a successor tenant in addition substantially all of our properties are health care facilities that may not be easily adapted to nonhealth care related uses if we are unable to transfer properties at times opportune to us our revenue and operations may suffer 

  

some potential losses may not be covered by insurance 

  

we require our tenants and mortgagors to secure and maintain comprehensive liability and property insurance that covers us as well as the tenants or mortgagors on all of our properties some types of losses however either may be uninsurable or too expensive to insure against should an uninsured loss or a loss in excess of insured limits occur we could lose all or a portion of the capital we have invested in a property as well as the anticipated future revenue from the property in such an event we might nevertheless remain obligated for any mortgage debt or other financial obligations related to the property we cannot assure you that material losses in excess of insurance proceeds will not occur in the future

general 

  

health care property investors inc including its whollyowned subsidiaries and affiliated joint ventures hcp generally acquires health care facilities and leases them on a longterm basis to health care providers we also lease medical office space to providers and physicians on a shorter term basis in addition we provide mortgage financing on health care facilities 

  

as of december 31 2003 our portfolio of properties including those invested in through joint ventures and mortgage loans consisted of 554 facilities located in 44 states these facilities are comprised of 31 hospitals 173 longterm care facilities 124 assisted living and retirement living facilities 196 medical office buildings and 30 other health care facilities our investment in these properties which represents the historical cost of our real estate investments and the net book value of our unconsolidated joint ventures and secured loans receivable was approximately 34 billion at december 31 2003 

  

significant accounting policies and estimates 

  

the following are our significant accounting policies and estimates 

  

revenue recognition 

  

rental revenue from our tenants is our principal source of revenue we recognize revenue in accordance with sec staff accounting bulletin no 101 revenue recognition in financial statements sab 101 as amended we recognize base rental income on a straightline basis over the term of the related lease when collectibility is deemed probable additional rental income based on a percentage of a tenant’s increased revenue over a specified base period revenue is deferred until the annual rather than quarterly base period revenue is exceeded if we overestimate the collectibility of rental and other income our financial condition and results of operations could be significantly affected 

  

allowance for doubtful accounts 

  

we monitor the liquidity and creditworthiness of our tenants on an ongoing basis based on these reviews we have established provisions and maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the possible inability of our tenants to make required rent payments an allowance for doubtful accounts is recorded as required as a charge to operations in our consolidated statements of operations the total amount of the allowance for doubtful accounts which represents the cumulative provisions less writeoffs of uncollectible rent is recorded against tenant and other receivables on our consolidated balance sheets if we underestimate the required allowances for doubtful accounts our financial condition and results of operations could be significantly affected 

  

real estate investments 

  

we record the acquisition of real estate at cost and allocate the cost of the acquisition to the acquired tangible assets and intangible assets that arise from contractual or other legal rights including inplace leases based on their respective fair values the fair value for land and buildings is typically based on appraised value and replacement cost as if vacant respectively the fair value of inplace leases is determined based on the present value of above or below market rents tenant origination costs and the net lease income from inplace leases over a reasonable leaseup period 

  

we compute depreciation on our properties using the straightline method based on an estimated useful life ranging up to 45 years we compute depreciation on equipment tenant improvements and lease costs using the straightline method and an estimated useful life ranging up to 10 years or the lease term whichever is appropriate if the allocation to building or estimates of useful life of our properties changes depreciation and amortization expense may change which may impact our results of operations 

  

investments in joint ventures 

  

we have adopted interpretation no 46 “consolidation of variable interest entities on interpretation of accounting research bulletin no 51” fin 46 for variable interest entities created after january 31 2003 and consolidate variable interest entities in which we absorb a majority of the entity’s expected losses receive a majority of the entity’s expected residual returns or both as a result of ownership contractual or other financial interests in the entity for entities that do not qualify as variable interest entities we consolidate those entities that are majority owned and controlled 

  

since we have not adopted fin 46 for variable interest entities created before february 1 2003 we continue to consolidate the accounts of all majority owned and controlled subsidiaries and certain general and limited partnerships created prior to that date for investments in certain general partnerships and joint ventures created before february 1 2003 in which we may serve as the general partner or managing member where the other members in these joint ventures have significant voting rights relative to acquisition sale and refinancing of assets as well as approval rights with respect to budgets we continue to account for these investments using the equity method of accounting the accounting policies of these joint ventures are substantially consistent with ours we are currently evaluating the effects on us if any of the adoption of fin 46 for variable interest entities created before february 1 2003 

  

impairment of longlived assets 

  

we periodically review longlived assets primarily real estate investments in unconsolidated joint ventures and notes receivable for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable the recoverability and determination of the fair value of longlived assets involves significant judgment and is based on an analysis of the future operating results or projected rents for each longlived asset properties to be sold are recorded at the lower of cost or expected sales price less costs to sell our ability to accurately predict future cash flows may impact the determination of fair value which may significantly impact our results of operations 

  

discontinued operations 

  

we have reclassified certain facilities’ operations as discontinued operations in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 144 “accounting for the impairment or disposal of longlived assets” statement 144 which was issued in august 2001 statement 144 established accounting and reporting standards requiring that longlived assets to be disposed of be reported as discontinued operations if management has committed to a plan to sell the asset under usual and customary terms within one year of establishing the plan to sell 

  

stock options 

  

on january 1 2002 we adopted the fair value method of accounting for stockbased compensation in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 123 “accounting for stock based compensation” statement 123 as amended by statement of financial accounting standards no 148 “accounting for stock based compensation” we adopted the fair value provisions of statement 123 prospectively so that the fair value of all stock options granted on or after january 1 2002 is recognized as compensation expense since only new grants are accounted for under the fair value method stock based compensation expense is less than which would have been recognized if the fair value method had been applied to all awards our 2001 operating results were not impacted by the adoption of the fair value method we use the black scholes model for calculating the fair value of option grants which requires us to make certain estimates including the expected stock volatility risk free interest rate dividend yield and the term of the option changes in our estimates could significantly impact our results of operations 

  

stock split 

  

on january 22 2004 we announced a 2for1 stock split in the form of a stock dividend for each outstanding share of common stock on february 4 2004 the stock split has been reflected in all periods presented

interest expense for the year ended december 31 2003 increased 172 or 13331000 to 90749000 the increase is primarily due to the issuance of 200000000 in aggregate principal amount of 6 longterm debt in february 2003 and 250000000 of 645 longterm debt in june 2002 our investments are primarily financed with fixed rate debt changes in interest rates will not have a significant impact to interest expense until our debt matures and must be financed real estate depreciation from continuing operations increased 77 or 5640000 to 79095000 for the year ended december 31 2003 as a result of acquisitions in 2003 and 2002 general and administrative expenses for the year ended december 31 2003 increased 320 or 5998000 to 24731000 the increase is primarily the result of costs related to vacant properties an increase in troubled properties temporary duplicate asset management functions resulting from the acquisition and transition of medcap properties llc and increased compensation costs

liquidity and capital resources 

  

cash flows from operating activities represent the primary source of liquidity to fund distributions in order to qualify as a reit for federal income tax purposes we must distribute at least 90 of our taxable income to our shareholders accordingly we intend to continue to make regular quarterly distributions to holders of our common and preferred stock during 2003 we issued dividends totaling 206166000 and 18183000 to holders of our common and preferred stock respectively we believe that our liquidity and sources of capital are adequate to finance our operations for the foreseeable future 

  

our cash flows from operations are dependent upon the occupancy level of multitenant buildings and the rental rates on our leases material changes in either of these factors could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend   

our investments are financed by the sale of common and preferred stock longterm and mediumterm debt internally generated cash flows and some shortterm bank debt 

  

we generally have fixed base rent on our leases in addition there can be additional rent based on a percentage of increased revenue over specified base period revenue of the properties andor increases based on inflation indices or other factors financing costs are comprised of dividends on common and preferred stock interest on longterm and mediumterm debt and shortterm interest on bank debt 

  

on a more limited basis we have provided mortgage loans to operators of health care facilities in the normal course of business all of the mortgage loans receivable have fixed interest rates or interest rates with periodic fixed increases therefore the mortgage loans receivable are all considered to be fixed rate loans and the current interest rate the lowest rate is used in the computation of market risk provided in the following table if material 

  

we may assume existing mortgage notes payable as part of an acquisition transaction currently we have two mortgage notes payable with variable interest rates and the remaining mortgage notes payable have fixed interest rates or interest rates with fixed periodic increases our senior notes are at fixed rates with one exception for a 25000000 variable rate senior note for which management has fixed the interest rate by means of a swap contract the variable rate loans are at interest rates below the current prime rate of 400 and fluctuations are tied to the prime rate or to a rate currently below the prime rate 

  

at december 31 2003 we are exposed to market risks related to fluctuations in interest rates on 4075000 of variable rate mortgage notes payable and 198000000 of variable rate bank debt on our total investment in our properties of 34 billion 

  

fluctuation in the interest rate environment will not affect our future earnings and cash flows on our fixed rate debt until that debt matures and must be replaced or refinanced interest rate changes will affect the fair value of the fixed rate instruments conversely changes in interest rates on variable rate debt would change our future earnings and cash flows but not affect the fair value on those instruments assuming a one percentage point increase in the interest rate related to the variable rate debt including the mortgage notes payable and the bank lines of credit and assuming no change in the outstanding balance as of year end interest expense for 2003 would increase by approximately 2021000 or 002 per common share on a diluted basis 

  

the principal amount and the average interest rates for the mortgage loans receivable and debt categorized by the final maturity dates is presented in the following table the fair value estimates for the mortgage loans receivable are based on the estimates of management and on rates currently prevailing for comparable loans the fair market value estimates for debt securities are based on discounting future cash flows utilizing current rates offered to us for debt of the same type and remaining maturity

in january 2003 the financial accounting standards board fasb issued interpretation no 46 “consolidation of variable interest entities an interpretation of accounting research bulletin no 51” interpretation no 46 effective immediately for all variable interest entities created after january 31 2003 and for the first fiscal year or interim period beginning after june 15 2003 for variable interest entities in which an enterprise holds a variable interest that is acquired before february 1 2003 during october 2003 and again in december 2003 the fasb met and agreed to defer the effective date of interpretation no 46 for variable interests acquired before february 1 2003 the deferral will require public companies to adopt the provisions of interpretation no 46 for such variable interests in periods ending after march 15 2004 that is the quarter ending march 31 2004 for the company 

  

we have adopted interpretation no 46 for variable interest entities created after january 31 2003 interpretation no 46 requires the consolidation of variable interest entities in which an enterprise absorbs a majority of the entity’s expected losses receives a majority of the entity’s expected residual returns or both as a result of ownership contractual or other financial interests in the entity for entities that do not qualify as variable interest entities we consolidate those entities that are majority owned and controlled 

  

since we have not adopted interpretation no 46 for variable interest entities created before february 1 2003 we continue to consolidate the accounts of all majority owned and controlled subsidiaries and certain general and limited partnerships created prior to that date for investments in certain general partnerships and joint ventures created before february 1 2003 in which we may serve as the general partner or managing member where the other members in these joint ventures have significant voting rights relative to acquisition sale and refinancing of assets as well as approval rights with respect to budgets we continue to account for these investments using the equity method of accounting the accounting policies of these joint ventures are substantially consistent with ours we are currently evaluating the effects on us if any of the adoption of interpretation no 46 for variable interest entities created before february 1 2003 

  

in may 2003 the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 150 “accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity” statement 150 statement 150 requires that mandatorily redeemable financial instruments be classified as a liability and recorded at settlement value as of the balance sheet date as a result consolidated partnerships with a limitedlife are considered mandatorily redeemable on october 29 2003 the fasb met and voted to defer implementation of the provisions of statement 150 that require the valuation and establishment of a liability for limitedlife entities statement 150 would have applied to seven limitedlife partnerships effective october 2003 we amended the agreement for one of these partnerships to remove the limitedlife provision the minority interest in this partnership is not mandatorily redeemable and is not subject to the disclosure provisions of statement 150 as of december 31 2003 we have estimated the settlement value of the minority interests in the remaining six partnerships to be approximately 4500000 which is approximately 2500000 more than the carrying amount of such minority interests

    we calculate the net operating income of our managed properties by subtracting from contractual rent the anticipated expenses not covered by the tenant under the gross leases underlying such properties see “leases and loans” below 

  

      

property types 

  

the following paragraphs describe each type of property 

  

longterm care facilities  we have invested in 184 longterm care facilities various health care providers operate these facilities longterm care facilities offer restorative rehabilitative and custodial nursing care for people not requiring the more extensive and sophisticated treatment available at acute care hospitals ancillary revenues and revenue from subacute care services are derived from providing services to residents beyond room and board and include occupational physical speech respiratory and iv therapy wound care oncology treatment brain injury care and orthopedic therapy as well as sales of pharmaceutical products and other services certain longterm care facilities provide some of the foregoing services on an outpatient basis longterm care facilities are designed to supplement hospital care and many have transfer agreements with one or more acute care hospitals these facilities depend to some degree upon referrals from practicing physicians and hospitals longterm care services are paid for either by private sources or through the federal medicare and state medicaid programs 

  

longterm care facilities generally provide patients with accommodation complete medical and nursing care and rehabilitation services including speech physical and occupational therapy as a part of the omnibus budget reconciliation act obra of 1981 congress established a waiver program under medicaid to offer an alternative to institutional longterm care services the provisions of obra and the subsequent obra acts of 1987 and 1990 allow states with federal approval greater flexibility in program design as a means of developing costeffective alternatives to delivering services traditionally provided in the longterm care setting this was a contributing factor to the past increase in the number of assisted living facilities which adversely affected some longterm care 

  

facilities as some individuals chose the residential environment and lower cost delivery system provided in the assisted living setting 

  

acute care hospitals  we have an interest in 19 general acute care hospitals and three longterm acute care hospitals acute care hospitals offer a wide range of services such as fullyequipped operating and recovery rooms obstetrics radiology intensive care open heart surgery and coronary care neurosurgery neonatal intensive care magnetic resonance imaging nursing units oncology clinical laboratories respiratory therapy physical therapy nuclear medicine rehabilitation services and outpatient services 

  

longterm acute care hospitals provide care for patients with complex medical conditions that require more intensive care monitoring or emergency backup than that available in most skilled nursingbased subacute programs most longterm acute care hospital patients have severe chronic health problems and are medically unstable or at risk of medical instability the most common cases treated in this setting include high acuity ventilatordependent patients and patients with multiple system failures relating to cancer spinal cord injuries or head injuries 

  

services are paid for by private sources third party payors eg insurance and hmos or through the federal medicare and state medicaid programs medicare provides reimbursement incentives to traditional general acute care hospitals to minimize inpatient length of stay 

  

medical office buildings  we have investments in 90 medical office buildings including five health and wellness centers many of these buildings are located adjacent to or on the campus of acute care hospitals medical office buildings contain physicians’ offices and examination rooms and may also include pharmacies hospital ancillary service space and daysurgery operating rooms health and wellness centers provide testing and preventative health maintenance services medical office buildings require more extensive plumbing electrical heating and cooling capabilities than commercial office buildings for sinks brighter lights special equipment and biological waste mechanisms required for the proper operation of a medical office of our owned medical office buildings and health and wellness centers 23 are master leased on a triple net basis while 67 are managed by third party property management companies and are leased under triple net gross or modified gross leases under which we are responsible for certain operating expenses 

  

assisted living facilities  we have investments in 101 assisted living facilities offering studio one bedroom and two bedroom apartments on a monthtomonth basis primarily to individuals who are over 75 years of age with various levels of assistance requirements more ambulatory residents are provided meals and eat in a central dining area they may also be assisted with some daily living activities with programs and services that allow residents certain conveniences and make it possible for them to live independently staff is also available when residents need assistance and for group activities services provided to residents who require more assistance with daily living activities but who do not require the constant supervision other longterm care facilities provide include personal supervision and assistance with eating bathing grooming and administering medication charges for room and board are generally paid from private sources 

  

retirement living communities  we have investments in 14 retirement living communities these communities are large upscale residential communities in a congregate care and continuing care living setting combined with onsite amenities and services residents are provided the comfort security and convenience of residing within an aging in place environment eliminating the need to seek 

  

further resident appropriate levels of care ancillary and health care services are available at those properties that provide nursing and assisted living care the full continuum of senior living environment includes independent living apartments and cottages assisted living and in some communities skilled nursing and alzheimer’s care various accommodation terms are available to residents including monthly rentals rental life care fully refundable entrance fees nonrefundable endowments cooperatives and condominiums 

  

rehabilitation hospitals  we have investments in nine rehabilitation hospitals these hospitals provide inpatient and outpatient care for patients who have sustained traumatic injuries or illnesses such as spinal cord injuries strokes head injuries orthopedic problems work related disabilities and neurological diseases as well as treatment for amputees and patients with severe arthritis rehabilitation programs encompass physical occupational speech and inhalation therapies rehabilitative nursing and other specialties services are paid for by the patient or the patient’s family third party payors eg insurance and hmos or through the federal medicare program 

  

physician group practice clinics  we have investments in 35 physician group practice clinic facilities that are leased to 13 different tenants these clinics generally provide a broad range of medical services through organized physician groups representing various medical specialties each clinic facility is generally leased to a single lessee under a triple net or modified gross lease 

  

health care laboratory and biotech research facilities  we have investments in eight health care laboratory and biotech research facilities these facilities are located on a research campus of a major university the facilities are designed for and accommodate research and development in the biopharmaceutical industry drug discovery and development and predictive and personalized medicine the facilities are leased to two tenants on a longterm basis

    we calculate the net operating income of our managed properties by subtracting from contractual rent the anticipated expenses not covered by the tenant under the gross leases underlying such properties see “leases and loans” below 

  

         

competition 

  

we compete for real estate acquisitions and financings with health care providers other health care related real estate investment trusts real estate partnerships real estate lenders and other investors 

  

our properties are subject to competition from the properties of other health care providers certain of these other operators have capital resources substantially in excess of some of the operators of our facilities in addition the extent to which the properties are utilized depends upon several factors including the number of physicians using the health care facilities or referring patients there competitive systems of health care delivery and the size and composition of the population in the surrounding area private federal and state payment programs and the effect of other laws and regulations may also have a significant influence on the utilization of the properties virtually all of the properties operate in a competitive environment and patients and referral sources including physicians may change their preferences for a health care facility from time to time 

  

  

facility operators 

  

at december 31 2002 we had investments in 463 properties located in 43 states and operated by 96 health care operators in addition approximately 650 leases are in force in the multitenant buildings listed below are our major operators the number of facilities operated by those operators and the annualized revenue and the approximate percentage of annualized revenue derived from those operators

longterm care and assisted living operators 

  

longterm care 

  

approximately 25 of our annualized revenue is currently derived from the longterm care sector reduced reimbursements a nursing shortage and increased liability insurance costs continue to plague the industry certain temporary medicare addon payments enacted in the balanced budget refinement act of 1999 and the medicare medicaid and schip benefit and protection act of 2000 expired in october 2002 as a result medicare reimbursement to nursing homes declined about 9 as of october 1 2002 other add on payments associated with certain classifications are scheduled to expire october 1 2003 but there is currently a proposal to defer these cuts until 2005 a planned limitation on patient medicare rehabilitation therapy procedures scheduled for january 1 2003 has been delayed until july 2003 it is anticipated that medicare reimbursement will be further reduced by the therapy cap the medicare reimbursement decrease effective october 1 2002 but not including future possible reductions is expected to cause the cash flow coverage of rents after management fees of our longterm care facilities on a pro forma basis in the aggregate to decline from 14 to 12 

  

due to economic challenges facing many states nursing homes will likely continue to be under funded some states such as california have proposed to reduce medicaid reimbursement to nursing home providers management believes that inadequate medicare and medicaid reimbursements and other issues discussed above will cause losses and reduced financial performance for many longterm care facilities and operators 

  

we cannot assure you that the troubled operations and bankruptcies of certain longterm care operators will not have a material adverse effect on our net income funds from operations ffo or the market value of our common stock 

  

assisted living operators 

  

we currently derive approximately 14 of our annualized revenue from the assisted living industry this sector has been challenged by overbuilding slow fillup rising insurance costs and higher operating costs associated with increased acuity of residents occupancy rates and bottom line performance including cash flow coverage on rents are improving various operators have continued to expand their portfolios through acquisitions of existing assisted living facilities during this past year and facility new construction continues to remain relatively low indicating a positive signal for the industry more operators are reporting positive operating cash flows for their portfolios while others are approaching this milestone 

  

while improvements are noted for the industry and specific operators we cannot assure you that the trouble experienced by assisted living operators will not have a material adverse effect on our net income funds from operations ffo or the market value of our common stock 

  

leases and loans 

  

the initial base rental rates of the triple net leases of properties we acquired during the three years ended december 31 2002 have generally ranged from 10 to 13 per annum of the acquisition price of the related property initial interest rates on the loans we entered into during the three years ended december 31 2002 have generally ranged from 8 to 14 per annum rental rates vary by lease taking into consideration many factors such as 

  

  

      

certain leases provide for additional rents that are based upon a percentage of increased revenue over specific base period revenue of the leased properties others have rent increases based on inflation indices or other factors and some leases and loans have annual fixed rent or interest rate increases see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements 

  

in addition to the minimum and additional rents each lessee under a triple net lease is responsible for all additional charges including charges related to nonpayment or late payment of rent taxes and assessments governmental charges and utility and other charges each triple net lessee is required at its expense to maintain its leased property in good order and repair we are not required to repair rebuild or maintain the properties leased under triple net leases 

  

each lessee with a gross or modified gross lease is also responsible for minimum and additional rents but may not be responsible for all operating expenses under gross or modified gross leases we may be responsible for property taxes repairs and maintenance andor insurance on those properties 

  

the primary or fixed terms of the triple net and modified gross leases generally range from ten to 15 years and generally have one or more fiveyear or longer renewal options the weighted average remaining base leaseterm on the triple net and modified gross leases is approximately seven years the primary term of the gross leases to multiple tenants in the medical office buildings range from one to 20 years with a weighted average of six years remaining on those leases obligations under the triplenet leases in most cases have corporate parent or shareholder guarantees irrevocable letters of credit from various financial institutions and lease deposits back 141 leases and mortgage loans on 15 facilities which generally cover from one to 12 months of lease or loan payments we require the lessees and mortgagors to renew such letters of credit during the lease or loan term in amounts that may change based upon the passage of time improved operating cash flows or improved credit ratings 

  

based upon information provided to us by lessees or mortgagors certain facilities are presently underperforming financially individual facilities may underperform as a result of inadequate medicaid reimbursement low occupancy less than optimal patient mix excessive operating costs other operational issues or capital needs 

  

each lessee at its expense may make noncapital additions modifications or improvements to its leased property all such alterations replacements and improvements must comply with the terms and provisions of the lease and become our property upon termination of the lease leases generally require the lessee to maintain adequate insurance on the leased property naming us and any 

  

mortgagees as additional insureds in certain circumstances the lessee may selfinsure pursuant to a prudent program of selfinsurance if the lessee or the guarantor of its lease obligations has substantial net worth in addition each lease requires the lessee to indemnify us or our affiliates against certain liabilities in connection with the leased property 

  

development of facilities 

  

since 1987 we have committed to the development of 64 facilities as of december 31 2002 we have funded costs of approximately 447 million and have completed 61 facilities of our total development commitment the completed facilities comprise 

  

        

simultaneously with the commencement of each of these development programs and prior to funding we enter into a lease agreement with the developeroperator the base rent under the lease is generally established at a rate equivalent to a specified margin over our cost of money at the commencement of the lease 

  

our build to suit development program generally includes a variety of additional forms of credit enhancement and collateral beyond those provided by the leases during the development period we generally require additional security and collateral in the form of more than one of the following 

  

     

in addition before we advance any funds under the development agreement the developeroperator must provide 

  

      

  

as a further safeguard during the development period we generally will retain 10 of construction funds incurred until we have received satisfactory evidence that the project will be fully completed in accordance with the applicable plans and specifications we also monitor the progress of the development of each project and the accuracy of the developeroperator’s draw requests by having our own inhouse inspector perform regular onsite inspections of the project prior to the release of any requested funds 

  

investments in consolidated and nonconsolidated joint ventures 

  

consolidated joint ventures 

  

at december 31 2002 we also had varying percentage interests in several limited liability companies and partnerships that together own 84 facilities and one mortgage as further discussed below 

  

       

nonconsolidated joint ventures 

  

     

future acquisitions 

  

we anticipate acquiring additional health care related facilities and leasing them to health care operators or investing in mortgages secured by health care facilities 

  

taxation of hcpi 

  

we believe that we have operated in such a manner as to qualify for taxation as a reit under sections 856 to 860 of the internal revenue code of 1986 as amended the “code” commencing 

  

with our taxable year ended december 31 1985 and we intend to continue to operate in such a manner no assurance can be given that we have operated or will be able to continue to operate in a manner so as to qualify or to remain so qualified this summary is qualified in its entirety by the applicable code provisions rules and regulations promulgated thereunder and administrative and judicial interpretations thereof 

  

if we qualify for taxation as a reit we will generally not be required to pay federal corporate income taxes on the portion of our net income that is currently distributed to stockholders this treatment substantially eliminates the “double taxation” ie at the corporate and stockholder levels that generally results from investment in a corporation however we will be required to pay federal income tax under certain circumstances 

  

the code defines a reit as a corporation trust or association i which is managed by one or more trustees or directors ii the beneficial ownership of which is evidenced by transferable shares or by transferable certificates of beneficial interest iii which would be taxable but for sections 856 through 860 of the code as a domestic corporation iv which is neither a financial institution nor an insurance company subject to certain provisions of the code v the beneficial ownership of which is held by 100 or more persons vi during the last half of each taxable year not more than 50 in value of the outstanding stock of which is owned actually or constructively by five or fewer individuals and vii which meets certain other tests described below regarding the amount of its distributions and the nature of its income and assets the code provides that conditions i to iv inclusive must be met during the entire taxable year and that condition v must be met during at least 335 days of a taxable year of 12 months or during a proportionate part of a taxable year of less than 12 months 

  

there presently are two gross income requirements first at least 75 of our gross income excluding gross income from “prohibited transactions” as defined below for each taxable year must be derived directly or indirectly from investments relating to real property or mortgages on real property or from certain types of temporary investment income second at least 95 of our gross income excluding gross income from prohibited transactions for each taxable year must be derived from income that qualifies under the 75 test and all other dividends interest and gain from the sale or other disposition of stock or securities a “prohibited transaction” is a sale or other disposition of property other than foreclosure property held for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business 

  

at the close of each quarter of our taxable year we must also satisfy four tests relating to the nature of our assets first at least 75 of the value of our total assets must be represented by real estate assets certain stock or debt instruments purchased with the proceeds of a stock offering or long term public debt offering by us but only for the one year period after such offering cash cash items and government securities second not more than 25 of our total assets may be represented by securities other than those in the 75 asset class third of the investments included in the 25 asset class the value of any one issuer’s securities owned by us may not exceed 5 of the value of our total assets and we may not own more than 10 of the vote or value of the securities of a nonreit corporation other than certain debt securities and interests in taxable reit subsidiaries as defined below fourth not more than 20 of the value of our total assets may be represented by securities of one or more taxable reit subsidiaries 

  

we own interests in various partnerships and limited liability companies in the case of a reit that is a partner in a partnership or a member of a limited liability company that is treated as a partnership under the code treasury regulations provide that for purposes of the reit income and asset tests the reit will be deemed to own its proportionate share of the assets of the partnership or 

  

limited liability company and will be deemed to be entitled to the income of the partnership or limited liability company attributable to such share the ownership of an interest in a partnership or limited liability company by a reit may involve special tax risks including the challenge by the internal revenue service the “service” of the allocations of income and expense items of the partnership or limited liability company which would affect the computation of taxable income of the reit and the status of the partnership or limited liability company as a partnership as opposed to an association taxable as a corporation for federal income tax purposes we also own interests in a number of subsidiaries which are intended to be treated as qualified reit subsidiaries each a “qrs” the code provides that such subsidiaries will be ignored for federal income tax purposes and all assets liabilities and items of income deduction and credit of such subsidiaries will be treated as assets liabilities and such items of ours if any partnership limited liability company or subsidiary in which we own an interest were treated as a regular corporation and not as a partnership qrs or taxable reit subsidiary for federal income tax purposes we would likely fail to satisfy the reit asset tests described above and would therefore fail to qualify as a reit we believe that each of the partnerships limited liability companies and subsidiaries other than taxable reit subsidiaries in which we own an interest will be treated for tax purposes as a partnership or disregarded entity in the case of a 100 owned partnership or limited liability company or qrs respectively although no assurance can be given that the service will not successfully challenge the status of any such organization 

  

we also own interests in two subsidiaries which are intended to be treated as taxable reit subsidiaries each a “trs” a reit may own any percentage of the voting stock and value of the securities of a corporation which jointly elects with the reit to be a trs provided certain requirements are met a trs generally may engage in any business including the provision of customary or noncustomary services to tenants of its parent reit and of others except a trs may not manage or operate a hotel or health care facility a trs is treated as a regular corporation and is subject to federal income tax and applicable state income and franchise taxes at regular corporate rates in addition a 100 tax may be imposed on a reit if its rental service or other agreements with its trs or the trs’s agreements with the reits tenants are not on arms’ length terms 

  

in order to qualify as a reit we are required to distribute dividends other than capital gain dividends to our stockholders in an amount at least equal to a the sum of i 90 of our “real estate investment trust taxable income” computed without regard to the dividends paid deduction and our net capital gain and ii 90 of the net income if any after tax from foreclosure property minus b the sum of certain items of noncash income such distributions must be paid in the taxable year to which they relate or in the following taxable year if declared before we timely file our tax return for such year if paid on or before the first regular dividend payment date after such declaration and if we so elect and specify the dollar amount in our tax return to the extent that we do not distribute all of our net longterm capital gain or distribute at least 90 but less than 100 of our “real estate investment trust taxable income” as adjusted we will be required to pay tax thereon at regular corporate tax rates furthermore if we should fail to distribute during each calendar year at least the sum of i 85 of our ordinary income for such year ii 95 of our capital gain income for such year and iii any undistributed taxable income from prior periods we would be required to pay a 4 excise tax on the excess of such required distributions over the amounts actually distributed 

  

if we fail to qualify for taxation as a reit in any taxable year and certain relief provisions do not apply we will be required to pay tax including any applicable alternative minimum tax on our taxable income at regular corporate rates distributions to stockholders in any year in which we fail to 

  

qualify will not be deductible by us nor will they be required to be made unless entitled to relief under specific statutory provisions we will also be disqualified from taxation as a reit for the four taxable years following the year during which qualification was lost it is not possible to state whether in all circumstances we would be entitled to the statutory relief failure to qualify for even one year could substantially reduce distributions to stockholders and could result in our incurring substantial indebtedness to the extent borrowings are feasible or liquidating substantial investments in order to pay the resulting taxes 

  

we and our stockholders may be required to pay state or local tax in various state or local jurisdictions including those in which we or they transact business or reside the state and local tax treatment of us and our stockholders may not conform to the federal income tax consequences discussed above 

  

government regulation 

  

the health care industry is heavily regulated by federal state and local laws this government regulation of the health care industry affects us because 

  

    

these laws and regulations are subject to frequent and substantial changes resulting from legislation adoption of rules and regulations and administrative and judicial interpretations of existing law these changes may have a dramatic effect on the definition of permissible or impermissible activities the relative costs associated with doing business and the amount of reimbursement by both government and other thirdparty payors these changes may be applied retroactively the ultimate timing or effect of these changes cannot be predicted the failure of any borrower of funds from us or lessee of any of our properties to comply with such laws regulations and requirements could affect its ability to operate its facility or facilities and could adversely affect such borrower’s or lessee’s ability to make debt or lease payments to us 

  

fraud and abuse laws  there are various federal and state laws prohibiting fraud by health care providers who participate in receive payments from or are in a position to make referrals in connection with a governmentsponsored health care program including but not limited to the medicare and medicaid programs specifically section 1128bb of the social security act the “antikickback statute” the federal selfreferral law stark the false claims act and state laws analogous to these federal laws place restrictions on our leasees and other contractors that may affect their core health care operations 

  

federal antikickback statute  the antikickback statute prohibits among other things the offer payment solicitation or receipt of any form of remuneration in return for or to induce the referrals of medicare and medicaid patients limited “safe harbor” regulations define a narrow scope of practices that will be exempted from federal prosecution or other enforcement action under the antikickback statute and fail to exempt a wide range of activities frequently engaged in by health care providers and other third parties activities that fall outside the safe harbor rules are not 

  

necessarily illegal although they may be subject to the increased likelihood of scrutiny investigation or prosecution in each case the government must prove that in soliciting offering paying or accepting remuneration the parties to such activities intended to induce referrals a significant body of case law has developed in this area providing additional guidance as to the scope of the antikickback statute furthermore health care providers may seek advisory opinions from the centers for medicare  medicaid services cms concerning the legality of particular relationships subject to the antikickback statute’s prohibitions although advisory opinions are binding only on the parties to the opinion these opinions are often used as guidance in determining the legality of future arrangements 

  

violations of the antikickback statute may result in civil and criminal sanctions and penalties civil penalties include temporary or permanent exclusion from government health programs criminal sanctions include imprisonment for up to five years fines of up to 25000 or both for each violation the balanced budget act signed into law on august 5 1997 the “bba” expanded the sanctions under the antikickback statute to include civil monetary penalties up to 50000 for each prohibited act and up to three times the total amount of remuneration offered paid solicited or received without regard to whether a portion of such remuneration was offered paid solicited or received for a lawful purpose these penalties and sanctions could be applied with respect to many of our lessee and our other contractors including but not limited to professional services arrangements andor space or equipment leases or subleases many states have adopted or are considering legislative proposals similar to the federal antikickback statute some of which apply to the referral of patients for health care services reimbursed by any source not only the medicare and other federal government programs government sanctions imposed on our lessees and other contractors in violation of these laws could result in a material adverse effect on their operations which could in turn adversely affect our business 

  

federal physician selfreferral prohibition stark  absent qualifying for one of the stark limited exceptions stark restricts physicians who have financial relationships with health care providers from making referrals for certain designated health services for which payment may be made under medicare or medicaid programs to an entity with which the physician or an immediate family member has a “financial relationship” the stark provisions became effective january 1 1992 for clinical laboratory services stark i and january 1 1995 for ten other designated health services stark ii the final stark i regulations became effective on august 14 1995 and on january 4 2001 cms issued phase i of the final stark ii regulations phase i of the final stark ii regulations focuses on the stark provisions related to prohibited referrals the general exception to ownership and compensation financial arrangement prohibitions and the related definitions phase i of the final stark ii regulations clarifies the definition of designated health services and indirect financial relationships and creates new exceptions for indirect compensation arrangements and fair market value transactions most of phase i of the final stark ii regulations became effective on january 4 2002 phase ii of the final stark ii regulations was scheduled to be released in 2002 but has been delayed until sometime in 2003 phase ii of the final stark ii regulations is expected to cover the remaining portions of the stark statute including those sections relating to medicaid 

  

a “financial relationship” under the stark provisions includes any direct or indirect compensation arrangement with an entity for payment of any remuneration and any direct or indirect ownership or investment interest in the entity “designated health services” include inpatient and outpatient hospital services and do not include skilled nursing services but do include services which skilled nursing facilities provide to their patients including therapy durable medical equipment and enteral and parenteral nutrition penalties for violating the stark provisions include denial of payment 

  

from medicare and medicaid programs for any services rendered by an entity in violation of the prohibition civil monetary penalties of up to 15000 for each offense additional monetary penalties up to 100000 for circumvention schemes and exclusion from the medicare and medicaid programs 

  

several states have enacted andor are considering legislation that prohibits physician referral arrangements or requires physicians to disclose any financial interest they may have with a health care provider to their patients when referring patients to that provider the health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 “hipaa” and the bba expand the penalties for health care fraud including broader provisions for the exclusion of providers from the medicare and medicaid programs further under operation restore trust a major antifraud demonstration project the office of inspector general of the us department of health and human services in cooperation with other federal and state agencies has focused on the activities of skilled nursing facilities home health agencies hospices and durable medical equipment suppliers in certain states including california in which we have properties due to the success of operation restore trust the project has been expanded to numerous other states and to additional providers including providers of ancillary nursing home services 

  

false claims act  another trend affecting the health care industry is the increased use of the federal false claims act as a means to combat fraud and abuse among health care providers the false claims act prohibits any person from knowingly presenting false or fraudulent claims for payment to the federal government including the medicare and medicaid programs the false claims act provides for liability of up to three times the amount of damages which the government sustained due to the false claim as well as penalties of 5500 to 11000 per false claim therefore repeated submissions of a large number of claims based on small billing errors may be treated as multiple violations of the false claims act and can thus result in significant civil monetary penalties health care false claims may also subject providers to criminal and civil sanction under state false claims statutes as well as under common law fraud statutes 

  

although violations of the false claims act are ordinarily initiated by the relevant government agency such violations can also be initiated by individuals under the qui tam  or whistleblower provisions of the false claim act the qui tam provisions allow individuals with knowledge of false claims act violations to bring suit under the false claims act on behalf of the federal government qui tam plaintiffs may be awarded a significant percentage of the ultimate amount recovered by the government 

  

recently several false claims act cases have been filed based at least in part on alleged violations of federal health care statutes such as the antikickback statute and stark in addition various states are considering or have enacted laws modeled after the federal false claims act even in instances when a whistleblower action is dismissed with no judgment or settlement the lessee may incur substantial legal fees and other costs relating to an investigation certain lessees have been faced with whistleblower suits by former employees alleging noncompliance with medicare rules and regulations for instance the us department of justice recently joined a whistleblower suit filed against integrated health services inc which alleges that the company admitted and retained patients in its longterm care hospitals who did not require acute care and billed medicare for these allegedly unnecessary services some medicare fiscal intermediaries private companies that contract with cms to administer the medicare program have also increased scrutiny of cost reports filed by longterm care providers findings of violations of the fraud and abuse laws and regulations may jeopardize a 

  

borrower’s or lessee’s ability to operate a facility or to make rent and debt payments thereby potentially adversely affecting us 

  

civil monetary penalties law in lieu of or in addition to criminal proceedings against a person or entity that has committed a fraudulent act the secretary of the department of health and human services is authorized to impose an administrative civil monetary payment under the civil monetary penalties law “cmp law” the penalty provisions include all federal health care programs the amount of the fine is up to 10000 for each item or service fraudulently claimed for reimbursement in addition under the cmp law a damage assessment of up to three times the amount claimed for each claim for services may be assessed our lease arrangements with lessees may also be subject to these fraud and abuse laws federal and state laws governing illegal rebates and kickbacks regulate contingent or percentage rent arrangements where our coinvestors are physicians or others in a position to refer patients to the facilities although only limited interpretive or enforcement guidance is available we have structured our rent arrangements in a manner that we believe complies with such laws and regulations 

  

we have no knowledge that would lead us to believe that the facilities in which we have investments are not in substantial compliance with the various regulatory requirements applicable to them although there can be no assurance that the operators are in compliance or will remain in compliance in the future 

  

licensure risks  most health care facilities must obtain a license from the state in which they operate failure to obtain licensure or loss of licensure would prevent a facility from its ability to provide health care services on the premises these events could adversely affect the facility operator’s ability to make rent and debt payments state and local laws also may regulate expansion including the addition of new beds or services or acquisition of medical equipment and occasionally the contraction of health care facilities by requiring certificate of need or other similar approval programs in addition health care facilities are obligated to comply with the americans with disabilities act and building and safety codes which govern access to and physical design requirements and building standards for facilities 

  

environmental matters  a wide variety of federal state and local environmental and occupational health and safety laws and regulations affect health care facility operations under various federal state and local environmental laws ordinances and regulations an owner of real property or a secured lender such as us may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of hazardous or toxic substances at under or disposed of in connection with such property as well as other potential costs relating to hazardous or toxic substances including government fines and damages for injuries to persons and adjacent property such laws often impose such liability without regard to whether the owner or secured lender knew of or was responsible for the presence or disposal of such substances and may be imposed on the owner or secured lender in connection with the activities of an operator of the property the cost of any required remediation removal fines or personal or property damages and the owner’s or secured lender’s liability therefore could exceed the value of the property andor the assets of the owner or secured lender in addition the presence of such substances or the failure to properly dispose of or remediate such substances may adversely affect the owner’s ability to sell or rent such property or to borrow using such property as collateral which in turn would reduce our revenue 

  

  

although the mortgage loans that we provide and leases covering our properties require the borrower and the lessee to indemnify us for certain environmental liabilities the scope of such obligations may be limited and we cannot assure that any such borrower or lessee would be able to fulfill its indemnification obligations 

  

the federal medicare and medicaid programs  sources of revenue for lessees and mortgagors may include the federal medicare program state medicaid programs private insurance carriers health care service plans and health maintenance organizations among others efforts to reduce costs by these payors will likely continue which may result in reduced or slower growth in reimbursement for certain services provided by some of our operators in addition the failure of any of our operators to comply with various laws and regulations could jeopardize their certification and their ability to continue to participate in the medicare and medicaid programs 

  

prospective payment for hospital inpatient services medicare payments to acute care hospitals for inpatient services are based on a prospective payment system “pps” under pps a hospital is paid a prospectively established rate based on the category “diagnostic related group” or “drg” in which a patient’s diagnosis is classified beginning in 1991 medicare payments began to phasein pps for capitalrelated inpatient costs over a ten year period thus current medicare reimbursement to hospitals for capitalrelated inpatient costs is based on prospective rates rather than the costbased reimbursement system previously used drg rates are subject to adjustment on an annual basis as part of the federal budget reconciliation process in addition the bba mandated the establishment of prospective payment systems for skilled nursing facilities home health agencies hospital outpatient departments and rehabilitation hospitals see “health care reform” section and further discussion following 

  

prospective payment for hospital outpatient services  beginning in august 2000 cms began to reimburse items and services furnished in hospital outpatient departments under a prospective payment system “outpatient pps” under which all services are categorized into groups called ambulatory payment classifications “apcs” each apc is comprised of a bundle of like outpatient services that are reimbursed at a prospectively established payment rate hospitals are reimbursed additional amounts for certain drugs biologies and technologies apc rates are subject to adjustment on an annual basis 

  

prospective payment for skilled nursing facilities  prior to july 1 1998 medicare programs utilized a costbased reimbursement system for skilled nursing facilities which reimbursed these facilities for the reasonable direct and indirect allowable costs incurred in providing routine services plus in certain states a return on equity subject to certain cost ceilings these costs normally included allowances for administrative and general costs as well as the costs of property and equipment depreciation and interest fair rental allowance or rental expense costbased reimbursement was typically subject to retrospective adjustment through cost report settlement and for certain states payments made to a facility on an interim basis that were subsequently determined to be less than or in excess of allowable costs could be adjusted through future payments to the affected facility state medicaid reimbursement programs varied as to the methodology used to determine the level of allowable costs which were reimbursed to operators 

  

the bba mandated implementation of a per diem prospective payment system to be implemented for skilled nursing facilities “snf pps” under which skilled nursing facilities are paid a casemix adjusted federal per diem rate for medicarecovered services provided by the skilled nursing 

  

facilities the per diem rate is calculated to cover routine service costs ancillary costs and most capitalrelated costs see further discussion under health care reform the snf pps federal rates are adjusted based upon casemix and geography and are subject to annual updates the phasedin implementation of the snf pps began with the first cost reporting period beginning on or after july 1 1998 

  

prospective payment for longterm acute care hospitals  although most hospitals were transferred to the pps reimbursement methodology in 1983 certain specialty hospitals were excluded from that system ltacs were one of the exempted types of specialty hospitals faced with escalating health care costs however congress mandated that by october 1 2002 ltacs be transitioned from a reasonable costbased reimbursement system to a congressionally mandated prospective payment system “ltac pps” cms has met the statutory implementation date mandate by establishing october 2 2002 as the effective date of the ltac pps with system changes to follow the full impact of the new reimbursement methodology is still to be seen 

  

state medicaid programs medicaid programs differ in respect from state to state but they are all subject to federallyimposed requirements at least 50 of the funds available under these programs is provided by the federal government under a matching program medicaid programs generally pay for acute and rehabilitative care based on reasonable costs at fixed rates longterm care facilities are generally reimbursed using fixed daily rates medicaid payments are generally below retail rates for lesseeoperated facilities increasingly states have introduced managed care contracting techniques in the administration of medicaid programs such mechanisms could have the impact of reducing utilization of and reimbursement to lesseeoperated facilities 

  

other third party payors in various states and areas base payments on costs retail rates or increasingly negotiated rates negotiated rates can include discounts from normal charges fixed daily rates and prepaid capitated rates 

  

regulations affecting longterm care facilities longterm care facilities are regulated primarily through the licensing of such facilities against a common background established by federal law enacted as part of the omnibus budget reconciliation act of 1987 regulatory authorities and licensing standards vary from state to state and in some instances from locality to locality these standards are constantly reviewed and revised state agencies periodically inspect facilities to determine whether they comply with state andor federal regulations at which time deficiencies may be identified the facilities must correct these deficiencies as a condition to continued licensing or certification and participation in government reimbursement programs depending on the nature of such deficiencies remedies can be routine or costly similarly compliance with regulations which cover a broad range of areas such as patients’ rights staff training quality of life and quality of resident care may increase facility startup and operating costs 

  

in 1999 and 2000 congress increased funding for state health agencies in order to allow state agencies that conduct skilled nursing facility inspections to intensify medicare and medicaid regulatory enforcement efforts cms has instructed these state agencies to increase the number of unannounced facility inspections and to investigate consumer complaints about skilled nursing facilities promptly as a result of these increased enforcement efforts some of our lessees may be subject to fines and other penalties that could increase their operating costs 

  

  

acute care hospitals  acute care hospitals are also subject to extensive federal state and local regulation acute care hospitals undergo periodic inspections regarding standards of medical care equipment and hygiene as a condition of state licensure various licenses and permits also are required for purchasing and administering narcotics operating laboratories and pharmacies and the use of radioactive materials and certain equipment each of our facilities the operation of which requires accreditation is accredited by the joint commission on accreditation of healthcare organizations such accreditation may be a more costeffective and timeefficient method of meeting requirements for continued licensing and for participation in government sponsored provider programs 

  

acute care hospitals must comply with requirements for various forms of utilization review in addition under pps each state must have a peer review organization also known as a quality improvement organization to carry out federally funded mandated reviews of medicare patient admissions treatment and discharges in acute care hospitals 

  

assisted living facilities  certain assisted living facilities are subject to federal state and local licensure certification and inspection laws these laws regulate among other matters the number of licensed beds the provision of services equipment staffing and operating policies and procedures failure to comply with these laws and regulations could result in the denial of reimbursement the imposition of fines suspension from federal and state health care programs and in extreme cases decertification from federal and state health care programs revocation of a facility’s operating license or closure of a facility such actions may have an effect on the revenue of the operators of properties owned by or mortgaged to us and therefore adversely impact us 

  

entrance fee communities  certain of the facilities mortgaged to or owned by us are operated as entrance fee communities generally an entrance fee is an upfront fee or consideration paid by a resident in exchange for some form of longterm benefit typically entrance fees are broken into two components a refundable component and a nonrefundable component the percentage of each component varies based upon the different contract alternatives at each entrance fee community some of the entrance fee communities are subject to significant state regulatory oversight including for example oversight of each facility’s financial condition establishment and monitoring of reserve requirements and other financial restrictions the right of residents to cancel their contracts within a specified period of time lien rights in favor of the residents restrictions on change of ownership and similar matters such oversight and the rights of residents within these entrance fee communities may have an effect on the revenue or operations of the operators of such facilities and therefore adversely impact us 

  

physician group practice clinics  physician group practice clinics are subject to extensive federal state and local legislation and regulation every state imposes licensing requirements on individual physicians and on facilities and services operated by physicians in addition federal and state laws regulate health maintenance organizations and other managed care organizations with which physician groups may have contracts many states require regulatory approval including certificates of need before establishing certain types of physiciandirected clinics offering certain services or making expenditures in excess of statutory thresholds for health care equipment facilities or programs in connection with the expansion of existing operations and the entry into new markets physician clinics and affiliated practice groups may become subject to compliance with additional regulation 

  

rehabilitation hospitals  rehabilitation hospitals are subject to extensive federal state and local legislation regulation inspection and licensure requirements similar to those of acute care 

  

  

hospitals many states have adopted a “patient’s bill of rights” which provides for certain higher standards for patient care that are designed to decrease restrictions and enhance dignity in treatment 

  

health care reform 

  

the health care industry continues to face various challenges including increased government and private payor pressure on health care providers to control costs the migration of patients from acute care facilities into extended care and home care settings and the vertical and horizontal consolidation of health care providers the pressure to control health care costs intensified during 1994 and 1995 as a result of the national health care reform debate and continued as congress attempted to slow the rate of growth of federal health care expenditures as part of its effort to balance the federal budget 

  

changes in the law new interpretations of existing laws and changes in payment methodologies may have a dramatic effect on the definition of permissible or impermissible activities the relative costs associated with doing business and the amount of reimbursement furnished by both government and other thirdparty payors these changes may be applied retroactively under certain circumstances the ultimate timing or effect of legislative efforts cannot be predicted and may impact us in different ways 

  

the balanced budget act of 1997 the bba was designed to produce several billion dollars in net savings for the medicare and medicaid programs over the five years following enactment 

  

the bba repealed the boren amendment under which states were required to pay longterm care providers including skilled nursing facilities rates that were “reasonable and adequate to meet the cost which must be incurred by efficiently and economically operated facilities” as a result states are now required by the bba to do the following with respect to skilled nursing facility rates 

  

     

in determining reimbursement rates consideration is given to health care providers that serve a disproportionate number of lowincome patients with special needs the secretary of the department of health and human services is required to conduct a study concerning the effect of ratesetting methodologies on the access to and the quality of services provided to medicare and medicaid beneficiaries and report the study results to congress 

  

the bba also provides the federal government with expanded enforcement powers to combat waste fraud and abuse in delivery of health care services and promulgated larger penalties for fraud and abuse violations though applicable to payments for services furnished on or after october 1 1997 the new requirements are not retroactive the bba also strengthened the antifraud and abuse laws to provide for stiffer penalties for fraud and abuse violations as discussed previously 

  

  

the bba also reduced the payments made to longterm acute care hospitals “ltacs” regarding ltacs the bba reduced the amount of reimbursement for incentive payments established pursuant to the tax equity and fiscal responsibility act of 1982 “tefra” for capital expenditures and bad debts and for services to certain patients transferred from an acute care hospital in addition the bba for the first time imposed a national ceiling limitation or “national cap” on payments that may be made in each category of hospitals exempt from a prospective payment system ltacs constitute one such category the reduction in payments to ltacs mandated by the bba may adversely effect an ltac operator’s ability to develop or acquire ltacs in the future 

  

the balanced budget refinement act of 1999  in november 1999 president clinton signed into law the medicare medicaid and state children’s health insurance policy schip balanced budget refinement act of 1999 “bbra” which reduces some of the reimbursement cutbacks enacted under the bba the bbra delayed implementation of costcutting measures and increased payments to some sectors of the health care industry the bbra increased payments to longterm care facilities and lessened cutbacks made to disproportionate share hospital payments the bbra also provided that changes to the outpatient pps must be budget neutral and not result in reduced reimbursement the extent of the financial relief to be provided by the bbra is estimated to be 16 billion over five years 

  

the medicare medicaid and schip benefits improvement and protection act of 2000 in december 2000 president clinton signed the medicare medicaid and schip benefits improvement and protection act of 2000 “bipa” which provides for acrosstheboard medicare and medicaid payment increases for most health care providers overall passage of bipa is expected to result in approximately 35 billion in additional reimbursement for providers over the next five years additionally the bipa extends the moratorium on implementation of a cap for outpatient therapy services throughout 2002 payments for home health services hospice services and ltac services will also increase under the provisions of the bipa 

  

with respect to skilled nursing facilities to supplement the transition from costbased reimbursement to snf pps the bbra and bipa mandated that skilled nursing facilities temporarily receive certain payments in addition to straight snf pps reimbursement for two of the temporary addon payments that were set to expire on september 30 2002 cms extended the expiration date to at least fiscal year 2004 the remaining two addon payments however did expire as of september 30 2002 industry advocates predict that the expiration of the latter two addon payments will cost skilled nursing facilities approximately 14 billion in fiscal year 2003 which could represent a loss of as much as 30 per resident per day 

  

other federal initiatives will result in greater operational expenditures for health care providers for instance hipaa requires a significant overhaul of health care information systems to protect individually identifiable medical information and to standardize formatting of health care claims via electronic data codes in november 1999 the department of health and human services released proposed privacy regulations to protect the confidentiality of individual health information final privacy regulations were released in december 2000 generally health care providers must comply with the hipaa privacy regulations by april 14 2003 the federal government has estimated that the united states health care industry will spend approximately 18 billion over a tenyear period in order to achieve compliance with these new privacy requirements 

  

  

in august 2000 the us department of health and human services also released final regulations that delineated uniform national standards for the electronic exchange of medical information and filing of claims under hipaa health care providers must have complied with these regulations relating to electronic data by october 16 2002 or have received a waiver from the department to extend the deadline for compliance to october 16 2003 the federal government estimates that hipaa compliance will cost health care providers approximately 35 billion however the federal government has predicted that implementation of these uniform data standards will help to speed conversion from manual to electronic billing systems resulting in cost savings to health care providers of approximately 30 billion over the next decade 

  

in addition to the reforms enacted and considered by congress from time to time state legislatures periodically consider various health care reform proposals congress and state legislatures can be expected to continue to review and assess alternative health care delivery systems new regulatory enforcement initiatives and new payment methodologies public debate of these issues can be expected to continue in the future there are numerous initiatives at the federal and state levels for comprehensive reforms affecting the payment for and delivery of health care services changes in the law new interpretations of existing laws and changes in payment methodology and enforcement priorities may have a dramatic effect on the definition of permissible or impermissible activities the relative costs associated with doing business and the amount of reimbursement by both government and other thirdparty payors these changes may be applied retroactively the ultimate timing or effect of legislative efforts cannot be predicted and may impact us in different ways 

  

national health care spending accelerated 87 percent in 2001 reaching 14 trillion in total or 5035 per capita prompted mostly by sluggish economic growth and to some extent by fasterpaced health spending the share of gross domestic product for health care spiked 08 percentage points in 2001 to 141 percent total public funding continued to accelerate increasing 94 percent in 2001 and exceeding private funding growth for the second consecutive year public payments rose to 647 billion and paid for 45 percent of the nation’s health important sources of growth were payment increases to medicare providers by the bbra and bipa as well as increased medicaid spending medicare expenditures increased 78 percent to 242 billion is 2001 and financed onesixth of overall health care costs with expenditures only slightly less than medicare’s federal and state medicaid funded 224 billion in 2001 the weak economy and rising unemployment contributed to increased medicaid enrollment up 85 percent and to a faster pace of spending growth in 2001 up 108 percent than in 2000 up 88 percent we believe that government and private efforts to contain or reduce health care costs will continue these trends are likely to lead to reduced or slower growth in reimbursement for certain services provided by some of our lessees and mortgagors we believe that the vast nature of the health care industry the financial strength and operating flexibility of our operators and the diversity of our portfolio will mitigate the impact of any such diminution in reimbursements however we cannot predict whether any of the above proposals or any other proposals will be adopted and if adopted no assurance can be given that the implementation of such reforms will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 

  

objectives and policies 

  

we are organized to invest in incomeproducing health care related facilities in evaluating potential investments we consider such factors as 

  

   

             

there are no limitations on the percentage of our total assets that may be invested in any one property or partnership the investment committee of the board of directors may establish limitations as it deems appropriate from time to time no limits have been set on the number of properties in which we will seek to invest or on the concentration of investments in any one facility or any one city or state we acquire our investments primarily for income 

  

at december 31 2002 we had three series of preferred stock 1779 million in mortgage notes payable and 8881 million in aggregate principal amount of debt securities which are senior to the common stock we may in the future issue additional debt or equity securities which will be senior to the common stock we have authority to offer shares of our capital stock in exchange for investments which conform to our standards and to repurchase or otherwise acquire our shares or other securities 

  

we may incur additional indebtedness when in the opinion of our management and directors it is advisable for shortterm purposes we from time to time negotiate lines of credit or arrange for other shortterm borrowings from banks or otherwise we arrange for longterm borrowings through public offerings or from institutional investors 

  

in addition we may incur additional mortgage indebtedness on real estate which we have acquired through purchase foreclosure or otherwise where leverage is present on terms deemed favorable we invest in properties subject to existing loans or secured by mortgages deeds of trust or similar liens on the properties we also may obtain nonrecourse or other mortgage financing on unleveraged properties in which we have invested or may refinance properties acquired on a leveraged basis 

  

in march 2001 we introduced a new dividend reinvestment and stock purchase plan the “plan” under the terms of the plan existing stockholders may purchase shares of common stock by reinvesting all or a portion of the cash dividends from their shares of common stock or by making optional cash payments to purchase additional shares of common stock 

  

on june 20 2000 we adopted a stockholder rights plan and declared a dividend of one preferred share purchase right for each outstanding share of our common stock the rights will become exercisable if a person or group of affiliated or associated persons has acquired or obtained the right to acquire beneficial ownership of 15 or more of our common stock or following the commencement or announcement of an intention to make a tender offer or exchange offer the

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

  

general 

  

health care property investors inc including its whollyowned subsidiaries and affiliated joint ventures hcpi generally acquires health care facilities and leases them on a longterm basis to health care providers we also lease medical office space to providers and physicians on a shorter term basis in addition we provide mortgage financing on health care facilities as of december 31 2002 our portfolio of properties including equity investments consisted of 463 facilities located in 43 states these facilities are comprised of 184 longterm care facilities 101 assisted living facilities 90 medical office buildings including five health and wellness centers 35 physician group practice clinics 22 acute care hospitals 14 retirement living communities nine freestanding rehabilitation facilities and eight health care laboratory and biotech research facilities our gross investment in the properties which includes our proportional interest in joint venture acquisitions was approximately 31 billion at december 31 2002 

  

the primary focus of operations for 2002 was the completion of 417 million of new investments we financed the acquisitions primarily through the proceeds from the issuance of new debt new equity and asset sales 

  

during the year ended december 31 2002 we completed 232000000 in property acquisitions invested 155000000 in new loans and equity opportunities and committed to 30000000 of new construction and expansion projects for a total 417000000 of new investments during the year ended december 31 2001 we completed 190000000 in property acquisitions invested 10000000 in new loans and equity opportunities and committed to 40000000 of new construction and expansion projects for a total 240000000 of new investments 

  

accounting estimates 

  

the following are our significant accounting policies and the associated estimates and the issues which impact those estimates 

  

revenue recognition 

  

revenue is recorded in accordance with sec staff accounting bulletin no 101 revenue recognition in financial statements sab 101 as amended sab 101 requires that revenue be recognized after four basic criteria are met these four criteria include persuasive evidence of an arrangement the rendering of service fixed and determinable income and reasonably assured collectibility if the collectibility of revenue is determined incorrectly the amount and timing of our reported revenue could be significantly affected see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements 

  

allowance for doubtful accounts 

  

rental revenue from our tenants is our principal source of revenue we monitor the liquidity and creditworthiness of our tenants on an ongoing basis based on these reviews we have established provisions and maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the possible inability of our tenants to make required rent payments an allowance for doubtful 

  

  

accounts is recorded during each period and is recorded against rental revenue in our consolidated statements of operations the total amount of the allowance for doubtful accounts which represents the cumulative allowances less writeoffs of uncollectible rent is recorded against tenant and other receivables on our consolidated balance sheets if we incorrectly estimate the required allowances for doubtful accounts our financial condition and results of operations could be significantly affected 

  

depreciation and useful lives of assets 

  

we compute depreciation on our properties using the straightline method based on an estimated useful life ranging up to 45 years a significant portion of the acquisition cost of each property is allocated to building usually approximately 90 the allocation of the acquisition cost to building and the determination of the useful life of a property are based on appraisals commissioned from independent real estate appraisal firms we compute depreciation on equipment tenant improvements and lease costs using the straightline method on an estimated useful life ranging up to 10 years or the lease term whichever is appropriate if we do not allocate appropriately to building or incorrectly estimate the useful life of our properties the computation of depreciation will not appropriately reflect the allocation of our capital expenditures over future periods 

  

impairment of longlived assets 

  

we periodically review longlived assets primarily real estate investments in unconsolidated joint ventures and notes receivable for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable the determination of the fair value of the investment involves significant judgment this judgment is based on analysis of the future operating results or projected rents for each longlived asset our ability to accurately predict future cash flows may impact the determination of fair value 

  

if a decline in the fair market value of a longlived asset occurs we may be required to make determination as to whether the decline in fair value is other than temporary our assessment as to the nature of a decline in fair value is primarily based on estimates of expectations of future rents or future operating results and our intent to hold the longlived asset if an investment is considered impaired and the decline in value is considered to be other than temporary a writedown is recognized 

  

discontinued operations 

  

we have reclassified certain facilities’ operations as discontinued operations in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 144 “accounting for the impairment or disposal of longlived assets” statement 144 which was issued in august 2001 statement 144 established accounting and reporting standards requiring that longlived assets to be disposed of be reported as discontinued operations if management has committed to a plan to sell the asset under usual and customary terms within one year of establishing the plan to sell see note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for the impact of statement 144 on previously reported periods 

  

stock options 

  

as of january 1 2002 we commenced recognizing compensation expense in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 123 “accounting for stock based compensation” statement 123 the implementation of statement 123 is prospective and therefore 2001 operating 

  

  

results have not been impacted we use the black scholes model for calculating stock option expense this model requires us to make certain estimates including stock volatility discount rate and the termination discount factor if we incorrectly estimate these variables our results of operations could be affected 

  

results of operations 

  

year ended december 31 2002 as compared to year ended december 31 2001 

  

net income applicable to common shares for the year ended december 31 2002 totaled 112480000 or 193 per share on a diluted basis on revenue of 359576000 this compares to net income applicable to common shares of 96266000 or 178 per share on a diluted basis on revenue of 328116000 for 2001 included in net income applicable to common shares for the year ended december 31 2002 is a net loss on real estate dispositions of 1130000 or 002 per share on a diluted basis and a writedown of 9200000 or 015 per share on a diluted basis to fair value of eight facilities see note 3 to the consolidated financial statements included in net income applicable to common shares for the year ended december 31 2001 is a net loss on real estate dispositions of 5048000 or 009 per share on a diluted basis and a writedown of 7360000 or 014 per share on a diluted basis to fair value of seven facilities 

  

rental income attributable to triplenet leases for the year ended december 31 2002 increased 76 or 16959000 to 240537000 the increase is primarily the result of acquisitions made during 2001 and 2002 which resulted in the addition of 39 more facilities see note 3 to the consolidated financial statements rental income attributable to managed properties for the year ended december 31 2002 increased 103 or 8512000 to 91200000 with a related increase in managed properties operating expenses of 110 or 3256000 to 32720000 these increases were generated primarily from 2001 and 2002 acquisition and construction activity which resulted in the addition of 17 more facilities see note 3 to the consolidated financial statements interest and other income for the year ended december 31 2002 increased 274 or 5989000 to 27839000 as a result of the new loan with arc see note 6 to the consolidated financial statements as well as a loan prepayment fee we collected in the fourth quarter of 2002 

  

interest expense for the year ended december 31 2002 decreased 537000 to 77952000 the decrease is primarily due to the refinancing of 124579000 of longterm debt with lower rate shortterm and longterm debt real estate depreciation increased 9 or 6383000 to 75722000 for the year ended december 31 2002 as a result of the 2002 and 2001 acquisitions general and administrative expenses for the year ended december 31 2002 increased 40 or 5233000 to 18408000 the increase is primarily the result of costs of 2600000 related to vacant and troubled properties and compensation costs as of january 1 2002 we commenced recognizing compensation expense in accordance with statement 123 see note 17 to the consolidated financial statements 

  

we believe that funds from operations ffo is an important supplemental measure of operating performance for a real estate investment trust see note 15 to the consolidated financial statements ffo for the year ended december 31 2002 increased 111 or 19835000 to 199210000 the increase is mainly attributable to investments made during 2002 offset by increases in general and administrative costs 

  

we adopted the definition of ffo prescribed by the national association of real estate investment trusts nareit ffo is defined as net income applicable to common shares computed 

  

  

in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles excluding gains or losses from debt restructuring and sales of property plus real estate depreciation and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures ffo does not and is not intended to represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles is not necessarily indicative of cash available to fund cash needs and should not be considered as an alternative to net income ffo as defined by us may not be comparable to similarly entitled items reported by other reits that do not define it in accordance with the definition prescribed by nareit the following table represents items and amounts being aggregated to compute ffo 

  

   

year ended december 31 2001 as compared to year ended december 31 2000 

  

net income applicable to common shares for the year ended december 31 2001 totaled 96266000 or 178 per share on a diluted basis on revenue of 328116000 this compares to net income applicable to common shares of 108867000 or 213 per share on a diluted basis on revenue of 325358000 for the corresponding period in 2000 included in net income applicable to common shares for the years ended december 31 2001 and 2000 is a loss real estate dispositions of 5048000 or 090 per share on a diluted basis and a gain on real estate dispositions of 11756000 or 023 per share on a diluted basis respectively in addition net income applicable to common shares for the year ended december 31 2001 includes a writedown of 7360000 or 014 per share on a diluted basis to fair market value of seven facilities included in net income applicable to common shares for the year ended december 31 2000 are a 2000000 or 004 per share on a diluted basis onetime charge as a result of an equity investment writeoff and a 2751000 or 005 per share on a diluted basis onetime charge as a result of the writedown to fair value less costs to sell of four physician clinics to be sold the increase in net income applicable to common shares is primarily the result of 2000 acquisition activity 

  

rental income attributable to triple net leases for the year ended december 31 2001 decreased 02 or 675000 to 223578000 the decrease is primarily the result of the impact of dispositions made during 2000 and 2001 offset by acquisition activity during 2001 rental income attributable to managed properties for the year ended december 31 2001 increased 57 or 4458000 to 82688000 with a related increase in managed properties operating expenses of 73 or 2010000 to 29464000 these increases were generated primarily from 2001 acquisition activity which resulted in the addition of 13 facilities interest and other income for the year ended december 31 2001 decreased 45 or 1025000 to 21850000 primarily as a result of a loan payoff in the first quarter of 2001 

  

  

interest expense for the year ended december 31 2001 decreased 95 or 8258000 to 78489000 the decrease is primarily the result of lower balances and interest rates on shortterm bank loans all described in more detail within the “liquidity and capital resources” section real estate depreciation increased 731000 to 69339000 as a result of 2001 acquisitions 

  

ffo for the year ended december 31 2001 increased 47 or 8031000 to 179375000 the increase is mainly attributable to increases in rental income as offset by increases in interest expense and managed properties operating expenses previously discussed in more detail 

  

liquidity and capital resources 

  

we have financed investments through the sale of common and preferred stock the issuance of longterm debt the assumption of mortgage debt the mortgaging of certain of our properties the use of shortterm bank lines the use of internally generated cash flows and through the disposition of assets management believes that our liquidity and sources of capital are adequate to finance our operations for the foreseeable future future investments in additional facilities see note 9 to the consolidated financial statements will be dependent on the availability of costeffective sources of capital 

  

at december 31 2002 stockholders’ equity totaled 1280889000 our debt to equity ratio was 104 to 100 for the year ended december 31 2002 ffo before interest expense covered interest expense 350 to 100

we used the net equity proceeds to pay down shortterm borrowings under our revolving lines of credit pending deployment on longterm investments we invested any excess funds in shortterm investments until they were needed for acquisitions or development 

  

as of december 31 2002 there were a total of 1678512 nonmanaging member units outstanding in three limited liability companies of which we are the managing member hcpiutah llc hcpiutah ii llc and hcpiindiana llc these nonmanaging member units are currently convertible into our common stock on a oneforone basis during 2002 we issued 126250 nonmanaging member units of hcpiutah ii llc as part of the acquisition of one medical office building and one health care laboratory and biotech research facility in addition during 2002 124487 nonmanaging member units were converted into the same number of shares of our common stock

facility rollovers 

  

we have concluded a significant number of “facility rollover” transactions on properties that have been under longterm leases and mortgages facility rollover transactions principally include lease renewals and renegotiations leases with new operators on an existing property exchanges sales of properties and payoffs on mortgage receivables the annualized impact on a pro forma ffo basis as if the facility rollover transactions had occurred on january 1 of each year and the number of facility rollovers is listed below sales of properties and mortgage receivable pay off proceeds are assumed to be reinvested at 10 for purposes of the table

facility operators 

  

tenet 

  

tenet healthcare corporation “tenet” leases from us eight acute care hospitals and one medical office building in which we have an aggregate investment of 460000000 rents from these hospitals constitute approximately 16 of our revenue according to news reports the us department of justice recently filed a lawsuit against tenet for allegedly submitting fraudulent claims to medicare the lawsuit seeks to recover an unspecified amount of triple damages and civil penalties under the false claims act tenet announced their intention to adopt new policies as of january 1 2003 we estimate that if payments at our eight tenet operated hospitals are reduced in proportion to tenet’s announcement rents paid to us would decrease by 500000 per year and the cash flow coverage of rents after management fees would decrease from 51 to 45 

  

  

troubled longterm care and assisted living operators 

  

the financial weakness of operators in the longterm care and assisted living sectors may result in some uncertainties in our ability to continue to realize the full benefit of such operators’ leases we cannot assure you that the bankruptcies of certain longterm care operators and the trouble experienced by assisted living operators would not have a material adverse effect on our net income ffo or the market value of our common stock see note 5 to the consolidated financial statements

in early december 2002 we sent default and lease termination notices to centennial healthcare corporation and certain of its subsidiaries “centennial” for nonpayment of rent under 17 leases and nonpayment of interest and principal under a secured loan and to a third party lessee for nonpayment of rent on three facilities managed by centennial on december 20 2002 centennial filed voluntary petitions for chapter 11 reorganization with the us bankruptcy court 

  

on december 31 2002 we had net rent and interest receivables due from centennial and the third party lessees of three facilities managed by centennial of approximately 43 million letters of credit aggregating 44 million securing rent and loan payments due from centennial were collected on january 2 2003 

  

the total obligations of centennial and the third party lessees under the 20 leases and the loan are approximately 900000 per month our gross investment in the 20 leased facilities and the facility subject to the secured loan was approximately 67 million and the current book value net of depreciation is approximately 42 million at december 31 2002 

  

we are in the process of transferring operations of ten facilities operated by centennial to our existing lessees operations of nine other facilities may remain with centennial and the remaining four facilities will go to new lessees we now anticipate that initial monthly payments under new leases will be approximately 50 of the current required monthly payments under the existing leases 

  

sun healthcare 

  

sun healthcare did not pay february 2003 rent and requested that we terminate the leases for four facilities leased directly from us annual rent on the four facilities aggregated 2400000 in 2002 we are actively negotiating terms with replacement operators for these facilities at year end sun operated five other facilities through subleases and management contracts and our annual rental income on those five facilities for 2002 was approximately 3200000 three of these five properties are now operated by a third party we preliminarily estimate that fair market annual rents are 1000000 less than rents on the six facilities operated by sun the current book value of the nine facilities net of depreciation was approximately 27 million at december 31 2002 

  

cautionary language regarding forward looking statements 

  

statements in this annual report that are not historical factual statements are “forward looking statements” within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 the statements include among other things statements regarding the intent belief or expectations of 

  

  

hcpi and its officers and can be identified by the use of terminology such as “may” “will” “expect” “believe” “intend” “plan” “estimate” “should” and other comparable terms or the negative thereof in addition we through our senior management from time to time make forward looking oral and written public statements concerning our expected future operations and other developments readers are cautioned that while forward looking statements reflect our good faith belief and best judgment based upon current information they are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties actual results may differ materially from the expectations contained in the forward looking statements as a result of various factors in addition to the factors set forth under the caption risk factors in this annual report readers should consider the following 

  

          

item 7a disclosures about market risk 

  

our investments are financed by the sale of common and preferred stock longterm and mediumterm debt internally generated cash flows and some shortterm bank debt 

  

we generally have fixed base rent on our leases in addition there can be additional rent based on a percentage of increased revenue over specified base period revenue of the properties andor increases based on inflation indices or other factors financing costs are comprised of dividends on preferred and common stock fixed interest on longterm and mediumterm debt and shortterm interest on bank debt 

  

on a more limited basis we have provided mortgage loans to operators of health care facilities in the normal course of business all of the mortgage loans receivable have fixed interest rates or interest rates with periodic fixed increases therefore the mortgage loans receivable are all considered to be fixed rate loans and the current interest rate the lowest rate is used in the computation of market risk provided in the following table if material 

  

  

we may assume existing mortgage notes payable as part of an acquisition transaction currently we have two mortgage notes payable with variable interest rates and the remaining mortgage notes payable have fixed interest rates or interest rates with fixed periodic increases our senior notes are at fixed rates with one exception for a 25000000 variable rate senior note for which management has fixed the interest rate by means of a swap contract the variable rate loans are at interest rates below the current prime rate of 425 and fluctuations are tied to the prime rate or to a rate currently below the prime rate 

  

at december 31 2002 we are exposed to market risks related to fluctuations in interest rates on 4290000 of variable rate mortgage notes payable and 267800000 of variable rate bank debt out of our portfolio of real estate of 3120000000 

  

fluctuation in the interest rate environment will not affect our future earnings and cash flows on our fixed rate debt until that debt matures and must be replaced or refinanced interest rate changes will affect the fair value of the fixed rate instruments conversely changes in interest rates on variable rate debt would change our future earnings and cash flows but not affect the fair value on those instruments assuming a one percentage point increase in the interest rate related to the variable rate debt including the mortgage notes payable and the bank lines of credit and assuming no change in the outstanding balance as of year end interest expense for 2002 would increase by approximately 2721000 or 005 per common share on a diluted basis 

  

the principal amount and the average interest rates for the mortgage loans receivable and debt categorized by the final maturity dates is presented in the following table the fair value estimates for the mortgage loans receivable are based on the estimates of management and on rates currently prevailing for comparable loans the fair market value estimates for debt securities are based on discounting future cash flows utilizing current rates offered to us for debt of the same type and remaining maturity 

  

   

readers are cautioned that most of the statements contained in the “disclosures about market risk” paragraphs are forward looking and should be read in conjunction with the disclosures under the heading “cautionary language regarding forward looking statements” previously set forth

care facilities offer restorative rehabilitative and custodial nursing care for
people not requiring the more extensive and sophisticated treatment available at

are derived from providing services to residents beyond room and board and
include occupational physical speech respiratory and iv therapy wound care

care facilities provide some of the foregoing services on an outpatient basis
longterm care facilities are designed to supplement hospital care and many have
transfer agreements with one or more acute care hospitals these facilities
depend to some degree upon referrals from practicing physicians and hospitals
longterm care services are paid for either by private sources or through the
federal medicare and state medicaid programs

     longterm care facilities generally provide patients with accommodation
complete medical and nursing care and rehabilitation services including speech
physical and occupational therapy as a part of the omnibus budget
reconciliation act obra of 1981 congress established a waiver program under
medicaid to offer an alternative to institutional longterm care services the
provisions of obra and the subsequent obra acts of 1987 and 1990 allow states
with federal approval greater flexibility in program design as a means of
developing costeffective alternatives to delivering services traditionally
provided in the longterm care setting this is a contributing factor to the
recent increase in the number of assisted living facilities which may adversely
affect some longterm care facilities as some individuals choose the residential
environment and lower cost delivery system provided in the assisted living
setting

     acute care hospitals we have an interest in 18 general acute care
     
hospitals and three longterm acute care hospitals acute care hospitals offer a
wide range of services such as fullyequipped operating and recovery rooms
obstetrics radiology intensive care open heart surgery and coronary care
neurosurgery neonatal intensive care magnetic resonance imaging nursing
units oncology clinical laboratories respiratory therapy physical therapy
nuclear medicine rehabilitation services and outpatient services

     longterm acute care hospitals provide care for patients with complex
medical conditions that require more intensive care monitoring or emergency
backup than that available in most skilled nursingbased subacute programs
most longterm acute care hospital patients have severe chronic health problems
and are medically unstable or at risk of medical instability the most common
cases treated in this setting include high acuity ventilatordependent patients
and patients with multiple system failures relating to cancer spinal cord
injuries or head injuries

     services are paid for by private sources third party payors eg
insurance and hmos or through the federal medicare and state medicaid
programs medicare provides reimbursement incentives to traditional general
acute care hospitals to minimize inpatient length of stay

     rehabilitation hospitals we have investments in nine rehabilitation
     
hospitals these hospitals provide inpatient and outpatient care for patients
who have sustained traumatic injuries or illnesses such as spinal cord
injuries strokes head injuries orthopedic problems work related disabilities
and neurological diseases as well as treatment for amputees and patients with
severe arthritis rehabilitation programs encompass physical occupational
speech and inhalation therapies rehabilitative nursing and other specialties
services are paid for by the patient or the patients family third party payors

     our properties are subject to competition from the properties of other
health care providers certain of these other operators have capital resources
substantially in excess of some of the operators of our facilities in addition
the extent to which the properties are utilized depends upon several factors
including the number of physicians using the health care facilities or referring
patients there competitive systems of health care delivery and the size and
composition of the population in the surrounding area private federal and
state payment programs and the effect of other laws and regulations may also
have a significant influence on the utilization of the properties virtually all
of the properties operate in a competitive environment and patients and referral
sources including physicians may change their preferences for a health care
facility from time to time

troubled longterm care and assisted living operators

     we derive 27 of our revenue from the longterm care industry a slowing
economy with lower labor costs greater availability of nursing aides less
labor turnover and lower interest costs is expected to continue to improve
nursing home operations tempered in part by increased liability insurance costs
and lower increases or decreases in government reimbursement while certain
longterm care operators and facilities continue to experience operating
problems in part due to low levels of medicaid reimbursements in certain states
many others have shown improvement however if the most recent medicare
reimbursement increase is not extended beyond october 1 2002 and various states
institute medicaid rate cuts to reduce budget shortfalls some operators may
again begin feeling the strain of inadequate reimbursement several longterm
care facility operators including kindred and genesis health ventures two of
our lessees have successfully emerged from bankruptcy proceedings in addition
two other large longterm care operators and lessees sun healthcare which has
recently received approval for its reorganization plan and mariner healthcare
which has submitted its plan for reorganization may exit bankruptcy during the
first half of 2002

     we own eleven longterm care facilities in oklahoma four facilities in
north carolina and eight facilities in various other states whose operations
have been negatively affected by reduced reimbursement and the performance and
financial situation of the properties and their lessees we recorded revenue of
approximately 1400000 less in the fourth quarter of this year from these 23
properties than in the corresponding quarter in 2000 management expects
improved results from higher lease revenue or sales of these properties in the
next 12 months we recently signed leases for six of these facilities and
letters of intent on another three properties

     the assisted living industry from which we derive 15 of our revenue has
been challenged by overbuilding in certain areas slower than projected fillup
rates margin pressure from lower than projected rents and shortage of capital
development activity has slowed and there is improving census in a number of
communities various assisted living companies continue their efforts to
restructure their capital debt and lease structures while new operators are
emerging in the market with new capital for selective investment

     we own seven assisted living facilities currently leased to three operators
whose operations have been negatively affected by their current market position
this has resulted in our recording revenue of approximately 700000 less in the
fourth quarter of this year from these seven properties than in the same quarter
in 2000 management believes that there will be a significant improvement in its
return on some of these buildings in 2002

     we cannot assure you that the bankruptcies of certain longterm care
operators and the trouble experienced by assisted living operators will not have
a material adverse effect on our net income ffo or the market value of our
common stock

leases and loans

     the initial base rental rates of the triple net leases of properties we
acquired during the three years ended december 31 2001 have generally ranged
from 9 to 12 per annum of the acquisition price of the related property
initial interest rates on the loans we entered into during the three years ended
december 31 2001 have generally ranged from 8 to 11 per annum rental rates
vary by lease taking into consideration many factors such as

      creditworthiness of the lessee
      operating performance of the facility
      interest rates at the beginning of the lease
      location type and physical condition of the facility

     certain leases provide for additional rents that are based upon a
percentage of increased revenue over specific base period revenue of the leased
properties others have rent increases based on inflation indices or other
factors and some leases and loans have annual fixed rent or interest rate
increases see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements in this annual
report on form 10k

     in addition to the minimum and additional rents each lessee under a triple
net lease is responsible for all additional charges including charges related
to nonpayment or late payment of rent taxes and assessments governmental
charges and utility and other charges each triple net


                                       11

lessee is required at its expense to maintain its leased property in good
order and repair we are not required to repair rebuild or maintain the
properties leased under triple net leases

     each lessee with a gross or modified gross lease is also responsible for
minimum and additional rents but may not be responsible for all operating
expenses under gross or modified gross leases we may be responsible for
property taxes repairs and maintenance andor insurance on those properties

     the primary or fixed terms of the triple net and modified gross leases
generally range from ten to 15 years and generally have one or more fiveyear
or longer renewal options the average remaining base leaseterm on the triple
net and modified gross leases is approximately seven years the primary term of
the gross leases to multiple tenants in the medical office buildings range from
one to 20 years with an average of six years remaining on those leases
obligations under the triplenet leases in most cases have corporate parent or
shareholder guarantees irrevocable letters of credit from various financial
institutions and lease deposits back 142 leases and loans on 15 facilities which
cover from one to 18 months of lease or loan payments we require the lessees
and mortgagors to renew such letters of credit during the lease or loan term in
amounts that may change based upon the passage of time improved operating cash
flows or improved credit ratings

     we believe that the credit enhancements discussed above provide us with
significant protection for our investment portfolio as of january 31 2002
other than approximately 54 million in delinquent rents and interest of which
approximately 11 million is covered by credit enhancements we are currently
receiving rents and interest in a timely manner from substantially all lessees
and mortgagors as provided under the terms of the leases or loans we have
provided reserves of 34 million against the remaining amounts

     based upon information provided to us by lessees or mortgagors certain
facilities are presently underperforming financially individual facilities may
underperform as a result of inadequate medicaid reimbursement low occupancy
less than optimal patient mix excessive operating costs other operational
issues or capital needs we believe that even if these facilities remain at
current levels of performance the lease and loan provisions contain sufficient
security to assure that material rental and mortgage obligations will continue
to be met for the remainder of the lease or loan terms in the future it is
expected that some lessees may choose not to renew their leases on certain
properties at existing rental rates see table below

     many lessees have the right of first refusal to purchase the properties
during the lease term many leases provide one or more fiveyear or longer
renewal options at existing lease rates and continuing additional rent formulas
although certain leases provide for lease renewals at fair market value certain
lessees also have options to purchase the properties generally for fair market
value and generally at the expiration of the primary lease term andor any
renewal term under the lease if options are exercised many such provisions
require lessees to purchase or renew several facilities together precluding the
possibility of lessees purchasing or renewing only those facilities with the
best financial outcomes sixty one properties are not subject to purchase
options until 2008 or later and an additional 292 leased properties do not have
any purchase options

2  this column includes the revenue impact by year and the total annualized
     rental and interest income associated with properties subject to purchase
     options if a purchase option is exercisable at more than one date the
     convention used in the table is to show the revenue subject to the purchase
     option at the date management estimates is most likely for exercise of the
     option although certain purchase option periods commenced in earlier
     years lessees have not exercised their purchase options as of this time
     the total for this column 2 143921 is a component subset of column

3  seven hospitals leased to tenet healthcare corporation come up for renewal
     or purchase option in 2004 six of these leases were renewed in 1999 for a
     five year term based on the current operations at these facilities and the
     availability of contractual renewal rates below market management of hcpi
     expects that renewal of the leases in 2004 for another five year term is
     likely

4  based on current market conditions we estimate that there could be a
     revenue loss compared to current rental rates upon the expiration of the
     current term of the leases in the percentages and amounts shown in the
     table for lease expirations the percentages are computed by taking the
     possible revenue loss as a percentage of 2001 total annualized revenue

5  we estimate that in addition to the possible reduction in income from lease
     expirations we may also have an increase of approximately 700000 in 2002
     due to the reinvestment of cash received from mortgage maturities and
     facility sales this amount is calculated based on current interest rate
     levels and is not estimated in years subsequent to 2002 due to the
     unpredictable levels of facility sales and interest rates and their impact
     on sales and mortgage maturities

     there are numerous factors that could have an impact on lease renewals or
facility sales including the financial strength of the lessee expected
facility operating performance the relative level of interest rates and
individual lessee financing options based upon management expectations of our
continued growth the facilities subject to renewal andor sale and mortgage
maturities and any possible rent loss therefrom should represent a small
percentage of revenue in the year of renewal or purchase

     each lessee at its expense may make noncapital additions modifications

our or our affiliates property upon termination of the lease leases generally
require the lessee to maintain adequate insurance on the leased property naming
us or our affiliates and any mortgagees as additional insureds in certain
circumstances the lessee may selfinsure pursuant to a prudent program of
selfinsurance if the lessee or the guarantor of

its lease obligations has substantial net worth in addition each lease
requires the lessee to indemnify us or our affiliates against certain
liabilities in connection with the leased property

development of facilities

     since 1987 we have committed to the development of 61 facilities as of
december 31 2001 we have funded costs of approximately 418 million and have
completed 58 facilities of our total development commitment the completed
facilities comprise

      35 congregate care and assisted living facilities
      seven longterm care facilities
      seven medical office buildings
      five rehabilitation hospitals
      four acute care hospitals

     simultaneously with the commencement of each of these development programs
and prior to funding we enter into a lease agreement with the
developeroperator the base rent under the lease is generally established at a
rate equivalent to a specified margin over our cost of money at the commencement
of the lease

     our build to suit development program generally includes a variety of
additional forms of credit enhancement and collateral beyond those provided by
the leases during the development period we generally require additional
security and collateral in the form of more than one of the following

      irrevocable letters of credit from financial institutions
      payment and performance bonds and
      completion guarantees by either one or a combination of the
       developeroperators parent entity other affiliates or one or more of
       the individual principals who control the developeroperator

     in addition before we advance any funds under the development agreement
the developeroperator must provide

      satisfactory evidence in the form of an endorsement to our title
       insurance policy that no intervening liens have been placed on the
       property since the date of our previous advance
      a certificate executed by the project architect that indicates that all
       construction work completed on the project conforms with the requirements
       of the applicable plans and specifications
      a certificate executed by the general contractor that all work requested
       for reimbursement has been completed and
      satisfactory evidence that the funds remaining unadvanced are sufficient
       for the payment of all costs necessary for the completion of the project
       in accordance with the terms and provisions of the agreement

     as a further safeguard during the development period we generally will
retain 10 of construction funds incurred until we have received satisfactory
evidence that the project will be fully


                                       14

completed in accordance with the applicable plans and specifications we also
monitor the progress of the development of each project and the accuracy of the
developeroperators draw requests by having our own inhouse inspector perform
regular onsite inspections of the project prior to the release of any requested
funds

investments in consolidated and nonconsolidated joint ventures

     at december 31 2001 we also had varying percentage interests in several
limited liability companies and partnerships that together own 72 facilities and
two mortgages as further discussed below

future acquisitions

     we anticipate acquiring additional health care related facilities and
leasing them to health care operators or investing in mortgages secured by
health care facilities

taxation of hcpi

     we believe that we have operated in such a manner as to qualify for
taxation as a reit under sections 856 to 860 of the internal revenue code of
1986 as amended the code commencing with our taxable year ended december
31 1985 and we intend to continue to operate in such a manner no assurance
can be given that we have operated or will be able to continue to operate in a
manner so as to qualify or to remain so qualified this summary is qualified in
its entirety by the applicable code provisions rules and regulations
promulgated thereunder and administrative and judicial interpretations thereof

     if we qualify for taxation as a reit we will generally not be required to
pay federal corporate income taxes on the portion of our net income that is
currently distributed to stockholders this


                                       15

page

treatment substantially eliminates the double taxation ie at the corporate
and stockholder levels that generally results from investment in a corporation
however we will be required to pay federal income tax under certain
circumstances

     the code defines a reit as a corporation trust or association i which is
managed by one or more trustees or directors ii the beneficial ownership of
which is evidenced by transferable shares or by transferable certificates of
beneficial interest iii which would be taxable but for sections 856 through
860 of the code as a domestic corporation iv which is neither a financial
institution nor an insurance company subject to certain provisions of the code
v the beneficial ownership of which is held by 100 or more persons vi
during the last half of each taxable year not more than 50 in value of the
outstanding stock of which is owned actually or constructively by five or
fewer individuals and vii which meets certain other tests described below
regarding the amount of its distributions and the nature of its income and
assets the code provides that conditions i to iv inclusive must be met
during the entire taxable year and that condition v must be met during at
least 335 days of a taxable year of 12 months or during a proportionate part of
a taxable year of less than 12 months

     there presently are two gross income requirements first at least 75 of
our gross income excluding gross income from prohibited transactions as
defined below for each taxable year must be derived directly or indirectly from
investments relating to real property or mortgages on real property or from
certain types of temporary investment income second at least 95 of our gross
income excluding gross income from prohibited transactions for each taxable
year must be derived from income that qualifies under the 75 test and all other
dividends interest and gain from the sale or other disposition of stock or
securities a prohibited transaction is a sale or other disposition of
property other than foreclosure property held for sale to customers in the
ordinary course of business

     at the close of each quarter of our taxable year we must also satisfy four
tests relating to the nature of our assets first at least 75 of the value of
our total assets must be represented by real estate assets including stock or
debt instruments held for not more than one year purchased with the proceeds of
a stock offering or longterm more than five years public debt offering by
us cash cash items and government securities second not more than 25 of
our total assets may be represented by securities other than those in the 75
asset class third of the investments included in the 25 asset class the
value of any one issuers securities owned by us may not exceed 5 of the value
of our total assets and we may not own more than 10 of the vote or value of the
securities of a nonreit corporation other than certain debt securities and
interests in taxable reit subsidiaries as defined below fourth not more than
20 of the value of our total assets may be represented by securities of one or
more taxable reit subsidiaries

     the first three asset tests mentioned above were applicable for all of our
prior taxable years except for the 10 value requirement relating to the
securities of a nonreit corporation this provision and the fourth asset test
which limits our ownership of taxable reit subsidiaries are effective for
taxable years ending after december 31 2000

     we own interests in various partnerships and limited liability companies
in the case of a reit that is a partner in a partnership or a member of a
limited liability company that is treated as a partnership under the code
treasury regulations provide that for purposes of the reit income and asset
tests the reit will be deemed to own its proportionate share of the assets of
the partnership or limited liability company and will be deemed to be entitled
to the income of the partnership or limited liability company attributable to
such share the ownership of an interest in a partnership or limited


                                       16

page


liability company by a reit may involve special tax risks including the
challenge by the internal revenue service the service of the allocations of
income and expense items of the partnership or limited liability company which
would affect the computation of taxable income of the reit and the status of
the partnership or limited liability company as a partnership as opposed to an
association taxable as a corporation for federal income tax purposes we also
own interests in a number of subsidiaries which are intended to be treated as
qualified reit subsidiaries each a qrs the code provides that such
subsidiaries will be ignored for federal income tax purposes and all assets
liabilities and items of income deduction and credit of such subsidiaries will
be treated as assets liabilities and such items of ours if any partnership
limited liability company or subsidiary in which we own an interest were
treated as a regular corporation and not as a partnership qrs or taxable reit
subsidiary for federal income tax purposes we would likely fail to satisfy the
reit asset tests described above and would therefore fail to qualify as a reit
we believe that each of the partnerships limited liability companies and
subsidiaries other than taxable reit subsidiaries in which we own an interest
will be treated for tax purposes as a partnership or disregarded entity in the
case of a partnership or limited liability company or qrs respectively
although no assurance can be given that the service will not successfully
challenge the status of any such organization

     we also own interests in two subsidiaries which are intended to be treated
as taxable reit subsidiaries each a trs a reit may own any percentage of
the voting stock and value of the securities of a corporation which jointly
elects with the reit to be a trs provided certain requirements are met a trs
generally may engage in any business including the provision of customary or
noncustomary services to tenants of its parent reit and of others except a trs
may not manage or operate a health care facility a trs is treated as a regular
corporation and is subject to federal income tax and applicable state income and
franchise taxes at regular corporate rates in addition a 100 tax may be
imposed on a reit if its rental service or other agreements with its trs or
the trss agreements with the reits tenants are not on arms length terms

     in order to qualify as a reit we are required to distribute dividends
other than capital gain dividends to our stockholders in an amount at least
equal to a the sum of i 90 of our real estate investment trust taxable
income computed without regard to the dividends paid deduction and our net
capital gain and ii 90 of the net income if any after tax from
foreclosure property minus b the sum of certain items of noncash income for
all of our taxable years beginning before january 1 2001 the 90 distribution
requirement discussed above was 95 such distributions must be paid in the
taxable year to which they relate or in the following taxable year if declared
before we timely file our tax return for such year if paid on or before the
first regular dividend payment date after such declaration and if we so elect
and specify the dollar amount in our tax return to the extent that we do not
distribute all of our net longterm capital gain or distribute at least 90 but
less than 100 of our real estate investment trust taxable income as
adjusted we will be required to pay tax thereon at regular corporate tax rates
furthermore if we should fail to distribute during each calendar year at least
the sum of i 85 of our ordinary income for such year ii 95 of our capital
gain income for such year and iii any undistributed taxable income from prior
periods we would be required to pay a 4 excise tax on the excess of such
required distributions over the amounts actually distributed

     if we fail to qualify for taxation as a reit in any taxable year and
certain relief provisions do not apply we will be required to pay tax
including any applicable alternative minimum tax on our taxable income at
regular corporate rates distributions to stockholders in any year in which we
fail to qualify will not be deductible by us nor will they be required to be
made unless entitled to relief under specific statutory provisions we will
also be disqualified from taxation as a reit for the four


                                       17

taxable years following the year during which qualification was lost it is not
possible to state whether in all circumstances we would be entitled to the
statutory relief failure to qualify for even one year could substantially
reduce distributions to stockholders and could result in our incurring
substantial indebtedness to the extent borrowings are feasible or liquidating
substantial investments in order to pay the resulting taxes

     on november 4 1999 we acquired ahe in a merger ahe had also made an
election to be taxed as a reit if ahe failed to qualify as a reit for any of
its taxable years it would be subject to federal income tax including any
applicable alternative minimum tax on its taxable income at regular corporate
rates as successorininterest to ahe we would be required to pay this tax in
addition in connection with the merger and to the extent that the merger is
treated as a reorganization under the code we succeeded to various tax
attributes of ahe including any undistributed c corporation earnings and
profits of ahe a c corporation is generally defined as a corporation which is
required to pay a full corporatelevel tax if ahe qualified as a reit for all
years prior to the merger and the merger is treated as a reorganization under
the code then ahe would not have any undistributed c corporation earnings and
profits if however ahe failed to qualify as a reit for any year then it is
possible that we acquired undistributed c corporation earnings and profits from
ahe if we did not distribute these c corporation earnings and profits prior to
the end of 1999 we would fail to qualify as a reit ahes counsel rendered
opinions in connection with the merger to the effect that based on the facts
representations and assumptions stated therein commencing with its taxable year
ended december 31 1987 ahe was organized in conformity with the requirements
for qualification and taxation as a reit under the code and its method of
operation enabled it to meet through the effective time of the merger the
requirements for qualification and taxation as a reit under the code

     we and our stockholders may be required to pay state or local tax in
various state or local jurisdictions including those in which we or they
transact business or reside the state and local tax treatment of us and our
stockholders may not conform to the federal income tax consequences discussed
above

government regulation

     the health care industry is heavily regulated by federal state and local
laws this government regulation of the health care industry affects us because

1  the financial ability of lessees to make rent and debt payments to us may
     be affected by governmental regulations such as licensure certification
     for participation in government programs and government reimbursement and
2  our additional rents are often based on our lessees gross revenue from
     operations in many instances which in turn are affected by the amount of
     reimbursement such lessees receive from the government

     these laws and regulations are subject to frequent and substantial changes
resulting from legislation adoption of rules and regulations and
administrative and judicial interpretations of existing law these changes may
have a dramatic effect on the definition of permissible or impermissible
activities the relative costs associated with doing business and the amount of
reimbursement by both government and other thirdparty payors these changes may
be applied retroactively the ultimate timing or effect of these changes cannot
be predicted the failure of any borrower of funds from us or lessee of any of
our properties to comply with such laws requirements


                                       18

page


and regulations could affect its ability to operate its facility or facilities
and could adversely affect such borrowers or lessees ability to make debt or
lease payments to us

     fraud and abuse there are various federal and state laws prohibiting fraud
by health care providers including criminal provisions which prohibit filing
false claims or making false statements to receive payment or certification
under medicare and medicaid or failing to refund overpayments or improper
payments violation of these federal provisions is a felony punishable by up to
five years imprisonment andor a 25000 fine civil provisions prohibit the
knowing filing of a false claim or the knowing use of false statements to obtain
payment the penalties for such violations may include fines ranging from 5000
to 10000 plus treble damages for each claim filed

     there are also laws that attempt to eliminate fraud and abuse by
prohibiting payment arrangements that include compensation for patient
referrals the federal antikickback law prohibits among other things the
offer payment solicitation or receipt of any form of remuneration in return
for or to induce the referral of medicare medicaid or other federal health
care program patients a wide array of relationships and arrangements including
ownership interests in a company by persons who refer or who are in a position
to refer patients as well as personal services agreements have under certain
circumstances been alleged or been found to violate these provisions in
addition to the antikickback statute federal law also restricts physicians who
have financial relationships with hospitals and other providers of health care
services from making referrals for certain services to those providers in
august 1995 the federal government released final regulations addressing
physician referral prohibitions relating to financial relationships with
entities that furnish clinical laboratory services in january 2001 the federal
government released the first portion of final regulations that explain the
scope of the physician referral prohibition with respect to entities that
furnish certain designated health services most of the provisions contained
within the january 2001 regulations became effective january 4 2002 the second
part of the final regulations has not been promulgated and is not expected until
2002 or later all of these regulations will impact health care providers
financial and contractual arrangements with physicians

     many states have adopted or are considering legislative proposals similar
to the federal antikickback statute some of which apply to the referral of
patients for health care services reimbursed by any source not only the
medicare and other federal government programs in addition several states have
enacted or are considering legislation that prohibits physician referral
arrangements or requires physicians to disclose any financial interest they may
have with a health care provider to their patients when referring patients to
that provider the federal and state laws and regulations regarding fraud and
abuse are extremely complex and little judicial or regulatory interpretation
exists

     state and federal governments are devoting increasing attention and
resources to antifraud initiatives against health care providers the health
insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 and the balanced budget act
of 1997 expand the penalties for health care fraud including broader provisions
for the exclusion of providers from the medicare and medicaid programs further
under operation restore trust a major antifraud demonstration project the
office of inspector general of the us department of health and human services
in cooperation with other federal and state agencies has focused on the
activities of skilled nursing facilities home health agencies hospices and
durable medical equipment suppliers in certain states including california in
which we have properties due to the success of operation restore trust the
project has been expanded to numerous other states and to additional providers
including providers of ancillary nursing home services


                                       19

     another trend affecting the health care industry is the increased use of
the federal false claims act and in particular actions under the false claims
acts whistleblower provisions those provisions allow a private individual to
bring actions on behalf of the government alleging that the defendant has
defrauded the federal government recently the number of suits brought against
health care providers by private individuals has increased in addition various
states are considering or have enacted laws modeled after the federal false
claims act even in instances when a whistleblower action is dismissed with no
judgment or settlement the lessee may incur substantial legal fees and other
costs relating to an investigation certain lessees have been faced with
whistleblower suits by former employees alleging noncompliance with medicare
rules and regulations for instance the us department of justice recently
joined a whistleblower suit filed against integrated health services inc
which alleges that the company admitted and retained patients in its longterm
care hospitals who did not require acute care and billed medicare for these
allegedly unnecessary services

     some medicare fiscal intermediaries private companies that contract with
the centers for medicare and medicaid services cms formerly the health care
financing administration to administer the medicare program have also
increased scrutiny of cost reports filed by longterm care providers findings
of violations of the fraud and abuse laws and regulations may jeopardize a
borrowers or lessees ability to operate a facility or to make rent and debt
payments thereby potentially adversely affecting us our lease arrangements
with lessees may also be subject to these fraud and abuse laws federal and
state laws governing illegal rebates and kickbacks regulate contingent or
percentage rent arrangements where our coinvestors are physicians or others in
a position to refer patients to the facilities although only limited
interpretive or enforcement guidance is available we have structured our rent
arrangements in a manner that we believe complies with such laws and
regulations

     we have no knowledge regarding any facilities in which we have an
investment that would lead us to believe that the facilities in which we have
investments are not in substantial compliance with the various regulatory
requirements applicable to them although there can be no assurance that the
operators are in compliance or will remain in compliance in the future

     licensure risks most health care facilities must obtain a license to
operate failure to obtain licensure or loss of licensure would prevent a
facility from operating these events could adversely affect the facility
operators ability to make rent and debt payments state and local laws also may
regulate expansion including the addition of new beds or services or
acquisition of medical equipment and occasionally the contraction of health
care facilities by requiring certificate of need or other similar approval
programs in addition health care facilities are subject to the americans with
disabilities act and building and safety codes which govern access to and
physical design requirements and building standards for facilities

     environmental matters a wide variety of federal state and local
environmental and occupational health and safety laws and regulations affect
health care facility operations under various federal state and local
environmental laws ordinances and regulations an owner of real property or a
secured lender such as us may be liable for the costs of removal or
remediation of hazardous or toxic substances at under or disposed of in
connection with such property as well as other potential costs relating to
hazardous or toxic substances including government fines and damages for
injuries to persons and adjacent property such laws often impose such
liability without regard to whether the owner or secured lender knew of or was
responsible for the presence or disposal of such substances and may be imposed
on the owner or secured lender in connection with


                                       20

page


the activities of an operator of the property the cost of any required
remediation removal fines or personal or property damages and the owners or
secured lenders liability therefore could exceed the value of the property
andor the assets of the owner or secured lender in addition the presence of
such substances or the failure to properly dispose of or remediate such
substances may adversely affect the owners ability to sell or rent such
property or to borrow using such property as collateral which in turn would
reduce our revenue

     although the mortgage loans that we provide and leases covering our
properties require the borrower and the lessee to indemnify us for certain
environmental liabilities the scope of such obligations may be limited and we
cannot assure that any such borrower or lessee would be able to fulfill its
indemnification obligations

     medicare and medicaid programs sources of revenue for lessees and
mortgagors may include the federal medicare program state medicaid programs
private insurance carriers health care service plans and health maintenance
organizations among others efforts to reduce costs by these payors will likely
continue which may result in reduced or slower growth in reimbursement for
certain services provided by some of our operators in addition the failure of
any of our operators to comply with various laws and regulations could
jeopardize their ability to continue participating in the medicare and medicaid
programs

     medicare payments to acute care hospitals for inpatient services are based
on the prospective payment system under the prospective payment system a
hospital is paid a prospectively established rate based on the category of the
patients diagnosis diagnostic related groups or drgs beginning in 1991
medicare payments began to phasein the prospective payment system for capital
related inpatient costs over a ten year period thus current medicare
reimbursement to hospitals for capitalrelated inpatient costs is based on a
federal prospective rate rather than the costbased reimbursement system
previously used drg rates are subject to adjustment on an annual basis as part
of the federal budget reconciliation process the balanced budget act of 1997
expanded the prospective payment system to include skilled nursing facilities
home health agencies hospital outpatient departments and rehabilitation
hospitals see health care reform section and further discussion following

     beginning in august 2000 cms implemented a prospective payment system
under which services and items furnished in hospital outpatient departments are
reimbursed using a predetermined amount for each ambulatory payment
classification or apc each medicare outpatient apc is based on the specific
procedures performed and items furnished during a patient visit certain items
and services are paid on a fee schedule and for certain drugs biologies and
technologies hospitals are reimbursed additional amounts apc rates are subject
to adjustment on an annual basis

     medicaid programs generally pay for acute and rehabilitative care based on
reasonable costs at fixed rates longterm care facilities are generally
reimbursed using fixed daily rates medicaid payments are generally below retail
rates for lesseeoperated facilities increasingly states have introduced
managed care contracting techniques in the administration of medicaid programs
such mechanisms could have the impact of reducing utilization of and
reimbursement to lesseeoperated facilities

     third party payors in various states and areas base payments on costs
retail rates or increasingly negotiated rates negotiated rates can include
discounts from normal charges fixed daily rates and prepaid capitated rates


                                       21

     skilled nursing facility prospective payment system most state medicaid
programs and up until july 1 1998 medicare programs utilized a costbased
reimbursement system for skilled nursing facilities which reimbursed these
facilities for the reasonable direct and indirect allowable costs incurred in
providing routine services plus in certain states a return on equity subject
to certain cost ceilings these costs normally included allowances for
administrative and general costs as well as the costs of property and equipment
depreciation and interest fair rental allowance or rental expense costbased
reimbursement was typically subject to retrospective adjustment through cost
report settlement and for certain states payments made to a facility on an
interim basis that were subsequently determined to be less than or in excess of
allowable costs could be adjusted through future payments to the affected
facility state medicaid reimbursement programs varied as to the methodology
used to determine the level of allowable costs which were reimbursed to
operators

     beginning on july 1 1998 the congressionally mandated prospective payment
system was implemented for skilled nursing facilities under the prospective
payment system skilled nursing facilities are paid a casemix adjusted federal
per diem rate for medicarecovered services provided by the skilled nursing
facilities the per diem rate is calculated to cover routine service costs
ancillary costs and most capitalrelated costs see further discussion under
health care reform


     longterm care facilities and regulatory issues longterm care facilities
are regulated primarily through the licensing of such facilities against a
common background established by federal law enacted as part of the omnibus
budget reconciliation act of 1987 regulatory authorities and licensing
standards vary from state to state and in some instances from locality to
locality these standards are constantly reviewed and revised state agencies
periodically inspect facilities to determine whether they comply with state
andor federal regulations at which time deficiencies may be identified the
facilities must correct these deficiencies as a condition to continued licensing
or certification and participation in government reimbursement programs
depending on the nature of such deficiencies remedies can be routine or costly
similarly compliance with regulations which cover a broad range of areas such
as patients rights staff training quality of life and quality of resident
care may increase facility startup and operating costs

     in 1999 and 2000 congress increased funding for state health agencies in
order to allow state agencies that conduct skilled nursing facility inspections
to intensify medicare and medicaid regulatory enforcement efforts cms has
instructed these state agencies to increase the number of unannounced nursing
home inspections and to investigate consumer complaints about skilled nursing
facilities promptly as a result of these increased enforcement efforts some of
our lessees may be subject to fines and other penalties that could increase
their operating costs

     acute care hospitals acute care hospitals are also subject to extensive
federal state and local regulation acute care hospitals undergo periodic
inspections regarding standards of medical care equipment and hygiene as a
condition of licensure various licenses and permits also are required for
purchasing and administering narcotics operating laboratories and pharmacies
and the use of radioactive materials and certain equipment each of our
facilities the operation of which requires accreditation is accredited by the
joint commission on accreditation of healthcare organizations such
accreditation may be a more costeffective and timeefficient method of meeting
requirements for continued licensing and for participation in government
sponsored provider programs


                                       22

     acute care hospitals must comply with requirements for various forms of
utilization review in addition under the prospective payment system each
state must have a peer review organization also known as a quality improvement
organization carry out federally funded mandated reviews of medicare patient
admissions treatment and discharges in acute care hospitals

     congregate care and assisted living facilities certain congregate care and
assisted living facilities are subject to federal state and local licensure
certification and inspection laws these laws regulate among other matters the
number of licensed beds the provision of services equipment staffing and
operating policies and procedures failure to comply with these laws and
regulations could result in the denial of reimbursement in a few states and
decertification from the medicaid program the imposition of fines suspension
or and in extreme cases the revocation of a facilitys license or closure of a
facility such actions may have an effect on the revenue of the operators of
properties owned by or mortgaged to us and therefore adversely impact us

     physician group practice clinics physician group practice clinics are
subject to extensive federal state and local legislation and regulation every
state imposes licensing requirements on individual physicians and on facilities
and services operated by physicians in addition federal and state laws
regulate health maintenance organizations and other managed care organizations
with which physician groups may have contracts many states require regulatory
approval including certificates of need before establishing certain types of
physiciandirected clinics offering certain services or making expenditures in
excess of statutory thresholds for health care equipment facilities or
programs in connection with the expansion of existing operations and the entry
into new markets physician clinics and affiliated practice groups may become
subject to compliance with additional regulation

     rehabilitation hospitals rehabilitation hospitals are subject to extensive
federal state and local legislation regulation inspection and licensure
requirements similar to those of acute care hospitals many states have adopted
a patients bill of rights which provides for certain higher standards for
patient care that are designed to decrease restrictions and enhance dignity in

     the health care industry has continually faced various challenges
including increased government and private payor pressure on health care
providers to control costs the migration of patients from acute care facilities
into extended care and home care settings and the vertical and horizontal
consolidation of health care providers the pressure to control health care
costs intensified during 1994 and 1995 as a result of the national health care
reform debate and continued as congress attempted to slow the rate of growth of
federal health care expenditures as part of its effort to balance the federal
budget

     changes in the law new interpretations of existing laws and changes in
payment methodology may have a dramatic effect on the definition of permissible
or impermissible activities the relative costs associated with doing business
and the amount of reimbursement furnished by both government and other
thirdparty payors these changes may be applied retroactively under certain
circumstances the ultimate timing or effect of legislative efforts cannot be
predicted and may impact us in different ways

     these changes include


                                       23

      the adoption of the medicarechoice program which expands medicare
       beneficiaries choices to include traditional medicare feeforservice
       private feeforservice medical savings accounts various managed care
       plans and provider sponsored organizations among others
      the expansion and restriction of reimbursement for various medicare
       benefits
      the adoption of a prospective payment system for skilled nursing
       facilities home health agencies hospital outpatient departments and
       rehabilitation hospitals
      the repeal of the boren amendment payment standard for medicaid so that
       states have the exclusive authority to determine provider rates and
       providers have no federal right of action
      the reduction in medicare disproportionate share payments to hospitals
       and
      the removal of the 150000000 limit on taxexempt bonds for nonacute
       hospital capital projects

     the balanced budget act of 1997 signed by president clinton on august 5
1997 was designed to produce several billion dollars in net savings for
medicaid over the five years following enactment in addition the balanced
budget act repealed the boren amendment under which states were required to pay
longterm care providers including skilled nursing facilities rates that were
reasonable and adequate to meet the cost which must be incurred by efficiently
and economically operated facilities as a result of the repeal of the boren
amendment states are now required by the balanced budget act to do the
following with respect to skilled nursing facility rates

      use a public process for determining rates
      publish proposed and final rates the methodologies underlying the rates
       and justifications for the rates and
      give methodologies and justifications

     when determining rates states are required to take into account the
situation of skilled nursing facilities that serve a disproportionate number of
lowincome patients with special needs the secretary of health and human
services is required to conduct a study concerning the effect of state
ratesetting methodologies on the access to and the quality of services provided
to medicaid beneficiaries and report the study results to congress the balanced
budget act also provides the federal government with expanded enforcement powers
to combat waste fraud and abuse in delivery of health care services though
applicable to payments for services furnished on or after october 1 1997 the
new requirements are not retroactive thus states that have not proposed
changes in their payment methods or standards or changes in rates for items and
services furnished on or after october 1 1997 need not immediately implement a
balanced budget act public approval process the balanced budget act of 1997
also strengthened the antifraud and abuse laws to provide for stiffer penalties
for fraud and abuse violations

     the balanced budget act also reduced the payments made to longterm acute
care hospitals ltacs regarding ltacs the balanced budget act reduced the
amount of reimbursement for incentive payments established pursuant to the tax
equity and fiscal responsibility act of 1982 tefra for capital expenditures
and bad debts and for services to certain patients transferred from an acute
care hospital in addition the balanced budget act for the first time imposed a
national ceiling limitation or national cap on payments that may be made in
each category of hospitals exempt from a prospective payment system ltacs
constitute one such category the reduction in payments to ltacs mandated by the
budget act many adversely effect an ltac operators ability to develop or
acquire ltacs in the future


                                       24

     ltacs currently excluded from a prospective payment system are scheduled
to transition to a prospective payment system by october 1 2002 a prospective
payment system for ltacs is mandated under the balanced budget act the benefits
improvement act directs the secretary of the us department of health and human
services to study the question of whether to base the eventual prospective
payment system for ltacs on existing diagnosisrelated groups which are now
used for inpatient stays in acute care hospitals or on refined diagnosis
related groups to date the secretary has not proposed a prospective payment
system for ltacs if the secretary cannot implement a prospective payment system
specific to ltacs by october 1 2002 the secretary is required to instead
implement a prospective payment system based upon existing acute care hospital
diagnosisrelated groups that have been modified where possible to account for
resource usage of ltac patients

     in november 1999 president clinton signed into law the medicare medicaid
and schip balanced budget refinement act of 1999 budget refinement act which
reduces some of the reimbursement cutbacks enacted under the balanced budget
act the budget refinement act delayed implementation of costcutting measures
and increased payments to some sectors of the health care industry longterm
care facilities received increased payments under the budget refinement act
disproportionate share hospital payment cutbacks were lessened the budget
refinement act provided that the change to a prospective payment system for
outpatient hospital services must be budget neutral and not result in reduced
reimbursement the extent of the financial relief provided by the budget
refinement act is estimated to be 16 billion over five years

     continuing this trend president clinton signed the medicare medicaid and
schip benefits improvement and protection act of 2000 benefits improvement
act in december 2000 which provides for acrosstheboard medicare and
medicaid payment increases for most health care providers overall passage of
the benefits improvement act is expected to result in approximately 35 billion
in additional reimbursement for providers over the next five years
additionally the benefits improvement act extended the moratorium on
implementation of the cap for outpatient therapy services throughout 2002
payments for home health services hospice services and longterm care hospital
services will also increase under the provisions of the benefits improvement
act

     a number of the budget refinement act and the benefits improvement act
provisions that provide reimbursement relief to skilled nursing facilities are
set to expire on september 30 2002 it has been estimated that the skilled
nursing facility sector will experience a 17 rate drop when these provisions
expire in fiscal year 2003 various industry organizations are examining ways to
ameliorate the potentially adverse effects of such a medicare rate drop

     other federal initiatives will result in greater operational expenditures
for health care providers for instance the health insurance portability and
accountability act of 1996 requires a significant overhaul of health care
information systems to protect individual medical information and to standardize
formatting of health care claims in november 1999 the department of health and
human services released proposed regulations to protect the confidentiality of
individual health information final privacy regulations were released in
december 2000 health care providers must comply with the privacy regulations by
april 14 2003 the federal government has estimated that the united states
health care industry will spend approximately 18 billion over a tenyear period
in order to achieve compliance with these new privacy requirements

     in august 2000 the us department of health and human services also
released final regulations that delineated uniform national standards for the
electronic exchange of medical


                                       25

page


information and filing of claims health care providers must comply with these
regulations by october 16 2002 or receive a waiver from the department to
extend the deadline for compliance to october 16 2003 the federal government
estimates that compliance will cost health care providers approximately 35
billion however the federal government has predicted that implementation of
these uniform standards will help to speed conversion from manual to electronic
billing systems resulting in cost savings of approximately 30 billion over the
next decade for health care providers

     in addition to the reforms enacted and considered by congress from time to
time state legislatures periodically consider various health care reform
proposals congress and state legislatures can be expected to continue to review
and assess alternative health care delivery systems new regulatory enforcement
initiatives and new payment methodologies public debate of these issues can be
expected to continue in the future there are numerous initiatives at the
federal and state levels for comprehensive reforms affecting the payment for and
delivery of health care services changes in the law new interpretations of
existing laws and changes in payment methodology and enforcement priorities may
have a dramatic effect on the definition of permissible or impermissible
activities the relative costs associated with doing business and the amount of
reimbursement by both government and other thirdparty payors these changes may
be applied retroactively the ultimate timing or effect of legislative efforts
cannot be predicted and may impact us in different ways

     in 1998 health expenditures in the united states amounted to 11
trillion representing 135 percent of gross domestic product the centers for
medicaid and medicare services reported that 1998 spending for health care
continued a fiveyear trend of low growth to below six percent annually but
reflected the highest annual percentage increase since 1993 also for the first
time in a decade public spending grew more slowly than private health care
spending the primary reason for the slow growth in public spending was
medicare which was significantly affected by the adoption of reimbursement
restriction measures in the balanced budget act of 1997 fraud savings also
contributed because economic growth generally matched growth in health care
spending since 1993 the health care share of gross domestic product has
remained roughly the same since 1993 we believe that government and private
efforts to contain or reduce health care costs will continue these trends are
likely to lead to reduced or slower growth in reimbursement for certain services
provided by some of our lessees and mortgagors we believe that the vast nature
of the health care industry the financial strength and operating flexibility of
our operators and the diversity of our portfolio will mitigate the impact of any
such diminution in reimbursements however we cannot predict whether any of the
above proposals or any other proposals will be adopted and if adopted no
assurance can be given that the implementation of such reforms will not have a
material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations

objectives and policies

     we are organized to invest in incomeproducing health care related
facilities in evaluating potential investments we consider such factors as

      the geographic area type of property and demographic profile
      the location construction quality condition and design of the property
      the current and anticipated cash flow and its adequacy to meet
       operational needs and lease obligations
      the rent provides a competitive market return to our investors
      the potential for capital appreciation


                                       26

      the tax laws related to real estate investment trusts
      the regulatory and reimbursement environment in which the properties
       operate
      occupancy and demand for similar health facilities in the same or nearby
       communities
      an adequate mix between private and government sponsored patients at
       health facilities
      potential alternative uses of the facilities and
      prospects for liquidity through financing or refinancing

     there are no limitations on the percentage of our total assets that may be
invested in any one property or partnership the investment committee of the
board of directors may establish limitations as it deems appropriate from time
to time no limits have been set on the number of properties in which we will
seek to invest or on the concentration of investments in any one facility or
any one city or state we acquire our investments primarily for income

     at december 31 2001 we had three series of preferred stock and one class
of debt securities which are senior to the common stock we may in the future
issue additional debt or equity securities which will be senior to the common
stock we have authority to offer shares of our capital stock in exchange for
investments which conform to our standards and to repurchase or otherwise
acquire our shares or other securities

     we may incur additional indebtedness when in the opinion of our management
and directors it is advisable for shortterm purposes we from time to time
negotiate lines of credit or arrange for other shortterm borrowings from banks
or otherwise we arrange for longterm borrowings through public offerings or
from institutional investors

     in addition we may incur additional mortgage indebtedness on real estate
which we have acquired through purchase foreclosure or otherwise where
leverage is present on terms deemed favorable we invest in properties subject
to existing loans or secured by mortgages deeds of trust or similar liens on
the properties we also may obtain nonrecourse or other mortgage financing on
unleveraged properties in which we have invested or may refinance properties
acquired on a leveraged basis

     in march 2001 we introduced a new dividend reinvestment and stock purchase
plan the plan under the terms of the plan existing stockholders may
purchase shares of common stock by reinvesting all or a portion of the cash
dividends from their shares of common stock or by making optional cash payments
to purchase additional shares of common stock

     on june 20 2000 we adopted a stockholder rights plan and declared a
dividend of one preferred share purchase right for each outstanding share of our
common stock the rights will become exercisable if a person or group of
affiliated or associated persons has acquired or obtained the right to acquire
beneficial ownership of 15 or more of our common stock or following the
commencement or announcement of an intention to make a tender offer or exchange
offer the consummation of which would result in the beneficial ownership by a
person or group of 15 or more of our common stock after the rights become
exercisable each right will entitle the holder to purchase from us one
onehundredth 1100th of a share of series d junior participating preferred
stock at a price of 95 per one onehundredth 1100th of a preferred share
subject to certain antidilution adjustments the rights will at no time have
any voting rights


                                       27

page


     each series d preferred share purchasable upon exercise of the rights will
be entitled when as and if declared to a minimum preferential quarterly
dividend payment of 100 per share but will be entitled to an aggregate
dividend of 100 times the dividend if any declare per common share in the
event our liquidation dissolution or winding up the holders of the series d
preferred shares will be entitled to a preferential liquidation payment of 100
per share plus any accrued but unpaid dividends but will be entitled to an
aggregate payment of 100 times the payment made per common share each series d
preferred share will have 100 votes and will vote together with our common
stock finally in the event of any merger consolidation or other transaction
in which shares of our common stock are exchanged each series d preferred share
will be entitled to receive 100 times the amount received per share of common
stock series d preferred shares will not be redeemable the rights are
protected by customary antidilution provisions because of the nature of the
preferred shares dividend liquidation and voting rights the value of one
onehundredth of a preferred share purchasable upon exercise of each right
should approximate the value of one common share

     under certain circumstances each holder of a right other than rights that
are or were acquired or beneficially owned by a person or group acquiring 15 or
more which rights will thereafter be void will have the right to receive upon
exercise that number of common shares having a market value of two times the
then current purchase price of one right in the event that after a person
acquired 15 or more of our common stock we were acquired in a merger or other
business combination transaction or more than 50 of our assets or earning power
were sold each holder of a right shall have the right to receive upon the
exercise thereof at the then current purchase price of the right that number of
shares of common stock of the acquiring company which at the time of such
transaction would have a market value of two times the then current purchase
price of one right

     the rights may be redeemed by the board of directors at any time prior to
the time a person or group acquires 15 or more of our common stock

     the rights will expire on july 27 2010 unless earlier redeemed exchanged
or terminated the bank of new york is the rights agent

     the rights are designed to assure that all of our stockholders receive fair
and equal treatment in the event of any proposed takeover of us and to guard
against partial tender offers open market accumulations and other abusive
tactics to gain control of us without paying all stockholders a control premium
the rights will cause substantial dilution to a person or group that acquires
15 or more of our stock on terms not approved by our board of directors the
rights should not interfere with any merger or other business combination
approved by the board of directors at any time prior to the first date that a
person or group acquires 15 or more of our common stock

     we will not without the prior approval of a majority of directors acquire
from or sell to any director officer or employee of hcpi or any affiliate
thereof as the case may be any of our assets or other property

     we provide to our stockholders annual reports containing audited financial
statements and quarterly reports containing unaudited information

     the policies set forth herein have been established by our board of
directors and may be changed without stockholder approval

received an additional 29688 units in 1999 and 8324 units in 2001 as a result
of stepups in value of certain of the buildings during 2000 hcpiutah
determined that 505881 managing member units previously recorded and issued to
hcpi during 1999 should have been recorded as a loan from hcpi to retire

item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and
        results of operations

general

     health care property investors inc including its whollyowned
subsidiaries and affiliated joint ventures hcpi generally acquires health
care facilities and leases them on a longterm basis to health care providers
we also lease medical office space to providers and physicians on a shorter term
basis on a more limited basis we provide mortgage financing on health care
facilities as of december 31 2001 our portfolio of properties including
equity investments consisted of 429 facilities located in 42 states these
facilities are comprised of 176 longterm care facilities 94 congregate care
and assisted living facilities 86 medical office buildings 37 physician group
practice clinics 21 acute care hospitals nine freestanding rehabilitation
facilities and six health care laboratory and biotech research facilities our
gross investment in the properties which includes joint venture acquisitions
was approximately 27 billion at december 31 2001

revision of consolidated statements of income and statements of cash flows

     our consolidated statements of income and consolidated statements of cash
flows have been revised from those originally reported to separately reflect the
impairment losses related to depreciable property of 13640000 and 2751000
for the years ended december 31 2001 and 2000 respectively the losses arose
from the write down to fair value less costs to sell of 13 facilities during
2001 and four facilities during 2000 that will be or have been sold see note 3
to the consolidated financial statements the impairment losses related to
depreciable property were previously included in real estate depreciation the
revision had no impact on our consolidated balance sheets or statements of
stockholders equity the revision had no impact on the net revenues operating
income net income or net income per share of common stock for the years ended
december 31 2001 and 2000

     the primary focus of operations for 2001 was the completion of 240 million
of new investments we financed the acquisitions primarily through the proceeds
from the issuance of new equity and asset sales however the issuance of new
equity had the shortterm impact of deleveraging the company by paying down the
bank lines with longterm capital additionally we recorded lower market rents
on certain properties and recorded a 136 million writedown on 13 properties
related to the reorganization of certain nursing home and assisted living
operators

     on november 4 1999 american health properties inc ahe merged with and
into hcpi in a stockforstock transaction the merger resulted in the issuance
of 19430115 shares of our common stock and 4000000 depositary shares of our
series c cumulative redeemable preferred stock additionally upon consummation
of the merger we assumed ahes debt comprised of 220 million of senior notes
and 56 million of mortgage debt and paid 71 million in cash to replace its
revolving line of credit the transaction was treated as a purchase for
financial accounting purposes and accordingly the operating results of ahe
have been included in our consolidated financial statements effective november
1999

results of operations

     rental income attributable to triple net leases for the year ended december
31 2001 decreased 02 or 502000 to 226510000 the decrease is primarily
the result of the impact of dispositions made during 2000 and 2001 offset by
acquisition activity during 2001 rental income attributable to managed
properties for the year ended december 31 2001 increased 53 or 4274000 to
84092000 with a related increase in managed properties operating expenses of
85 or 2367000 to 30105000 these increases were generated primarily from
2001 acquisition activity see note 3 to the consolidated financial statements
interest and other income for the year ended december 31 2001 decreased 49 or
1119000 to 21858000 primarily as a result of a loan payoff in the first
quarter of 2001

     interest expense for the year ended december 31 2001 decreased 95 or
8258000 to 78489000 the decrease is primarily the result of lower
balances and interest rates on shortterm bank loans all described in more
detail within the liquidity and capital resources section the real estate
depreciation increased by 619000 to 70458000 for the year ended december
31 2001 as a result of 2001 acquisitions

     we believe that funds from operations ffo is the most important
supplemental measure of operating performance for a real estate investment trust
see note 14 to the consolidated financial statements ffo for the year ended
december 31 2001 increased 47 or 8031000 to 179375000 the increase is
mainly attributable to an increase in rental income managed properties and a
decrease in interest expense offset by decreases in rental income triple net
properties and interest and other income and an increase in managed properties
operating expenses

year ended december 31 2000 vs year ended december 31 1999

     net income applicable to common shares for the year ended december 31 2000
totaled 108867000 or 213 per share on a diluted basis on revenue of
329807000 this compares to net income applicable to common shares of
78450000 or 225 per share on a diluted basis on revenue of 224793000 for
the corresponding period in 1999 included in net income applicable to common
shares and earnings per share on a diluted basis for the years ended december
31 2000 and 1999 is a gain on sale of real estate properties of 11756000 or
023 per share and 10303000 or 027 per share respectively in addition
net income applicable to common shares for the year ended december 31 2000
includes a 2000000 or 004 per share onetime charge as a result of an
equity investment writeoff also included is a 2751000 or 005 per share
onetime charge as a result of the writedown to fair value less costs to sell
of four physician clinics to be sold see note 3 to the consolidated financial
statements the increase in net income applicable to common shares is primarily
the result of 1999 acquisition activity most of which is attributable to the
acquisition of ahes portfolio

     rental income attributable to triple net leases for the year ended december
31 2000 increased 578 or 83164000 to 227012000 rental income

decreased 89 or 2246000 to 22977000 primarily as a result of the
divestiture during mid 1999 of certain partnership interests from which we were
receiving income

     interest expense for the year ended december 31 2000 increased 484 or
28289000 to 86747000 the increase is primarily the result of an increase
in borrowings used to fund the acquisitions made during 1999 and the interest
related to the debt assumed in the merger with ahe all described in more detail
within the liquidity and capital resources section the increase in real
estate depreciation of 559 or 25050000 to 69839000 for the year ended
december 31 2000 is the direct result of the new investments made during 1999
including the merger with ahe

     ffo for the year ended december 31 2000 increased 496 or 56824000 to
171344000 the increase is mainly attributable to increases in rental income
as offset by increases in interest expense and managed properties operating
expenses which were previously discussed in more detail

 liquidity and capital resources

     we have financed investments through the sale of common and preferred
stock issuance of longterm debt assumption of mortgage debt the mortgaging
of certain of our properties use of shortterm bank lines and use of internally
generated cash flows we have also raised cash through the disposition of assets
in 2000 and 2001 management believes that our liquidity and sources of capital
are adequate to finance our operations future investments in additional
facilities see note 9 to the consolidated financial statements will be
dependent on the availability of costeffective sources of capital

     at december 31 2001 stockholders equity totaled 1246724000 our debt

no net effect on ffo for the year 2001 total rollovers were 26 facilities 40
facilities and 60 facilities in each of the years 1999 through 2001
respectively

troubled longterm care and assisted living operators

     the financial weakness of operators in the longterm care and assisted
living sectors may result in some uncertainties in our ability to continue to
realize the full benefit of such operators leases we cannot assure you that
the bankruptcies of certain longterm care operators and the trouble experienced
by assisted living operators would not have a material adverse effect on our net

item 7a disclosures about market risk

     our investments are financed by the sale of common stock longterm debt
internally generated cash flows and some shortterm bank debt

     we generally have fixed base rent on our leases in addition there can be
additional rent based on a percentage of increased revenue over specified base
period revenue of the properties andor

increases based on inflation indices or other factors financing costs are
comprised of dividends on preferred and common stock fixed interest on
longterm debt and shortterm interest on bank debt

     on a more limited basis we have provided mortgage loans to operators of
health care facilities in the normal course of business all of the mortgage
loans receivable have fixed interest rates or interest rates with periodic fixed
increases therefore the mortgage loans receivable are all considered to be
fixed rate loans and the current interest rate the lowest rate is used in the
computation of market risk provided in the following table if material

     we may assume existing mortgage notes payable as part of an acquisition
transaction currently we have two mortgage notes payable with variable interest
rates and the remaining mortgage notes payable have fixed interest rates or
interest rates with fixed periodic increases our senior notes are at fixed
rates with one exception for a 25000000 variable rate senior note for which
management has fixed the interest rate by means of a swap contract the variable
rate loans are at interest rates below the current prime rate of 475 and
fluctuations are tied to the prime rate or to a rate currently below the prime
rate

     at december 31 2001 we are exposed to market risks related to
fluctuations in interest rates only on 4882000 of variable rate mortgage
notes payable and 108500000 of variable rate bank debt out of our portfolio
of real estate of 2738000000

     fluctuation in the interest rate environment will not affect our future
earnings and cash flows on our fixed rate debt until that debt matures and must
be replaced or refinanced interest rate changes will affect the fair value of
the fixed rate instruments conversely changes in interest rates on variable
rate debt would change our future earnings and cash flows but not affect the
fair value on those instruments assuming a one percentage point increase in the
interest rate related to the variable rate debt including the mortgage notes
payable and the bank lines of credit and assuming no change in the outstanding
balance as of year end interest expense for 2001 would increase by
approximately 1134000

     the principal amount and the average interest rates for the mortgage loans
receivable and debt categorized by the final maturity dates is presented in the
following table the fair value estimates for the mortgage loans receivable are
based on the estimates of management and on rates currently prevailing for
comparable loans the fair market value estimates for debt securities are based
on discounting future cash flows utilizing current rates offered to us for debt
of the same type and remaining maturity

     for the purposes of complying with the amendments to the rules governing
form s8 effective july 13 1990 under the securities act of 1933 the
undersigned registrant hereby undertakes as follows which undertaking shall be
incorporated by reference into registrants registration statement on form s8
nos 3328483 and 33390353 filed may 11 1989 and november 5 1999
respectively and form s8 nos 33354786 and 33354784 each filed february 1
2001

     insofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under the securities act
of 1933 may be permitted to directors officers and controlling persons of the
registrant pursuant to the foregoing provisions or otherwise the registrant
has been advised that in the opinion of the securities and exchange commission
such indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the securities act
of 1933 and is therefore unenforceable in the event that a claim for
indemnification against such liabilities other than the payment by the
registrant of expenses incurred or paid by a director officer or controlling
person of the registrant in the successful defense of any action suit or
proceeding is asserted by such director officer or controlling person in
connection with the securities being registered the registrant will unless in
the opinion of its counsel the matter has been settled by controlling precedent
submit to a court of appropriate jurisdiction the question whether such
indemnification by it is against public policy expressed in the securities act
of 1933 and will be governed by the final adjudication of such issue

                   notes to consolidated financial statements

1  the company

     health care property investors inc a maryland corporation was organized
in march 1985 to qualify as a real estate investment trust reit health care

revision of consolidated statements of income and statements of cash flows

     our consolidated statements of income and consolidated statements of cash
flows have been revised from those originally reported to separately reflect the
impairment losses related to depreciable property of 13640000 and 2751000
for the years ended december 31 2001 and 2000 respectively the losses arose
from the write down to fair value less costs to sell of 13 facilities during
2001 and four facilities during 2000 that will be or have been sold see note 3
to the consolidated financial statements the impairment losses related to
depreciable property were previously included in real estate depreciation the
revision had no impact on our consolidated balance sheets or statements of
stockholders equity the revision had no impact on the net revenues operating
income net income or net income per share of common stock for the years ended
december 31 2001 and 2000

2  significant accounting policies

rental and interest income

     rental income includes base and additional rental income additional rental
income is generated by a percentage of increased revenue over specified base
period revenue of the properties andor increases based on inflation indices or
other factors in addition we may receive payments from lessees upon transfer
or assignment of existing leases such amounts received are deferred and
amortized over the remaining term of the leases

     we have certain leases and mortgages that have contractual fixed increases
in rents and interest we record straightline rents and interest in cases where
we believe such rents and interest are sustainable

     during 2000 we adopted the securities and exchange commission sec staff
accounting bulletin no 101 sab 101 revenue recognition in financial
statements under sab 101 we are required to defer income recognition of
additional rents that are based on facility revenue increases until an annual
rather than quarterly contractual facility revenue hurdle is exceeded due to
our current lease structures sab 101 will delay the recognition of certain
additional rents from the first quarter of a year to subsequent quarters of the
year we previously followed the practice of estimating and applying rents
ratably throughout each of the quarters sab 101 had no impact on our results of
operations for the year ended december 31 2001 and had a minor impact in
reducing income by 300000 in our results of operations for the year ended
december 31 2000

managed property operations

     we have ownership interests in 68 mobs 27 physician group practice clinics
and six health care laboratory and biotech research facilities which are managed
by independent property management companies on our behalf these facilities are
leased to multiple tenants under gross modified gross or triple net leases
both operating income and rental income other than basic rental income
attributable to these properties are recorded under rental income managed
properties in our


                                       f7

page

financial statements expenses related to the operation of these facilities are
recorded as managed properties operating expenses

real estate

     we record the acquisition of real estate at cost and use the straightline
method of depreciation for buildings and improvements over estimated useful
lives ranging up to 45 years we periodically evaluate our investments in real
estate for potential impairment by comparing our investment to the expected
future cash flows to be generated from the properties if such impairments were
to occur we would writedown our investment in the property to estimated market
value in addition certain of our investments are in the process of being sold
in instances where the expected sales price is projected to be less than the net
investment we will writedown our investment in the property to market value
acquisition development and construction arrangements are accounted for as real
estate investmentsjoint ventures or loans based on the characteristics of the
arrangements

investments in consolidated subsidiaries and partnerships

     we consolidate the accounts of our subsidiaries and certain general and
limited partnerships which are majority owned and controlled all significant
intercompany investments accounts and transactions have been eliminated

investments in and advances to joint ventures

     we have investments in certain general partnerships and joint ventures see
note 6 following in which we may serve as the general partner or managing
member however since the other members in these joint ventures have
significant voting rights relative to acquisition sale and refinancing of
assets we account for these investments using the equity method of accounting
the accounting policies of these joint ventures are substantially consistent
with those of hcpi

federal income taxes

     we have operated at all times so as to qualify as a reit under sections 856
to 860 of the internal revenue code of 1986 as such we are not taxed on our
income that is distributed to stockholders at december 31 2001 the tax basis
of our net assets and liabilities is less than the reported amounts by
approximately 216000000 the majority of this difference is attributable to
the merger of american health properties inc in 1999 wherein for reporting
purposes the assets are recordable at fair market value while tax bases remain
at historical cost additional variances are caused by accelerated depreciation
for tax assets and differences in tax basis value versus fair market value in
three limited liability companies which are consolidated and where we are the
managing member

     earnings and profits which determine the taxability of dividends to
stockholders differ from net income for financial statements due to the
treatment required under the internal revenue code of certain interest income
and expense items depreciable lives bases of assets and timing of rental
income

derivatives and hedging


                                       f8

page

     during 1999 we entered into a 25000000 swap contract through which the
variable interest rate on a senior note is fixed until its february 2004
maturity pursuant to financial accounting standards boards statement of
financial accounting standards no 133 accounting for derivative instruments
and hedging activities statement 133 which is applicable as of 2001 this
swap is recorded as a cash flow hedge the swap qualifies for the shortcut
method under statement 133 as the notional and principal amount are the same
the fair value of the swap at inception is zero net settlements under the swap
are based on the same index at each settlement date the interest bearing
liability is not prepayable as defined and there are no other terms of the
hedged item or interest rate swap that would invalidate the assumption of
effectiveness as such we have reflected the unrealized loss based on the
change in fair market value of 1140000 as of december 31 2001 as an
accumulated comprehensive loss see note 12 which is recorded under other
equity on the face of the balance sheet if the note is held to maturity the
unrealized loss will not be incurred prior to december 31 2001 the fair
market value was considered immaterial

     statement 133 established accounting and reporting standards requiring that
every derivative instrument including certain derivative instruments embedded
in other contracts be recorded in the balance sheet as either an asset or
liability measured at its fair value additionally changes in the derivatives
fair value are recognized as comprehensive income if specific hedge accounting
criteria are met if these criteria are not met changes in the fair value are
to be included in earnings

cash and cash equivalents

     investments purchased with original maturities of three months or less are
considered to be cash and cash equivalents

use of estimates in the preparation of financial statements

     management is required to make estimates and assumptions in the preparation
of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting
principles these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of
assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at
the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of expense during
the reporting period actual results could differ from those estimates

reclassification

     reclassifications have been made for comparative financial statement
presentation

3  real estate investments

     hcpi was organized to make longterm equityoriented investments
principally in operating incomeproducing health care related properties our
equity investments have generally been structured as land and building
leasebacks

     under the terms of the lease agreements we earn fixed monthly base rental
income and may earn periodic additional rental income at december 31 2001
minimum future rental income from 364 properties with noncancelable operating
leases is expected to be approximately 269918000 in 2002 260877000 in
2003 207134000 in 2004 184531000 in 2005 171495000 in 2006 and
722932000 in the aggregate thereafter

kindred healthcare inc formerly vencor inc

     we have negotiated a new lease with kindred healthcare inc kindred
for 22 facilities whose leases were scheduled originally to expire in august
2001 for lease renewal purposes the facilities comprise three groups with
maturities of nine ten and eleven years the annual rent on these facilities
has increased by 3300000 to 16100000 in the first lease year ten
additional facilities were originally leased to kindred of those ten six have

rents to us of an estimated 200000 annually three have been subsequently
sold and one is being considered for lease to a third party

13 earnings per common share

     we compute earnings per share in accordance with statement of financial
accounting standards no 128 earnings per share basic earnings per common
share is computed by dividing net income applicable to common shares by the
weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period
diluted earnings per common share are calculated including the effect of
dilutive securities approximately 800000 options to purchase shares of common
stock that had an exercise price in excess of the average market price of the
common stock during the period were not included because they are not dilutive

14 funds from operations

     we are required to report information about operations on the basis that we
use internally to measure performance under statement of financial accounting
standards no 131 disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related
information effective beginning in 1998

     we believe that funds from operations ffo is the most important
supplemental measure of operating performance for a real estate investment
trust because the historical cost accounting convention used for real estate
assets requires straightline depreciation except on land such accounting
presentation implies that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably
over time since real estate values instead have historically risen and fallen
with market conditions presentations of operating results for a real estate
investment trust that uses historical cost accounting for depreciation could be
less informative the term ffo was designed by the real estate investment trust
industry to address this problem

     we adopted the definition of ffo prescribed by the national association of
real estate investment trusts nareit ffo is defined as net income applicable
to common shares computed in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles excluding gains or losses from debt restructuring and sales of
property plus real estate depreciation and real estate related amortization
and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures
adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures are calculated to
reflect ffo on the same basis

     ffo does not represent cash generated from operating activities in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles is not necessarily
indicative of cash available to fund cash needs and should not be considered as
an alternative to net income ffo as defined by hcpi may not be comparable to
similarly entitled items reported by other real estate investment trusts that do
not define it exactly as the nareit definition

     below are summaries of the calculation of ffo for the years ended december
31 2001 2000 and 1999 all amounts in thousands

15 disclosures about fair value of financial instruments

     the following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair value
of each class of financial instruments for which it is practicable to estimate
that value the carrying amount for cash and cash equivalents approximates fair
value because of the shortterm maturity of those instruments fair values for
mortgage loans receivable and senior notes and mortgage notes payable are based
on the estimates of management and on rates currently prevailing for comparable
loans and instruments of comparable maturities and are as follows

         longterm care facilities we have invested in 172 longterm care
facilities various healthcare providers operate these facilities longterm
care facilities offer restorative rehabilitative and custodial nursing care for
people not requiring the more extensive and sophisticated treatment available at
acute care hospitals many longterm care facilities had experienced significant
growth in ancillary revenues and demand for subacute care services over the past
ten years until the prospective payment system was implemented in july 1998
ancillary

revenues and revenue from subacute care services are derived from providing
services to residents beyond room and board and include occupational physical
speech respiratory and iv therapy wound care oncology treatment brain injury
care and orthopedic therapy as well as sales of pharmaceutical products and
other services certain longterm care facilities provide some of the foregoing
services on an outpatient basis longterm care facilities are designed to
supplement hospital care and many have transfer agreements with one or more
acute care hospitals these facilities depend to some degree upon referrals from
practicing physicians and hospitals longterm care services are paid for either
by private sources or through the federal medicare and state medicaid programs

         longterm care facilities generally provide patients with
accommodations complete medical and nursing care and rehabilitation services
including speech physical and occupational therapy as a part of the omnibus
budget reconciliation act obra of 1981 congress established a waiver
program under medicaid to offer an alternative to institutional longterm care
services the provisions of obra and the subsequent obra acts of 1987 and 1990
allow states with federal approval greater flexibility in program design as a
means of developing costeffective alternatives to delivering services
traditionally provided in the longterm care setting this is a contributing
factor to the recent increase in the number of assisted living facilities which
may adversely affect some longterm care facilities as some individuals choose
the residential environment and lower cost delivery system provided in the
assisted living setting

         acute care hospitals we have an interest in 18 general acute care
         
hospitals and four longterm acute care hospitals acute care hospitals offer a
wide range of services such as fullyequipped operating and recovery rooms
obstetrics radiology intensive care open heart surgery and coronary care

units oncology clinical laboratories respiratory therapy physical therapy
nuclear medicine rehabilitation services and outpatient services

         longterm acute care hospitals provide care for patients with complex
medical conditions that require more intensive care monitoring or emergency
backup than that available in most skilled nursingbased subacute programs
most longterm acute care hospital patients have severe chronic health problems
and are medically unstable or at risk of medical instability the most common
cases treated in this setting include high acuity ventilatordependent patients
and patients with multiple system failures relating to cancer spinal cord
injuries or head injuries

         services are paid for by private sources third party payors eg
insurance and hmos or through the federal medicare and state medicaid
programs medicare provides reimbursement incentives to traditional general
acute care hospitals to minimize inpatient length of stay

         rehabilitation hospitals we have investments in nine rehabilitation
         
hospitals these hospitals provide inpatient and outpatient care for patients
who have sustained traumatic injuries or illnesses such as spinal cord
injuries strokes head injuries orthopedic problems work related disabilities
and neurological diseases as well as treatment for amputees and patients with

competition

partnerships real estate lenders and other investors

        our properties are subject to competition from the properties of other
healthcare providers certain of these other operators have capital resources
substantially in excess of some of the operators of our facilities in addition
the extent to which the properties are utilized depends upon several factors
including the number of physicians using the healthcare facilities or referring
patients there competitive systems of healthcare delivery and the size and
composition of the population in the surrounding area private federal and
state payment programs and the effect of other laws and regulations may also
have a significant influence on the utilization of the properties virtually all

vencor

         on may 1 1998 vencor completed a spinoff transaction to become two
publicly held entities  ventas inc a reit and vencor a healthcare
operating company which at december 31 2000 leased 34 of our properties of
which nine are subleased to other operators on september 13 1999 vencor filed
for bankruptcy protection hcpi has recourse to ventas inc and tenet
healthcare corporation for most of the obligations payable by vencor under its
leases until the third quarter of 2001 the bankruptcy court confirmed vencors
plan of reorganization in march 2001

         vencors plan proposes the assumption of all of our leased facilities
including nine subleased facilities the assumption of our leases would mean
the continued performance of all of vencors obligations under the leases
including all amounts owing prior to vencors filing date vencor has paid most
of these prepetition amounts and has continued to remain current on its rent
during its bankruptcy proceedings

         almost all of our vencor facilities have leases which expire in 2001
negotiations are in progress on the 23 facilities that would remain as new
leases with vencor with definitive agreements in place on four of nine
subleased facilities with current operators progress has been made for current
operators to retain operations on most of the remaining five subleased
facilities it

is anticipated that a net rent increase will result from negotiation with vencor
and others for the 32 facilities discussed in this paragraph

         based upon public reports for the three months ended september 30
2000 vencor had revenue of approximately 717 million and a net loss of
approximately 27 million for the nine months ended september 30 2000 vencor
had revenue of approximately 21 billion and a net loss of approximately 48
million based upon public reports ventas revenue and net income for the nine
months ended september 30 2000 were approximately 180 million and 18 million
respectively as of september 30 2000 ventas had total assets of 10 billion
and a stockholders deficit of 14 million

tenet

         tenet is one of the nations largest healthcare services companies
providing a broad range of services through the ownership and management of
healthcare facilities tenet has historically guaranteed vencors leases during
1997 we reached an agreement with tenet whereby tenet agreed to forbear or waive
some renewal and purchase options and related rights of first refusal on
facilities leased to vencor and we agreed to pay tenet 5000000 in cash and to
reduce tenets guarantees on the facilities leased to vencor as part of that
same agreement we only have recourse to tenet for the rent payments on the
vencor leases until the end of their base term accordingly we have recourse to
tenet on 29 vencor leases which will expire during 2001

hca  the healthcare company

         according to published reports columbia has been the subject of
various significant government investigations regarding its compliance with
medicare medicaid and other programs the following is derived from public
reports distributed by hca formerly known as columbiahca healthcare corp
hca and its affiliates reached an agreement with the criminal division of the
department of justice doj and us attorneys offices to resolve all pending
federal criminal issues in the columbia investigation the terms of this
agreement resulted in the recording of an after tax charge of approximately 95
million or 017 per diluted share in the fourth quarter of 2000 in the
second quarter of 2000 hca recorded an aftertax charge of 498 million or
089 per diluted share in connection with its civil settlement of certain
issues with the doj hca paid the criminal settlement in the first quarter of
2001 and expects to pay the civil settlement in the first or second quarter of
2001 hca maintains debt ratings of ba2 from moodys and bb from standard

other troubled longterm care providers

         the financial condition of many longterm care providers in part due
to the implementation of the medicare prospective payment system resulted in
several longterm care provider lessees filing for chapter xi bankruptcy
protection during late 1999 and early 2000 lessees other than vencor that
have filed for bankruptcy and their respective percentage of the companys
annualized revenue are sun healthcare  11 integrated health services  05
genesis health ventures  05 mariner post acute network  04 lenox
healthcare  03 and texas health enterprises  02 the lessees in bankruptcy
were current on all rents as of december 31 2000 with the exception of minor
prepetition receivables which we believe will

                                      11

generally be payable once the plans of reorganization are confirmed lenox
healthcare and texas health enterprises have both exited bankruptcy

         the assisted living industry from which the company derives 142 of
its revenue has experienced overbuilding in a number of areas and slower
fillup rates than were originally forecast this has required certain operators
to raise additional capital to sustain operations during fillup periods
additional capital may be required during 2001 however these factors have
stemmed further development activity which should allow improved fillup of
existing facilities and improvement in industry census

         the companys management recorded a complete writeoff of a 2000000
equity investment in summerville senior living ssl an assisted living
company although this investment represents less than 01 of gross real estate
investment and is outside the normal investment strategy of the company the
writeoff reduces net income see impairment of equity investment and reduces
reported ffo no income has been recorded on this equity investment in addition
to the equity investment the company has loaned 13500000 to ssl with ten
leased facilities in california as collateral and owns five facilities that are
leased to ssl revenue from ssl equals approximately 15 of the companys total
revenue the 1200000 letter of credit provided in connection with the five
facility leases and the loan discussed previously to ssl exceeds unpaid rents
and interest due from them

         we cannot assure you that the bankruptcies of certain longterm care
operators and the trouble experienced by assisted living operators would not
have a material adverse effect on our net income ffo or the market value of our
common stock

leases and loans

         the initial base rental rates of the triple net leases we entered into
during the three years ended december 31 2000 have generally ranged from 9 to
13 per annum of the acquisition price of the related property initial interest
rates on the loans we entered into during the three years ended december 31
2000 have generally ranged from 9 to 12 per annum rental rates vary by lease
taking into consideration many factors such as

            creditworthiness of the lessee
            operating performance of the facility
            interest rates at the beginning of the lease
            location type and physical condition of the facility

         certain leases provide for additional rents that are based upon a
percentage of increased revenue over specific base period revenue of the leased
properties others have rent increases based on inflation indices or other
factors and some leases and loans have annual fixed rent or interest rate
increases see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements in this annual
report on form 10k

         in addition to the minimum and additional rents each lessee under a
triple net lease is responsible for all additional charges including charges
related to nonpayment or late payment of rent taxes and assessments

properties leased under triple net leases

         each lessee with a gross or modified gross lease is also responsible
for minimum and additional rents but may not be responsible for all operating
expenses under gross or modified gross leases we may be responsible for
property taxes repairs and maintenance andor insurance on those properties

         the primary or fixed terms of the triple net and modified gross leases
generally range from 10 to 15 years and generally have one or more fiveyear
or longer renewal options the average remaining base leaseterm on the triple
net and modified gross leases is approximately seven years the primary term of
the gross leases to multiple tenants in the medical office buildings range from
one to 20 years with an average of six years remaining on those leases
obligations under the triplenet leases in most cases have corporate parent or
shareholder guarantees irrevocable letters of credit from various financial
institutions and lease deposits back 127 leases and loans on 15 facilities which
cover from one to 18 months of lease or loan payments we require the lessees
and mortgagors to renew such letters of credit during the lease or loan term in
amounts that may change based upon the passage of time improved operating cash
flows or improved credit ratings

         we believe that the credit enhancements discussed above provide us with
significant protection for our investment portfolio as of january 31 2001
other than approximately 27 million in delinquent rents and interest of which
approximately 10 million is covered by credit enhancements we are currently
receiving rents and interest in a timely manner from substantially all lessees
and mortgagors as provided under the terms of the leases or loans we have
provided reserves against the remaining amounts

         based upon information provided to us by lessees or mortgagors certain
facilities are presently underperforming financially individual facilities may
underperform as a result of inadequate medicaid reimbursement low occupancy
less than optimal patient mix excessive operating costs other operational
issues or capital needs we believe that even if these facilities remain at
current levels of performance the lease and loan provisions contain sufficient
security to assure that material rental and mortgage obligations will continue
to be met for the remainder of the lease or loan terms in the future it is
expected that some lessees may choose not to renew their leases on certain
properties at existing rental rates see table below

         many lessees have the right of first refusal to purchase the properties
during the lease term many leases provide one or more fiveyear or longer
renewal options at existing lease rates and continuing additional rent formulas
although certain leases provide for lease renewals at fair market value certain
lessees also have options to purchase the properties generally for fair market
value and generally at the expiration of the primary lease term andor any
renewal term under the lease if options are exercised many such provisions
require lessees to purchase or renew several facilities together precluding the
possibility of lessees purchasing or renewing only those facilities with the
best financial outcomes fiftyeight properties are not subject to purchase
options until 2008 or later and an additional 309 leased properties do not have
any purchase options

         a table recapping lease expirations mortgage maturities properties
subject to purchase options and financial underperformance as of december 31
2000 follows

    1  this column includes the revenue impact by year and the total
         annualized rental and interest income associated with the properties
         subject to lessees renewal options andor purchase options and
         mortgage maturities

    2  this column includes the revenue impact by year and the total
         annualized rental and interest income associated with properties
         subject to purchase options if a purchase option is exercisable at
         more than one date the convention used in the table is to show the
         revenue subject to the purchase option at the date management estimates
         is most likely for exercise of the option although certain purchase
         option periods commenced in earlier years lessees have not exercised
         their purchase options as of this time the total for this column 2
         145398000 is a component subset of column 1 the total current
         annualized revenue of properties subject to lease expirations purchase
         options and mortgage maturities

   3   based on current market conditions we estimate that there could be a
         revenue gainloss compared to current rental rates upon the
         expiration of the current term of the leases in the percentages and
         amounts shown in the table for lease expirations the percentages are
         computed by taking the possible revenue gainloss as a percentage of
         2000 total annualized revenue

   4   we estimate that in addition to the possible reduction in income from
         lease expirations we may also have a decrease of approximately
         400000 in 2001 due to the reinvestment of cash received from mortgage
         maturities and facility sales this amount is calculated based on
         current interest rate levels and is not estimated in years subsequent
         to 2001 due to the unpredictable levels of facility sales and interest
         rates and their impact on sales and mortgage maturities

         there are numerous factors that could have an impact on lease renewals
or facility sales including the financial strength of the lessee expected
facility operating performance the relative level of interest rates and
individual lessee financing options based upon management expectations of our
continued growth the facilities subject to renewal andor sale and mortgage
maturities and any possible rent loss therefrom should represent a small
percentage of revenue in the year of renewal or purchase

         each lessee at its expense may make noncapital additions
modifications or improvements to its leased property all such alterations
replacements and improvements must comply with the terms and provisions of the
lease and become our or our affiliates property upon termination of the lease
leases generally require the lessee to maintain adequate insurance on the leased
property naming us or our affiliates and any mortgagees as additional insureds
in certain circumstances the lessee may selfinsure pursuant to a prudent
program of selfinsurance if the lessee or the guarantor of its lease
obligations has substantial net worth in addition each lease

                                      14

requires the lessee to indemnify us or our affiliates against certain
liabilities in connection with the leased property

development of facilities

         since 1987 we have committed to the development of 58 facilities as
of december 31 2000 we have funded costs of approximately 407 million and
have completed all 58 facilities of our total development commitment the
completed facilities comprise

            35 congregate care and assisted living facilities
            seven longterm care facilities
            seven medical office buildings
            five rehabilitation hospitals
            four acute care hospitals

         simultaneously with the commencement of each of these development
programs and prior to funding we enter into a lease agreement with the
developeroperator the base rent under the lease is generally established at a
rate equivalent to a specified number of basis points over 1 the yield on the
10 year united states treasury note or 2 our cost of money at the commencement
of the lease

         our build to suit development program generally includes a variety of
additional forms of credit enhancement and collateral beyond those provided by
the leases during the development period we generally require additional
security and collateral in the form of more than one of the following

         a   irrevocable letters of credit from financial institutions
         b   payment and performance bonds and
         c   completion guarantees by either one or a combination of the
               developeroperators parent entity other affiliates or one or
               more of the individual principals who control the
               developeroperator

         in addition before we advance any funds under the development
agreement the developeroperator must provide

         a   satisfactory evidence in the form of an endorsement to our title
               insurance policy that no intervening liens have been placed on
               the property since the date of our previous advance
         b   a certificate executed by the project architect that indicates
               that all construction work completed on the project conforms with
               the requirements of the applicable plans and specifications
         c   a certificate executed by the general contractor that all work
               requested for reimbursement has been completed and
         d   satisfactory evidence that the funds remaining unadvanced are
               sufficient for the payment of all costs necessary for the
               completion of the project in accordance with the terms and
               provisions of the agreement

                                      15
page

         as a further safeguard during the development period we generally will
retain 10 of construction funds incurred until we have received satisfactory
evidence that the project will be fully completed in accordance with the
applicable plans and specifications we also monitor the progress of the
development of each project and the accuracy of the developeroperators draw
requests by having its own inhouse inspector perform regular onsite
inspections of the project prior to the release of any requested funds

investments in consolidated and nonconsolidated joint ventures

         at december 31 2000 we also had varying percentage interests in
several limited liability companies and partnerships that together own 58
facilities and one mortgage as further discussed below

    1  a 77 interest in a partnership health care property partners which
         owns two acute care hospitals and 18 longterm care facilities and has
         one mortgage on a longterm care facility

future acquisitions

         we anticipate acquiring additional healthcare related facilities and
leasing them to healthcare operators or investing in mortgages secured by
healthcare facilities

taxation of hcpi

         we believe that we have operated in such a manner as to qualify for
taxation as a reit under sections 856 to 860 of the internal revenue code of
1986 as amended the code commencing with our taxable year ended december
31 1985 and we intend to continue to operate in such a manner no assurance
can be given that we have operated or will be able to continue to operate in a
manner so as to qualify or to remain so qualified this summary is qualified in
its entirety by the applicable code provisions rules and regulations
promulgated thereunder and administrative and judicial interpretations thereof

                                      16
page

         if we qualify for taxation as a reit we will generally not be required
to pay federal corporate income taxes on the portion of our net income that is
currently distributed to stockholders this treatment substantially eliminates
the double taxation ie at the corporate and stockholder levels that
generally results from investment in a corporation however we will be required
to pay federal income tax under certain circumstances

         the code defines a reit as a corporation trust or association i
which is managed by one or more trustees or directors ii the beneficial
ownership of which is evidenced by transferable shares or by transferable
certificates of beneficial interest iii which would be taxable but for
sections 856 through 860 of the code as a domestic corporation iv which is
neither a financial institution nor an insurance company subject to certain
provisions of the code v the beneficial ownership of which is held by 100 or
more persons vi during the last half of each taxable year not more than 50
in value of the outstanding stock of which is owned actually or constructively
by five or fewer individuals and vii which meets certain other tests
described below regarding the amount of its distributions and the nature of its
income and assets the code provides that conditions i to iv inclusive
must be met during the entire taxable year and that condition v must be met
during at least 335 days of a taxable year of 12 months or during a
proportionate part of a taxable year of less than 12 months

         there presently are two gross income requirements first at least 75
of our gross income excluding gross income from prohibited transactions as
defined below for each taxable year must be derived directly or indirectly from
investments relating to real property or mortgages on real property or from
certain types of temporary investment income second at least 95 of our gross
income excluding gross income from prohibited transactions for each taxable
year must be derived from income that qualifies under the 75 test and all other
dividends interest and gain from the sale or other disposition of stock or
securities a prohibited transaction is a sale or other disposition of
property other than foreclosure property held for sale to customers in the
ordinary course of business

         at the close of each quarter of our taxable year we must also satisfy
three tests relating to the nature of our assets first at least 75 of the
value of our total assets must be represented by real estate assets including
stock or debt instruments held for not more than one year purchased with the
proceeds of a stock offering or longterm more than five years public debt
offering by us cash cash items and government securities second not more
than 25 of our total assets may be represented by securities other than those
in the 75 asset class third of the investments included in the 25 asset
class the value of any one issuers securities owned by us may not exceed 5 of
the value of our total assets and we may not own more than 10 of any one
issuers outstanding voting securities

         in 1999 legislation was enacted that modifies some of the rules that
apply to reits specifically the legislation includes a provision that limits a
reits ability to own more than 10 of the vote or value of the securities of a
nonreit corporation other than certain debt securities however the
legislation would allow a reit to own any percentage of the voting stock and
value of the securities of a corporation which jointly elects with the reit to
be a taxable reit subsidiary provided certain requirements are met a taxable
reit subsidiary generally may engage in any business including the provision of
customary or noncustomary services to tenants of its parent reit and of others
except a taxable reit subsidiary may not manage or operate a healthcare
facility also the legislation imposes a 100 tax on a reit if its rental
service or

                                      17
page

other agreements with its taxable reit subsidiary are not on arms length terms
this legislation will require us to monitor the securities we own in other
corporations and possibly restructure such investments if we own more than 10
of the value of the securities of any of these corporations the provisions
discussed above are generally effective for taxable years ending after december
31 2000 and assuming specified requirements are met do not apply to
investments in place on or before july 12 1999 as is presently the case a
reit may continue to own 100 of the stock of a qualified reit subsidiary as
defined below

         we own interests in various partnerships and limited liability
companies in the case of a reit that is a partner in a partnership or a member
of a limited liability company that is treated as a partnership under the code
treasury regulations provide that for purposes of the reit income and asset
tests the reit will be deemed to own its proportionate share of the assets of
the partnership or limited liability company and will be deemed to be entitled
to the income of the partnership or limited liability company attributable to
such share the ownership of an interest in a partnership or limited liability
company by a reit may involve special tax risks including the challenge by the
internal revenue service the service of the allocations of income and
expense items of the partnership or limited liability company which would
affect the computation of taxable income of the reit and the status of the
partnership or limited liability company as a partnership as opposed to an
association taxable as a corporation for federal income tax purposes we also
own interests in a number of subsidiaries which are intended to be treated as
qualified reit subsidiaries each a qrs the code provides that such
subsidiaries will be ignored for federal income tax purposes and all assets
liabilities and items of income deduction and credit of such subsidiaries will
be treated as assets liabilities and such items of ours if any partnership
limited liability company or subsidiary in which we own an interest were
treated as a regular corporation and not as a partnership or qrs for federal
income tax purposes we would likely fail to satisfy the reit asset tests
described above and would therefore fail to qualify as a reit we believe that
each of the partnerships limited liability companies and subsidiaries in which
we own an interest will be treated for tax purposes as a partnership in the
case of a partnership or limited liability company or qrs respectively
although no assurance can be given that the service will not successfully
challenge the status of any such organization

         in order to qualify as a reit we are required to distribute dividends
other than capital gain dividends to our stockholders in an amount at least
equal to a the sum of i 95 of our real estate investment trust taxable
income computed without regard to the dividends paid deduction and our net
capital gain and ii 95 of the net income if any after tax from
foreclosure property minus b the sum of certain items of noncash income
pursuant to recently enacted legislation the 95 distribution requirement
discussed above will be reduced to 90 effective for taxable years beginning
after december 31 2000 such distributions must be paid in the taxable year to
which they relate or in the following taxable year if declared before we timely
file our tax return for such year if paid on or before the first regular
dividend payment date after such declaration and if we so elect and specify the
dollar amount in our tax return to the extent that we do not distribute all of
our net longterm capital gain or distribute at least 95 but less than 100
of our real estate investment trust taxable income as adjusted we will be
required to pay tax thereon at regular corporate tax rates furthermore if we
should fail to distribute during each calendar year at least the sum of i 85
of our ordinary income for such year ii 95 of our capital gain income for
such year and iii any undistributed taxable income from prior periods we
would be required to pay a 4 excise tax on the excess of such required
distributions over the amounts actually distributed

                                      18
page

         if we fail to qualify for taxation as a reit in any taxable year and
certain relief provisions do not apply we will be required to pay tax
including any applicable alternative minimum tax on our taxable income at
regular corporate rates distributions to stockholders in any year in which we
fail to qualify will not be deductible by us nor will they be required to be
made unless entitled to relief under specific statutory provisions we will
also be disqualified from taxation as a reit for the four taxable years
following the year during which qualification was lost it is not possible to
state whether in all circumstances we would be entitled to the statutory relief
failure to qualify for even one year could substantially reduce distributions to
stockholders and could result in our incurring substantial indebtedness to the
extent borrowings are feasible or liquidating substantial investments in order
to pay the resulting taxes

         on november 4 1999 we acquired ahe in a merger ahe had also made an
election to be taxed as a reit if ahe failed to qualify as a reit for any of
its taxable years it would be subject to federal income tax including any
applicable alternative minimum tax on its taxable income at regular corporate
rates as successorininterest to ahe we would be required to pay this tax in
addition in connection with the merger and to the extent that the merger is
treated as a reorganization under the code we succeeded to various tax
attributes of ahe including any undistributed c corporation earnings and
profits of ahe a c corporation is generally defined as a corporation which is
required to pay a full corporatelevel tax if ahe qualified as a reit for all
years prior to the merger and the merger is treated as a reorganization under
the code then ahe would not have any undistributed c corporation earnings and
profits if however ahe failed to qualify as a reit for any year then it is
possible that we acquired undistributed c corporation earnings and profits from
ahe if we did not distribute these c corporation earnings and profits prior to
the end of 1999 we would fail to qualify as a reit ahes counsel rendered
opinions in connection with the merger to the effect that based on the facts
representations and assumptions stated therein commencing with its taxable year
ended december 31 1987 ahe was organized in conformity with the requirements
for qualification and taxation as a reit under the code and its method of
operation enabled it to meet through the effective time of the merger the
requirements for qualification and taxation as a reit under the code

         we and our stockholders may be required to pay state or local tax in
various state or local jurisdictions including those in which we or they
transact business or reside the state and local tax treatment of us and our
stockholders may not conform to the federal income tax consequences discussed
above

 government regulation

         the healthcare industry is heavily regulated by federal state and
local laws this government regulation of the healthcare industry affects us
because

     1 the financial ability of lessees to make rent and debt payments to us
         may be affected by governmental regulations such as licensure
         certification for participation in government programs and government
         reimbursement and

     2 our additional rents are often based on our lessees gross revenue from
         operations which in turn are affected by the amount of reimbursement
         such lessees receive from the government

                                      19
page

         these laws and regulations are subject to frequent and substantial
changes resulting from legislation adoption of rules and regulations and
administrative and judicial interpretations of existing law these changes may
have a dramatic effect on the definition of permissible or impermissible
activities the relative costs associated with doing business and the amount of
reimbursement by both government and other thirdparty payors these changes may
be applied retroactively the ultimate timing or effect of these changes cannot
be predicted the failure of any borrower of funds from us or lessee of any of
our properties to comply with such laws requirements and regulations could
affect its ability to operate its facility or facilities and could adversely
affect such borrowers or lessees ability to make debt or lease payments to us

         fraud and abuse there are various federal and state laws prohibiting
fraud by healthcare providers including criminal provisions which prohibit
filing false claims or making false statements to receive payment or
certification under medicare and medicaid or failing to refund overpayments or
improper payments violation of these federal provisions is a felony punishable
by up to five years imprisonment andor a 25000 fine civil provisions
prohibit the knowing filing of a false claim or the knowing use of false
statements to obtain payment the penalties for such violations may include
fines ranging from 5000 to 10000 plus treble damages for each claim filed

         there are also laws that attempt to eliminate fraud and abuse by
prohibiting payment arrangements that include compensation for patient
referrals the federal antikickback law prohibits among other things the
offer payment solicitation or receipt of any form of remuneration in return
for or to induce the referral of medicare medicaid or other federal health
care program patients a wide array of relationships and arrangements including
ownership interests in a company by persons who refer or who are in a position
to refer patients as well as personal services agreements have under certain
circumstances been alleged or been found to violate these provisions in
addition to the antikickback statute federal law also restricts physicians who
have financial relationships with hospitals and other providers of healthcare
services from making referrals for certain services to those providers in
august 1995 the federal government released final regulations addressing
physician referral prohibitions relating to financial relationships with
entities that furnish clinical laboratory services in january 2001 the federal
government released the first portion of final regulations that explain the
scope of the physician referral prohibition with respect to entities that
furnish certain designated health services the provisions contained within
the january 2001 package are expected to take effect sometime in early 2002
these regulations will impact healthcare providers financial and contractual
arrangements with physicians

         state and federal governments are devoting increasing attention and
resources to antifraud initiatives against healthcare providers the health
insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 and the balanced budget act
of 1997 expand the penalties for healthcare fraud including broader provisions
for the exclusion of providers from the medicare and medicaid programs further
under operation restore trust a major antifraud demonstration project the
office of inspector general of the us department of health and human services
in cooperation with other federal and state agencies has focused on the
activities of skilled nursing facilities home health agencies hospices and
durable medical equipment suppliers in certain states including california in

project has been

expanded to numerous other states and to additional providers including
providers of ancillary nursing home services

         the federal government has investigated some of our lessees for alleged
violations of medicare regulations one lessee vencor inc a longterm care
provider announced in august 2000 that it will enter into a fiveyear corporate
integrity agreement with the office of inspector general which will partially
resolve ongoing federal investigations concerning alleged quality of care
problems and billing irregularities at vencor facilities this corporate
integrity agreement will require vencor to implement a broad variety of controls
to ensure compliance with medicare regulations and will also require vencor to
develop a comprehensive plan to improve the quality of care furnished at its
facilities

         other lessees have been faced with whistleblower suits by former
employees alleging noncompliance with medicare rules and regulations for
instance the us department of justice recently joined a whistleblower suit
filed against integrated health services inc which alleges that the company
admitted and retained patients in its longterm care hospitals who did not
require acute care and billed medicare for these allegedly unnecessary services

         some medicare fiscal intermediaries private companies that contract
with the health care financing administrationhcfa to administer the medicare
program have also increased scrutiny of cost reports filed by longterm care
providers violations of such laws and regulations may jeopardize a borrowers
or lessees ability to operate a facility or to make rent and debt payments
thereby potentially adversely affecting us our lease arrangements with lessees
may also be subject to these fraud and abuse laws federal and state laws
governing illegal rebates and kickbacks regulate contingent or percentage rent
arrangements where our coinvestors are physicians or others in a position to
refer patients to the facilities although only limited interpretive or
enforcement guidance is available we have structured our rent arrangements in a
manner which we believe complies with such laws and regulations

         based upon information we have periodically received from our operators
over the terms of their respective leases and loans we believe that the
facilities in which we have investments are in substantial compliance with the
various regulatory requirements applicable to them although there can be no
assurance that the operators are in compliance or will remain in compliance in
the future

         licensure risks healthcare facilities must obtain licensure to
operate failure to obtain licensure or loss of licensure would prevent a
facility from operating these events could adversely affect the facility
operators ability to make rent and debt payments state and local laws also may
regulate expansion including the addition of new beds or services or
acquisition of medical equipment and occasionally the contraction of healthcare
facilities by requiring certificate of need or other similar approval programs
in addition healthcare facilities are subject to the americans with
disabilities act and building and safety codes which govern access to and
physical design requirements and building standards for facilities

         environmental matters a wide variety of federal state and local
environmental and occupational health and safety laws and regulations affect
healthcare facility operations under various federal state and local
environmental laws ordinances and regulations an owner of real property or a
secured lender such as us may be liable for the costs of removal or
remediation of hazardous or toxic substances at under or disposed of in
connection with such property as well as

                                      21
page

other potential costs relating to hazardous or toxic substances including
government fines and damages for injuries to persons and adjacent property
such laws often impose such liability without regard to whether the owner or
secured lender knew of or was responsible for the presence or disposal of such
substances and may be imposed on the owner or secured lender in connection with
the activities of an operator of the property the cost of any required
remediation removal fines or personal or property damages and the owners or
secured lenders liability therefore could exceed the value of the property
andor the assets of the owner or secured lender in addition the presence of
such substances or the failure to properly dispose of or remediate such
substances may adversely affect the owners ability to sell or rent such
property or to borrow using such property as collateral which in turn would
reduce our revenues

         although the mortgage loans that we provide and leases covering our
properties require the borrower and the lessee to indemnify us for certain
environmental liabilities the scope of such obligations may be limited and we
cannot assure that any such borrower or lessee would be able to fulfill its
indemnification obligations

         medicare and medicaid programs sources of revenue for lessees and
mortgagors may include the federal medicare program state medicaid programs
private insurance carriers healthcare service plans and health maintenance
organizations among others efforts to reduce costs by these payors will likely
continue which may result in reduced or slower growth in reimbursement for
certain services provided by some of our operators in addition the failure of
any of our operators to comply with various laws and regulations could
jeopardize their ability to continue participating in the medicare and medicaid
programs

         medicare payments for longterm and rehabilitative care are based on
allowable costs plus a return on equity for proprietary facilities medicare
payments to acute care hospitals for inpatient services are based on the
prospective payment system under the prospective payment system a hospital is
paid a prospectively established rate based on the category of the patients
diagnosis diagnostic related groups or drgs beginning in 1991 medicare
payments began to phasein the prospective payment system for capital related
inpatient costs over a period of years thus medicare reimbursement to
hospitals for capitalrelated inpatient costs began using a federal rate rather
than the costbased reimbursement system previously used drg rates are subject
to adjustment on an annual basis as part of the federal budget reconciliation
process the balanced budget act of 1997 expanded the prospective payment system
to include skilled nursing facilities home health agencies hospital outpatient
departments and rehabilitation hospitals see healthcare reform section and
further discussion below

         beginning in august 2000 the health care financing administration
implemented a prospective payment system for hospital outpatient services all
outpatient services paid under this new system are classified into groups called
ambulatory payment classifications apcs each apc has its own prospectively
established fixed payment rate depending upon the services provided hospitals
may be paid for more than one apc during a single patient encounter apc rates
are subject to adjustment on an annual basis

         medicaid programs generally pay for acute and rehabilitative care based
on reasonable costs at fixed rates longterm care facilities are generally
reimbursed using fixed daily rates both medicare and medicaid payments are
generally below retail rates for lesseeoperated facilities increasingly
states have introduced managed care contracting techniques in the administration
of

                                      22
page

medicaid programs such mechanisms could have the impact of reducing utilization
of and reimbursement to lesseeoperated facilities 

         third party payors in various states and areas base payments on costs
retail rates or increasingly negotiated rates negotiated rates can include
discounts from normal charges fixed daily rates and prepaid capitated rates

         skilled nursing facility prospective payment system up until july 1
1998 medicare and most state medicaid programs utilized a costbased
reimbursement system for skilled nursing facilities which reimbursed these
facilities for the reasonable direct and indirect allowable costs incurred in
providing routine services plus in certain states a return on equity subject
to certain cost ceilings these costs normally included allowances for
administrative and general costs as well as the costs of property and equipment
depreciation and interest fair rental allowance or rental expense in certain
states costbased reimbursement was typically subject to retrospective
adjustment through cost report settlement and for certain states payments made
to a facility on an interim basis that were subsequently determined to be less
than or in excess of allowable costs could be adjusted through future payments
to the affected facility and to other facilities owned by the same owner state
medicaid reimbursement programs varied as to the methodology used to determine
the level of allowable costs which were reimbursed to operators

         beginning on july 1 1998 the congressionally mandated prospective
payment system was implemented for skilled nursing facilities under the
prospective payment system skilled nursing facilities are paid a casemix
adjusted federal per diem rate for medicarecovered services provided by skilled
nursing facilities the per diem rate is calculated to cover routine service
costs ancillary costs and capitalrelated costs the phasedin implementation
of the prospective payment system for skilled nursing facilities began with the
first costreporting period beginning on or after july 1 1998 the prospective
payment system is expected to be fully implemented by july 1 2001 the effect
of the implementation of the prospective payment system on a particular skilled
nursing facility will vary in relation to the amount of revenue derived from
medicare patients for each skilled nursing facility

         skilled nursing facilities may need to restructure their operations to
accommodate the new medicare prospective payment system reimbursement in part
because of the uncertainty as to the effect of the prospective payment system on
skilled nursing facilities in november 1998 standard  poors placed many
skilled nursing facility companies on credit watch because of the potential
negative impact of the implementation of the prospective payment system on the
financial condition of skilled nursing facilities including the ability to make
interest and principal payments on outstanding borrowings the financial
condition of many longterm care providers worsened following implementation of
the medicare prospective payment system and a number of longterm care
providers filed for bankruptcy protection during 1999 and the first quarter of
2000 our tenants that have filed for chapter xi bankruptcy protection are sun
healthcare group integrated health services inc mariner postacute network
inc lenox healthcare inc texas health enterprises inc genesis health
ventures and vencor inc lenox healthcare inc and texas health enterprises
inc have both exited bankruptcy


         longterm care facilities longterm care facilities are regulated
primarily through the licensing of such facilities against a common background
established by federal law enacted as part of the omnibus budget reconciliation
act of 1987 regulatory authorities and licensing standards

                                      23
page

vary from state to state and in some instances from locality to locality these
standards are constantly reviewed and revised state agencies periodically
inspect facilities to determine whether they comply with state andor federal
regulations at which time deficiencies may be identified the facilities must
correct these deficiencies as a condition to continued licensing or
certification and participation in government reimbursement programs depending
on the nature of such deficiencies remedies can be routine or costly
similarly compliance with regulations which cover a broad range of areas such
as patients rights staff training quality of life and quality of resident
care may increase facility startup and operating costs

         in 1999 and 2000 congress increased funding for state health agencies
in order to allow state agencies that conduct skilled nursing facility
inspections to intensify medicare and medicaid regulatory enforcement efforts
the health care financing administration has instructed these state agencies to
increase the number of unannounced nursing home inspections and to investigate
consumer complaints about skilled nursing facilities promptly as a result of
these increased enforcement efforts some of our lessees may be subject to fines
and other penalties that could increase their operating costs

         acute care hospitals acute care hospitals are also subject to
extensive federal state and local regulation acute care hospitals undergo
periodic inspections regarding standards of medical care equipment and hygiene
as a condition of licensure various licenses and permits also are required for
purchasing and administering narcotics operating laboratories and pharmacies
and the use of radioactive materials and certain equipment each of our
facilities the operation of which requires accreditation is accredited by the
joint commission on accreditation of healthcare organizations such
accreditation may be a more costeffective and timeefficient method of meeting
requirements for continued licensing and for participation in government
sponsored provider programs

         acute care hospitals must comply with requirements for various forms of
utilization review in addition under the prospective payment system each
state must have a peer review organization carry out federally funded mandated
reviews of medicare patient admissions treatment and discharges in acute care
hospitals

         congregate care and assisted living facilities certain congregate care
and assisted living facilities are subject to federal state and local
licensure certification and inspection laws these laws regulate among other
matters the number of licensed beds the provision of services equipment
staffing and operating policies and procedures failure to comply with these
laws and regulations could result in the denial of reimbursement in a few states
and decertification from the medicaid program the imposition of fines
suspension or and in extreme cases the revocation of a facilitys license or
closure of a facility such actions may have an effect on the revenue of the
operators of properties owned by or mortgaged to us and therefore adversely
impact us

         physician group practice clinics physician group practice clinics are
subject to extensive federal state and local legislation and regulation every
state imposes licensing requirements on individual physicians and on facilities
and services operated by physicians in addition federal and state laws
regulate health maintenance organizations and other managed care organizations
with which physician groups may have contracts many states require regulatory
approval including certificates of need before establishing certain types of
physiciandirected clinics offering certain services or making expenditures in
excess of statutory thresholds for healthcare equipment

                                      24
page

facilities or programs in connection with the expansion of existing operations
and the entry into new markets physician clinics and affiliated practice groups
may become subject to compliance with additional regulation

         rehabilitation hospitals rehabilitation hospitals are subject to
extensive federal state and local legislation regulation inspection and
licensure requirements similar to those of acute care hospitals many states
have adopted a patients bill of rights which provides for certain higher
standards for patient care that are designed to decrease restrictions and
enhance dignity in treatment

                                      25

healthcare reform

         the healthcare industry has continually faced various challenges
including increased government and private payor pressure on healthcare
providers to control costs the migration of patients from acute care facilities
into extended care and home care settings and the vertical and horizontal
consolidation of healthcare providers the pressure to control healthcare costs
intensified during 1994 and 1995 as a result of the national healthcare reform
debate and continues as congress attempted to slow the rate of growth of federal
healthcare expenditures as part of its effort to balance the federal budget

         changes in the law new interpretations of existing laws and changes
in payment methodology may have a dramatic effect on the definition of
permissible or impermissible activities the relative costs associated with
doing business and the amount of reimbursement furnished by both government and
other thirdparty payors these changes may be applied retroactively the
ultimate timing or effect of legislative efforts cannot be predicted and may
impact us in different ways

         these changes include

         1      the adoption of the medicarechoice program which expands
                  medicare beneficiaries choices to include traditional
                  medicare feeforservice private feeforservice medical
                  savings accounts various managed care plans and provider
                  sponsored organizations among others

         2      the expansion and restriction of reimbursement for various
                  medicare benefits

         3      the adoption of a prospective payment system for skilled
                  nursing facilities home health agencies hospital outpatient
                  departments and rehabilitation hospitals

         4      the repeal of the boren amendment payment standard for
                  medicaid so that states have the exclusive authority to
                  determine provider rates and providers have no federal right
                  of action

         5      the reduction in medicare disproportionate share payments to
                  hospitals and

         6      the removal of the 150000000 limit on taxexempt bonds for
                  nonacute hospital capital projects

         the balanced budget act of 1997 signed by president clinton on august
5 1997 was designed to produce several billion dollars in net savings for
medicaid over the five years following enactment in addition the balanced
budget act repealed the boren amendment under which states were required to pay
longterm care providers including skilled nursing facilities rates that were
reasonable and adequate to meet the cost which must be incurred by efficiently
and economically operated facilities as a result of the repeal of the boren
amendment states are now required by the balanced budget act to do the
following with respect to skilled nursing facility rates

                                      26
page

        use a public process for determining rates
        publish proposed and final rates the methodologies underlying the
         rates and justifications for the rates and
        give methodologies and justifications

         when determining rates states are required to take into account the
situation of skilled nursing facilities that serve a disproportionate number of
lowincome patients with special needs the secretary of health and human
services is required to conduct a study concerning the effect of state
ratesetting methodologies on the access to and the quality of services provided
to medicaid beneficiaries and report the study results to congress the balanced
budget act also provides the federal government with expanded enforcement powers
to combat waste fraud and abuse in delivery of healthcare services though
applicable to payments for services furnished on or after october 1 1997 the
new requirements are not retroactive thus states that have not proposed
changes in their payment methods or standards or changes in rates for items and
services furnished on or after october 1 1997 need not immediately implement a
balanced budget act public approval process the balanced budget act of 1997
also strengthened the antifraud and abuse laws to provide for stiffer penalties
for fraud and abuse violations

         in november 1999 president clinton signed into law the medicare
medicaid and state childrens health insurance programs schip balanced
budget refinement act of 1999 budget refinement act which reduces some of
the reimbursement cutbacks enacted under the balanced budget act the budget
refinement act delayed implementation of costcutting measures and increased
payments to some sectors of the healthcare industry longterm care facilities
received increased payments under the budget refinement act disproportionate
share hospital payment cutbacks were lessened the budget refinement act
provided that the change to a prospective payment system for outpatient hospital
services must be budget neutral and not result in reduced reimbursement the
extent of the financial relief provided by the budget refinement act is
estimated to be 16 billion over five years

         continuing this trend president clinton signed the medicare medicaid
and schip benefits improvement and protection act of 2000 benefits improvement
act in december 2000 which provides for acrosstheboard medicare and
medicaid payment increases for most healthcare providers overall passage of
the benefits improvement act is expected to result in approximately 35 billion
in additional reimbursement for providers over the next five years in
particular skilled nursing facility payments are expected to increase by an
average of 32 percent in 2001 additionally the benefits improvement act
extended the moratorium on implementation of the cap for outpatient therapy
services throughout 2002 payments for home health services hospice services
and longterm care hospital services will also increase under the provisions of
the benefits improvement act

         other federal initiatives will result in greater operational
expenditures for healthcare providers for instance the health insurance
portability and accountability act of 1996 requires a significant overhaul of
healthcare information systems to protect individual medical information and to
standardize formatting of healthcare claims in november 1999 the department of
health and human services released proposed regulations to protect the
confidentiality of individual health information final privacy regulations were
released in december 2000 while the privacy regulations are likely to become
effective in early 2001 the us department of health and human

                                      27
page

services will delay enforcement of the privacy regulations until at least
february 2003 the federal government has estimated that the united states
healthcare industry will spend approximately 18 billion over a tenyear period
in order to achieve compliance with these new privacy requirements

         in august 2000 the us department of health and human services also
released final regulations that delineated uniform national standards for the
electronic exchange of medical information and filing of claims healthcare
providers must comply with these regulations by october 2002 the federal
government estimates that compliance will cost healthcare providers
approximately 35 billion however the federal government has predicted that
implementation of these uniform standards will help to speed conversion from
manual to electronic billing systems resulting in cost savings of approximately
20 billion over the next decade for healthcare providers

         in addition to the reforms enacted and considered by congress from time
to time state legislatures periodically consider various healthcare reform
proposals congress and state legislatures can be expected to continue to review
and assess alternative healthcare delivery systems new regulatory enforcement
initiatives and new payment methodologies public debate of these issues can be
expected to continue in the future there are numerous initiatives at the
federal and state levels for comprehensive reforms affecting the payment for and
delivery of healthcare services changes in the law new interpretations of
existing laws and changes in payment methodology and enforcement priorities may
have a dramatic effect on the definition of permissible or impermissible
activities the relative costs associated with doing business and the amount of
reimbursement by both government and other thirdparty payors these changes may
be applied retroactively the ultimate timing or effect of legislative efforts
cannot be predicted and may impact us in different ways

         in 1998 health expenditures in the united states amounted to 11
trillion representing 135 percent of gross domestic product the health care
financing administration reported that 1998 spending for healthcare continued a
fiveyear trend of low growth to below six percent annually but reflected the
highest annual percentage increase since 1993 also for the first time in a
decade public spending grew more slowly than private healthcare spending the
primary reason for the slow growth in public spending was medicare which was
significantly affected by the adoption of reimbursement restriction measures in
the balanced budget act of 1997 fraud savings also contributed because
economic growth generally matched growth in healthcare spending since 1993 the
healthcare share of gross domestic product has remained roughly the same since
1993 we believe that government and private efforts to contain or reduce
healthcare costs will continue to some extent these trends are likely to lead
to reduced or slower growth in reimbursement for certain services provided by
some of our lessees and mortgagors we believe that the vast nature of the
healthcare industry the financial strength and operating flexibility of our
operators and the diversity of our portfolio will mitigate the impact of any
such diminution in reimbursements however we cannot predict whether any of the
above proposals or any other proposals will be adopted and if adopted no
assurance can be given that the implementation of such reforms will not have a
material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations

                                      28

objectives and policies

         we are organized to invest in incomeproducing healthcare related
facilities in evaluating potential investments we consider such factors as

   1   the geographic area type of property and demographic profile
   2   the location construction quality condition and design of the
         property
   3   the current and anticipated cash flow and its adequacy to meet
         operational needs and lease obligations and to provide a competitive
         market return on equity to our investors
   4   the potential for capital appreciation if any
   5   the growth tax and regulatory environment of the communities in which
         the properties are located
   6   occupancy and demand for similar health facilities in the same or
         nearby communities
   7   an adequate mix of private and government sponsored patients
   8   potential alternative uses of the facilities and
   9   prospects for liquidity through financing or refinancing

         there are no limitations on the percentage of our total assets that may
be invested in any one property or partnership the investment committee of the
board of directors may establish limitations as it deems appropriate from time
to time no limits have been set on the number of properties in which we will
seek to invest or on the concentration of investments in any one facility or
any one city or state we acquire our investments primarily for income

         at december 31 2000 we had three series of preferred stock and one
class of debt securities which are senior to the common stock we may in the
future issue additional debt or equity securities which will be senior to the
common stock we have authority to offer shares of our capital stock in exchange
for investments which conform to our standards and to repurchase or otherwise
acquire our shares or other securities

         we may incur additional indebtedness when in the opinion of our
management and directors it is advisable for shortterm purposes we from time
to time negotiate lines of credit or arrange for other shortterm borrowings
from banks or otherwise we arrange for longterm borrowings through public
offerings or from institutional investors

         in addition we may incur additional mortgage indebtedness on real
estate which we have acquired through purchase foreclosure or otherwise where
leverage is present on terms deemed favorable we invest in properties subject
to existing loans or secured by mortgages deeds of trust or similar liens on
the properties we also may obtain nonrecourse or other mortgage financing on
unleveraged properties in which we have invested or may refinance properties
acquired on a leveraged basis

         on june 20 2000 we adopted a stockholder rights plan and declared a
dividend of one preferred share purchase right for each outstanding share of our
common stock the rights will become exercisable if a person or group of
affiliated or associated persons has acquired or obtained the right to acquire
beneficial ownership of 15 of more of our common stock or following the
commencement or announcement of an intention to make a tender offer or exchange
offer the consummation of which would result in the beneficial ownership by a
person or group of 15 or

                                      29

more of our common stock after the rights become exercisable each right will
entitle the holder to purchase from us one onehundredth 1100th of a share of
series d junior participating preferred stock at a price of 95 per one one
hundredth 1100th of a preferred share subject to certain antidilution
adjustments the rights will at no time have any voting rights

         each series d preferred share purchasable upon exercise of the rights
will be entitled when as and if declared to a minimum preferential quarterly
dividend payment of 100 per share but will be entitled to an aggregate
dividend of 100 times the dividend if any declare per common share in the
event our liquidation dissolution or winding up the holders of the series d
preferred shares will be entitled to a preferential liquidation payment of 100
per share plus any accrued but unpaid dividends but will be entitled to an
aggregate payment of 100 times the payment made per common share each series d
preferred share will have 100 votes and will vote together with our common
stock finally in the event of any merger consolidation or other transaction
in which share of our common stock are exchanged each series d preferred share
will be entitled to receive 100 times the amount received per share of common
stock series d preferred shares will not be redeemable the rights are
protected by customary antidilution provisions because of the nature of the
preferred shares dividend liquidation and voting rights the value of one
onehundredth of a preferred share purchasable upon exercise of each right
should approximate the value of one common share

         under certain circumstances each holder of a right other than rights
that are or were acquired or beneficially owned by a person or group acquiring
15 or more which rights will thereafter be void will have the right to
receive upon exercise that number of common shares having a market value of two
times the then current purchase price of one right in the event that after a
person acquired 15 or more of our common stock we were acquired in a merger or
other business combination transaction or more than 50 of our assets or earning
power were sold each holder of a right shall have the right to receive upon
the exercise thereof at the then current purchase price of the right that
number of shares of common stock of the acquiring company which at the time of
such transaction would have a market value of two times the then current
purchase price of one right

         the rights may be redeemed by the board of directors at any time prior
to the time a person or group acquires 15 or more of our common stock

         the rights will expire on july 27 2010 unless earlier redeemed
exchanged or terminated the bank of new york is the rights agent

         the rights are designed to assure that all of our stockholders receive
fair and equal treatment in the event of any proposed takeover of us and to
guard against partial tender offers open market accumulations and other abusive
tactics to gain control of us without paying all stockholders a control premium
the rights will cause substantial dilution to a person or group that acquires
15 or more of our stock on terms not approved by our board of directors the
rights should not interfere with any merger or other business combination
approved by the board of directors at any time prior to the first date that a
person or group acquires 15 or more of our common stock

         we will not without the prior approval of a majority of directors
acquire from or sell to any director officer or employee of hcpi or any
affiliate thereof as the case may be any of our assets or other property

an equity value net of assumed debt of approximately 67 million in exchange
for this capital contribution the contributing limited partnerships designated
their constituent partners to receive approximately 39 million in cash and
89452 nonmanaging member units of hcpiindiana representing a minority
interest in hcpiindiana hcpiindiana also issued 781213 managing member
units to us in exchange for a capital contribution of approximately 246
million

         beginning on december 4 1999 the nonmanaging member units could be
exchanged for common stock or at our option for cash the nonmanaging member
units are exchangeable for common stock on a one for one basis subject to
certain adjustments such as stock splits and reclassifications or for an
amount of cash equal to the thencurrent market value of the shares of common
stock into which the nonmanaging member units may be exchanged

         hcpiindiana relied on the exemption provided by section 42 of the
securities act in connection with the issuance and sale of the nonmanaging
member units during the first quarter of 2000 we registered 89452 shares of
our common stock for issuance from time to time in exchange for units

five additional medical office buildings during 1999 two of the five buildings
were contributed to hcpiutah and the contributing entities received 48212
nonmanaging member units of hcpiutah and 707663 managing member units were
issued to us in addition hcpi and hcpiutah agreed with boyer that it would
not acquire the medical office building known as old mill the amended and
restated limited liability company agreement of hcpiutah the agreement
provides that only we are authorized to act on behalf of hcpiutah and that we
have responsibility for the management of its business in accordance with the
agreement the contributing entities also received an additional 29688 non
managing member units as a result of a stepup in value of one of the buildings
during 2000 hcpiutah determined that 505881 managing member units previously
recorded and issued to hcpi during 1999 should have been recorded as a loan from
hcpi to retire existing debt of hcpiutah consequently hcpiutah redesignated
these units as a loan from hcpi which is secured by hcpiutah real estate
assets

         the nonmanaging member units issued in connection with the initial
closing became exchangeable for common stock on january 25 2000 and the

         condition and results of operations

general

      health care property investors inc including its whollyowned
subsidiaries and affiliated joint ventures hcpi generally acquires healthcare
facilities and leases them on a longterm basis to healthcare providers hcpi
also leases medical office space to providers and physicians on a shorter term
basis on a more limited basis we provide mortgage financing on healthcare
facilities as of december 31 2000 our portfolio of properties including
equity investments consisted of 413 facilities located in 43 states these
facilities are comprised of 172 longterm care facilities 86 congregate care
and assisted living facilities 80 medical office buildings 44 physician group
practice clinics 22 acute care hospitals and nine freestanding rehabilitation
facilities our gross investment in the properties which includes joint venture
acquisitions was approximately 2593000000 at december 31 2000

      on november 4 1999 american health properties inc ahe merged with
and into hcpi in a stockforstock transaction approved by the stockholders of
both companies with hcpi being the surviving corporation ahe was a real estate
investment trust specializing in healthcare facilities with a portfolio of 72
healthcare properties in 22 states under the terms of the merger agreement
each share of ahe common stock was converted into the right to receive 078
share of hcpis common stock and ahes 860 cumulative redeemable preferred
stock series b was converted into shares of hcpis 860 series c cumulative
redeemable preferred stock the merger resulted in the issuance of 19430115
shares of hcpis common stock and 4000000 depositary shares of hcpis series c
cumulative redeemable preferred stock additionally we assumed ahes debt
comprised of 220 million of senior notes 56 million of mortgage debt and paid
71 million in cash to replace their revolving line of credit upon consummation
of the merger the transaction was treated as a purchase for financial
accounting purposes and accordingly the operating results of ahe have been
included in our consolidated financial statements effective as of november 4
1999

      the main focus of operations for 2000 centered upon the integration of the
acquisition of american health properties and selling under utilized
investments and those of less strategic value additionally lease renewals
property management consolidation mortgage financing and the issues created as
a result of nursing home operators reorganizing rounded out the accomplishments
of a difficult year

charge as a result of the summerville equity investment writeoff see note 5
to the consolidated financial statements also included is a 2751000 or

value in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 121 of
four physician clinics that are expected to be sold during 2001 see note 4 to
the consolidated financial statements the increase in net income applicable to
common shares is primarily the result of 1999 acquisition activity most of
which is attributable to the acquisition of american health properties
portfolio

         rental income attributable to triple net leases for the year ended
december 31 2000 increased 578 or 83164000 to 227012000 rental income
attributable to managed properties for the year ended december 31 2000
increased 432 or 24096000 to 79818000 with a related increase in managed
properties operating expenses of 521 or 9498000 to 27738000 these
increases were generated primarily from 1999 acquisition activity most of which
is related to the acquisition of american health properties portfolio interest
and other income for the year ended december 31 2000 decreased 89 or
2246000 to 22977000 primarily as a result of the divestiture during mid
1999 of certain partnership interests from which we were receiving income

         interest expense for the year ended december 31 2000 increased 484
or 28289000 to 86747000 the increase is primarily the result of an
increase in borrowings used to fund the acquisitions made during 1999 and the
interest related to the debt assumed in the merger with american health
properties all described in more detail below in the liquidity and capital
resources section the increase in real estate depreciation of 621 or
27801000 to 72590000 for the year ended december 31 2000 is the direct
result of the new investments made during 1999 including the merger with
american health properties as well as the write down of the four facilities held
for sale discussed above

         we believe that funds from operations ffo is the most important
supplemental measure of operating performance for a real estate investment
trust see note 12 to the consolidated financial statements ffo for the year
ended december 31 2000 increased 496 or 56824000 to 171344000 the
increase is mainly attributable to increases in rental income as offset by
increases in interest expense and managed properties operating expenses which
are discussed in more detail above

the corresponding period in 1998 included in net income applicable to common
shares and earnings per share on a diluted basis for the years ended december
31 1999 and 1998 is a gain on sale of real estate properties of 10303000 or
027 per share and 14053000 or 042 per share respectively

these

                                      38

increases were generated by a full year of rents on 429000000 of property
acquisitions made in 1998 rents on 146000000 of new property acquisitions
made in 1999 and rents on properties acquired in the merger with ahe the 1999
acquisition activity most of which is related to the acquisition of ahes
portfolio in the fourth quarter of 1999 represents a significant increase over
the acquisition activity of prior years

         interest expense for the year ended december 31 1999 increased
21072000 to 58458000 the increase is primarily the result of a full year
of interest on the june 1998 issuance of mandatory par put remarketed securities
mopprs senior debt an increase in shortterm borrowings used to fund
investments made during 1998 and 1999 and 343000000 in debt assumed in the
merger with ahe all described in more detail below in the liquidity and
capital resources section the increase in real estate depreciation of

related to the new investments discussed above

         ffo for the year ended december 31 1999 increased by 18265000 to
114520000 the increase is mainly attributable to increases in rental income

stock issuance of longterm debt assumption of mortgage debt the mortgaging

in 2000 management believes that our liquidity and sources of capital are
adequate to finance our operations future investments in additional facilities
will be dependent on availability of cost effective sources of capital

8 2000 at a gain of 274000 the balance of 68910000 was paid off on the
due date as discussed earlier proceeds of the 83 million secured debt
financing were utilized to fund the payoff

revolving lines of credit

         we have two revolving lines of credit one for 103000000 that was
renewed recently and now expires on november 2 2001 and one for 207000000
that expires on november 3 2003 as of december 31 2000 we had 102000000
available on these lines of credit

retained cash flows

         since our inception in may 1985 we have recorded approximately
976333000 in ffo of this amount we have distributed a total of 817451000
to stockholders as dividends on common stock we have retained the balance of
158882000 and used it as an additional source of capital

         on november 20 2000 we paid a dividend of 075 per common share or
38222000 in the aggregate total dividends paid on common stock during the
year ended december 31 2000 as a percentage of ffo was 876 during the
first quarter of 2001 we declared and paid a dividend of 076 per common share
or approximately 38696000 in the aggregate

available financing sources

         as of february 2001 we had 372000000 available for future financing
of debt and equity securities under a shelf registration statement filed with

85000000 available under mtn senior debt programs these amounts may be
issued from time to time in the future based on our needs and then existing
market conditions

letters of credit

         at december 31 2000 we held approximately 6719000 in depository
accounts and 52672000 in irrevocable letters of credit from commercial banks
to secure the obligations of many lessees lease and borrowers loan
obligations we may draw upon the letters of credit or depository accounts if
there are any defaults under the leases andor loans amounts available under

facility rollovers

         we have concluded a significant number of facility rollover
transactions on properties that have been under longterm leases and mortgages
facility rollover transactions principally include lease renewals and
renegotiations exchanges sales of properties and to a lesser extent payoffs
on mortgage receivables the annualized impact on a pro forma basis as if the
facility rollover transactions had occurred on january 1 of each year was to
decrease ffo in each of the years 1998 through 2000 by 3100000 3400000
and 1300000 respectively total rollovers were 44 facilities 26 facilities
and 37 facilities in each of the years 1998 through 2000

         for the years ending december 31 2001 and 2002 we have 48 facilities
and six facilities in the triple net lease portfolio respectively that are
subject to lease expiration and mortgage maturities including lease expirations
in the managed portfolio total company revenue subject to lease expirations and
mortgage maturities are 53 for 2001 and 61 for 2002

         during 1997 we reached agreement with tenet healthcare corporation
tenet the holder of substantially all of the option rights under our leases
with vencor inc vencor whereby tenet agreed to waive renewal and purchase
options and related rights of first refusal on up to 51 facilities as part of
these agreements we have the right to continue to own the facilities we paid
tenet 5000000 in cash accelerated the purchase option on one acute care
hospital leased to tenet and reduced tenets guarantees on the facilities
leased to vencor leases on 21 of those 51 facilities had expiration dates
through december 31 2000 we have increased rents on five of the facilities
with leases that expired during 1998 and we believe we will be able to increase
rents on other facilities whose lease terms expire in 2001 however there can
be no assurance that we will be able to realize any increased rents on future
rollovers

troubled longterm care and assisted living operators

         the financial weakness of operators in the longterm care and assisted
living sectors including the bankruptcies of certain of our tenants may result
in uncertainties in our ability to continue to realize the full benefit of such
operators leases we cannot assure you that the bankruptcies of certain long
term care operators and the trouble experienced by assisted living operators
would not have a material adverse effect on our net income ffo or the market
value of our common stock see note 5 to the consolidated financial
statements

year 2000 issue

         the year 2000 issue was the result of widely used computer programs
that identify the year by two digits rather than by four it was believed that
continued use of these programs may result in widespread computergenerated
malfunctions and miscalculations beginning in the year 2000 when the digits
00 are interpreted as 1900 it was believed that those miscalculations could
cause disruption of operations including the temporary inability to process
transactions such as invoices for payment preparing for year 2000 had been a
high priority for us we successfully completed our year 2000 preparedness
including upgrading replacing and testing our it systems the cost of such
preparations was not material and to date we have not seen any adverse effect on
our results of operations from the year 2000 issue

item 7a          disclosures about market risk

         we are exposed to market risks related to fluctuations in interest
rates on our mortgage loans receivable and on our debt instruments

         we provide mortgage loans to operators of healthcare facilities in the
normal course of business all of the mortgage loans receivable have fixed
interest rates or interest rates with periodic fixed increases therefore the
mortgage loans receivable are all considered to be fixed rate loans and the
current interest rate the lowest rate is used in the computation of market
risk provided in the table below if material

         we may assume mortgage notes payable already in place as part of an
acquisition transaction currently we have two mortgage notes payable with
variable interest rates and the remaining mortgage notes payable have fixed
interest rates or interest rates with fixed periodic

                                      43
page

increases our senior notes are at fixed rates the variable rate loans are at
interest rates below the current prime rate of 85 and fluctuations are tied
to the prime rate or to a rate currently below the prime rate

         fluctuation in the interest rate environment will not affect our future
earnings and cash flows on our fixed rate debt until that debt matures and must
be replaced or refinanced interest rate changes will affect the fair value of
the fixed rate instruments conversely changes in interest rates on variable
rate debt would change our future earnings and cash flows but not affect the
fair value on those instruments assuming a one percentage point increase in the
interest rate related to the variable rate debt including the mortgage notes
payable and the bank lines of credit and assuming no change in the outstanding
balance as of year end interest expense for 2000 would increase by
approximately 2101000

         the principal amount and the average interest rates for the mortgage
loans receivable and debt categorized by the final maturity dates is presented
in the table below the fair value estimates for the mortgage loans receivable
are based on the estimates of management and on rates currently prevailing for
comparable loans the fair market value estimates for debt securities are based
on discounting future cash flows utilizing current rates offered to us for debt
of the same type and remaining maturity

         insofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under the securities
act of 1933 may be permitted to directors officers and controlling persons of
the registrant pursuant to the foregoing provisions or otherwise the
registrant has been advised that in the opinion of the securities and exchange
commission such indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the
securities act of 1933 and is therefore unenforceable in the event that a
claim for indemnification against such liabilities other than the payment by
the registrant of expenses incurred or paid by a director officer or
controlling person of the registrant in the successful defense of any action
suit or proceeding is asserted by such director officer or controlling person
in connection with the securities being registered the registrant will unless
in the opinion of its counsel the matter has been settled by controlling
precedent submit to a court of appropriate jurisdiction the question whether
such indemnification by it is against public policy expressed in the securities
act of 1933 and will be governed by the final adjudication of such issue

investments in real estate for potential impairment by comparing its investment
to the expected future cash flows to be generated from the properties if such
impairments were to occur hcpi would write down its investment in the property
to estimated market value hcpi has provided accelerated depreciation on certain
of its investments based primarily on an estimation of net realizable value of
such investments at the end of the primary lease terms acquisition development
and construction arrangements are accounted for as real estate investmentsjoint
ventures or loans based on the characteristics of the arrangements

         certain properties have been subleased or assigned to other operators
but with the original lessee remaining liable on the leases the investment and

1 2 and 4 in 2000 1999 and 1998 respectively

vencor

         on may 1 1998 vencor completed a spinoff transaction to become two
publicly held entities  ventas inc a reit and vencor a healthcare
operating company on september 13 1999 vencor filed for bankruptcy
protection hcpi has recourse to ventas inc and tenet healthcare corporation
for most of the obligations payable by vencor under its leases until the third
quarter of 2001 tenet is one of the nations largest healthcare services
companies providing a broad range of services through the ownership and
management of healthcare facilities the bankruptcy court confirmed vencors
plan of reorganization in march 2001

         its plan proposes the assumption of all of our leased facilities
including nine subleased facilities at december 31 2000 the assumption of
our leases would mean the continued performance of all vencors obligations
under the leases including all amounts owing prior to vencors filing date
vencor has paid most of these prepetition amounts and has continued to remain
current on its rent during its bankruptcy proceedings

                                      f14

         almost all of our vencor facilities have leases which expire in 2001
negotiations are in progress on the 23 facilities that would remain on new
leases with vencor with definitive agreements in place on four of nine
subleased facilities with current operators progress has been made for current
operators to retain operations on most of the remaining five subleased
facilities it is anticipated that a net rent increase will result from
negotiation with vencor and others for the 32 facilities discussed in this
paragraph

         based upon public reports for the three months ended september 30
2000 vencor had revenue of approximately 717 million and a net loss of
approximately 27 million for the nine months ended september 30 2000 vencor
had revenue of approximately 21 billion and a net loss of approximately 48
million based upon public reports ventas revenue and net income for the nine
months ended september 30 2000 were approximately 180 million and 18 million
respectively as of september 30 2000 ventas had total assets of 10 billion
and a stockholders deficit of 14 million

troubled longterm care and assisted living operators

         the financial condition of many longterm care providers in part due
to the implementation of the medicare prospective payment system resulted in
several longterm care provider lessees filing for chapter xi bankruptcy
protection during late 1999 and early 2000 lessees other than vencor that
filed for bankruptcy and their respective percentage of the companys annualized
revenue are sun healthcare 11 integrated health services 05 genesis health
ventures 05 mariner post acute network 04 lenox healthcare 03 and texas
health enterprises 02 the lessees in bankruptcy were current on all rents as
of december 31 2000 with the exception of minor prepetition receivables which
we believe will generally be payable once the plans of reorganization are
confirmed lenox healthcare and texas health enterprises have both exited
bankruptcy

         the assisted living industry from which the company derives 142 of
its revenue has experienced overbuilding in a number of areas and slower
fillup rates than were originally forecast this has required certain operators
to raise additional capital to sustain operations during fillup periods
additional capital may be required during 2001 however these factors have
stemmed further development activity which should allow improved fillup of
existing facilities and improvement in industry census

         the companys management recorded a complete writeoff of a 2000000
equity investment in summerville senior living ssl an assisted living
company although this investment represents less than 01 of gross real estate
investment and is outside the normal investment strategy of the company the
writeoff reduces net income see impairment of equity investment and reduces
reported ffo see note 12 for a definition of ffo no income has been recorded
on this equity investment in addition to the equity investment the company has
loaned 13500000 to ssl with ten leased facilities in california as collateral
and owns five facilities that are leased to ssl revenue from ssl equals
approximately 15 of the companys total revenue the 1200000 letter of
credit provided in connection with the five facility leases and the loan
discussed previously to ssl exceeds unpaid rents and interest due from them

         we cannot assure you that the bankruptcies of certain longterm care
operators and the trouble experienced by assisted living operators would not
have a material adverse effect on our net income ffo or the market value of our
common stock

         hcpi has minor equity interests including warrants at nominal values
in seven private operators of longterm care and assisted living facilities and
has invested 22383000 in additional amounts in the form of mortgages and
unsecured loans 63814000 in operating facilities and unfunded investing
commitments of 1771000 to the same operators as of december 31 2000

6      investments in joint ventures

         hcpi has an 80 interest in five joint ventures that lease six
longterm care facilities and a 4550 interest in four joint ventures that

12   funds from operations

       hcpi believes that funds from operations ffo is the most important
supplemental measure of operating performance for a real estate investment
trust because the historical cost accounting convention used for real estate
assets requires straightline depreciation except on land such accounting
presentation implies that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably
over time since real estate values instead have historically risen and fallen
with market conditions presentations of operating results for a real estate
investment trust that uses

historical cost accounting for depreciation could be less informative the term
ffo was designed by the real estate investment trust industry to address this
problem

       hcpi adopted the definition of ffo prescribed by the national association
of real estate investment trusts nareit ffo is defined as net income
applicable to common shares computed in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles excluding gains or losses from debt restructuring and
sales of property plus real estate depreciation and real estate related
amortization and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint
ventures adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures are
calculated to reflect ffo on the same basis

       ffo does not represent cash generated from operating activities in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles is not necessarily
indicative of cash available to fund cash needs and should not be considered as
an alternative to net income ffo as defined by hcpi may not be comparable to
similarly entitled items reported by other real estate investment trusts that do
not define it exactly as the nareit definition

       below are summaries of the calculation of ffo for the years ended
december 31 2000 1999 and 1998 all amounts in thousands

17   new pronouncements

       in june 1998 the financial accounting standards board issued statement
of financial accounting standards no 133 accounting for derivative instruments
and hedging activities the statement establishes accounting and reporting
standards requiring that every derivative instrument including certain
derivative instruments embedded in other contracts be recorded in the balance
sheet as either an asset or liability measured at its fair value the statement
requires that changes in the derivatives fair value be recognized currently in
earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met statement 133 is
effective for fiscal years beginning after june 15 2000 although earlier
implementation is allowed the effect of adopting statement 133 is not expected
to be material

       during 2000 the securities and exchange commission sec released staff
accounting bulletin no 101 sab 101 revenue recognition in financial
statements the company has adopted this accounting pronouncement as required by
the sec during the quarter ended december 31 2000 sab 101 had a minor impact
in reducing income by 300000 in the companys results of operations for the
year ended december 31 2000

       under sab 101 the company is required to defer income recognition of
additional rents that are based on facility revenue increases until an annual
rather than quarterly contractual facility revenue hurdle is exceeded due to
the companys current lease structures sab 101 will delay the recognition of
additional rents from the first quarter of a year to subsequent quarters of the
year if the company had adopted this pronouncement as of january 1 2000 the
quarterly results for 2000 would be altered as follows

     quarter ended december 31 2000       300000                 001


       rents affected by sab 101 generally have been received in cash ahead of
what sab 101 permits for income recognition and in most cases the annual
revenue hurdles have been exceeded for many years because of the stability of
revenue streams in the companys hospital facilities the company previously
followed the practice of estimating and applying rents ratably throughout each
of the quarters

       it is anticipated that the sab 101 standard will create volatility in the
companys quarterly earnings while there should be minimal effect on the
companys annual earnings and ffo
