unless the context requires otherwise references in this report to “old dominion” the “company” “we” “us” and “our” refer to old dominion freight line inc

overview

we are one of the largest north american lessthantruckload “ltl” motor carriers we provide regional interregional and national ltl services through a single integrated unionfree organization our service offerings which include expedited transportation are provided through an expansive network of service centers located throughout the continental united states through strategic alliances we also provide ltl services throughout north america in addition to our core ltl services we offer a range of valueadded services including container drayage truckload brokerage and supply chain consulting more than 98 of our revenue has historically been derived from transporting ltl shipments for our customers whose demand for our services is generally tied to industrial production and the overall health of the us domestic economy

we have increased our revenue and customer base over the past ten years primarily through organic market share growth our infrastructure allows us to provide nextday and secondday service through each of our regions covering the continental united states in addition to numerous service center renovations expansions and relocations of existing service centers we opened 7 25 and 35 new service centers over the past one five and ten years respectively for a total of 251 service centers at december 31 2021 we believe these expansions produced increased capacity within our service center network and provide us with opportunities for future growth

we believe the growth in demand for our services can be attributed to our ability to consistently provide a superior level of customer service at a fair price which allows our customers to meet their supply chain needs our integrated structure allows us to offer our customers consistent highquality service from origin to destination and we believe our operating structure and proprietary information systems enable us to efficiently manage our operating costs our services are complemented by our technological capabilities which we believe improve the efficiency of our operations while also empowering our customers to manage their individual shipping needs

we were founded in 1934 and incorporated in virginia in 1950 our principal executive offices are located at 500 old dominion way thomasville north carolina 27360

our industry

trucking companies provide transportation services to virtually every industry operating in the united states and generally offer higher levels of reliability and faster transit times than other surface transportation options the trucking industry is comprised principally of two types of motor carriers ltl and truckload ltl freight carriers typically pick up multiple shipments from multiple customers on a single truck the ltl freight is then routed through a network of service centers where the freight may be transferred to other trucks with similar destinations ltl motor carriers generally require a more expansive network of local pickup and delivery “pd” service centers as well as larger breakbulk or hub facilities in contrast truckload carriers generally dedicate an entire truck to one customer from origin to destination

 

 

significant capital is required to create and maintain a network of service centers and a fleet of tractors and trailers the high fixed costs and capital spending requirements for ltl motor carriers make it difficult for new startup or small operators to effectively compete with established carriers in addition successful ltl motor carriers generally employ and regularly update a high level of technologybased systems and processes that provide information to customers and help reduce operating costs 

the american trucking associations reported total transportation revenue in the united states of 9112 billion in 2020 which included approximately 411 billion for the ltl industry based on information reported in transport topics the ltl industry is highly competitive on the basis of service and price and has consolidated significantly since the industry was deregulated in 1980 the largest 5 and 10 ltl motor carriers accounted for approximately 58 and 83 respectively of the domestic ltl market in 2020 we believe consolidation in our industry will continue due to increased customer demand for transportation providers that can offer both regional and national service as well as other complementary valueadded services

competition

the transportation and logistics industry is intensely competitive and highly fragmented we compete with regional interregional and national ltl carriers and to a lesser extent with truckload carriers small package carriers airfreight carriers and railroads we also compete with and provide transportation services to thirdparty logistics providers that determine both the mode of transportation and the carrier some of our competitors may have a broader global network and a wider range of services than we do competition in our industry is based primarily on service price available capacity and business relationships we believe we are able to gain market share by expanding our capacity in the united states and providing highquality service at a fair price

throughout our organization we continuously seek to improve customer service by among other things maximizing ontime performance and minimizing cargo claims we believe our transit times are generally faster and more reliable than those of our principal national competitors in part because of our more efficient service center network use of team drivers and proprietary technology in addition we provide greater geographic coverage than most of our regional competitors our diversified mix and scope of regional interregional and national ltl service combined with our valueadded service offerings enables us to provide our customers with a single source to meet their shipping and logistics needs we believe the combination of these factors provides us with a distinct advantage over most of our competitors

we utilize flexible scheduling and train our employees to perform multiple tasks which we believe allows us to achieve greater productivity and higher levels of customer service than our competitors we believe our focus on employee communication continued education development and motivation strengthens the relationships and trust among our employees

service center operations

at december 31 2021 we operated 251 service center locations of which we owned 227 and leased 24 our service centers are responsible for the pickup and delivery of freight within their local service area each night our service centers load outbound freight for transport to our other service centers for delivery all inbound freight received by the service center in the evening or during the night is generally scheduled for local delivery the next business day unless a customer requests a different delivery schedule our management reviews the productivity and service performance of each service center on a daily basis to ensure quality service and efficient operations our network includes major breakbulk facilities as well as various other service centers that are used for additional limited breakbulk activity in order to serve our nextday markets our service centers are strategically located throughout the country so that we can provide the highest quality service and minimize freight rehandling costs

although we have established primary responsibility for customer service at the local service center level our customers may access information and initiate transactions through our centralized customer service department located at our corporate office or through other electronic gateways our systems allow us to offer our customers access to information such as freight tracking shipping documents rate quotes rate databases and account activity these centralized systems and our customer service department provide our customers with a single point of contact to access information across all areas of our operations and for each of our service offerings

linehaul transportation

linehaul dispatchers control the movement of freight between service centers through integrated freight movement systems we also utilize loadplanning software to optimize efficiencies in our linehaul operations our management team monitors freight movements transit times load factors and many other productivity measurements to help ensure that we maintain our high levels of service and efficiency

we utilize scheduled routes and additional linehaul dispatches as necessary to meet our published transit times in addition we gain efficiency through the use of twin 28foot trailers in our linehaul operations the use of twin 28foot trailers permits us to transport freight directly from its point of origin to destination with minimal unloading and reloading which also reduces our exposure 

 

 

to potential cargo loss and damage expenses we utilize longcombination vehicles such as triple 28foot trailers and combinations of 48foot and 28foot trailers in states where permitted twin trailers and longcombination vehicles permit more freight to be transported behind a tractor than could otherwise be transported by one trailer 

tractors trailers and maintenance

at december 31 2021 we owned 10403 tractors we generally use new tractors in linehaul operations for approximately three to five years and then transfer those tractors to pd operations for the remainder of their useful lives in many of our service centers tractors perform pd functions during the day and linehaul functions at night to maximize tractor utilization

the table below reflects as of december 31 2021 the average age of our tractors and trailers



we develop certain specifications for tractors and trailers and then negotiate the production and purchase of this equipment with several manufacturers these purchases are planned well in advance of anticipated delivery dates in order to accommodate manufacturers’ production schedules we generally believe there is sufficient capacity among suppliers to help ensure an uninterrupted supply of equipment to support our operations supply chain challenges have impacted our equipment manufacturers during 2021 and may continue to impact them during 2022 we will continue to use older equipment that would have otherwise been replaced based on our normal equipment cycle to help ensure that we have adequate capacity to support anticipated growth we will also continue to utilize purchased transportation as needed in order to support the capacity of our workforce and equipment needs

the table below sets forth our capital expenditures for tractors and trailers for the years ended december 31 2021 and 2020 for more information concerning our capital expenditures see item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations – liquidity and capital resources” in this report



at december 31 2021 we operated 43 fleet maintenance centers at strategic service center locations throughout our network these fleet maintenance centers are equipped to perform routine and preventive maintenance and repairs on our equipment

we adhere to established maintenance policies and procedures to help ensure our fleet is properly maintained tractors are routed to appropriate maintenance facilities or authorized repair vendors at designated mileage intervals or every 90 days whichever occurs first trailers are also scheduled for preventive maintenance every 90 days

customers

revenue is generated primarily from customers throughout the united states and north america in 2021 our largest customer accounted for approximately 54 of our revenue and our largest 5 10 and 20 customers accounted for 160 223 and 302 of our revenue respectively for each of our last two fiscal years more than 95 of our revenue was derived from services performed in the united states and less than 5 of our revenue was generated from services performed internationally we believe the diversity of our customer base helps protect our business from adverse developments in a single geographic region and from the reduction or loss of business from a single customer

we utilize an integrated freightcosting system to determine the price level at which a particular freight shipment will be profitable we can modify elements of this freightcosting model to simulate the actual conditions under which the freight will be moved many of our customers engage our services through the terms and provisions of our tariffs and through negotiated service contracts we also compete for business by participating in bid solicitations customers generally solicit bids for relatively large numbers of shipments for a period of one to two years and typically choose to enter into contractual arrangements with a limited number of motor carriers based upon price and service 

 

 

seasonality

our tonnage levels and revenue mix are subject to seasonal trends common in our industry although other factors such as macroeconomic changes could cause variation in these trends our revenue and operating margins in the first and fourth quarters are typically lower than those during the second and third quarters due to reduced shipments during the winter months however the effects of the covid19 pandemic on the domestic economy impacted our normal seasonal trends during 2020 and may continue to impact our seasonal trends in future periods harsh winter weather hurricanes tornadoes floods and other natural disasters can also adversely impact our performance by reducing demand and increasing operating expenses we believe seasonal trends will continue to impact our business 

technology

our technology is critical to the success and delivery of the premium service provided by our operations we continually seek to upgrade and enhance our technological capabilities we also provide access to our systems through multiple secure gateways that offer our customers and employees maximum flexibility and access to information we employ vehicle safety systems forwardfacing cameras onboard computer systems smart phones freight handling systems and logistics technology to reduce costs and transit times as well as to meet regulatory requirements our data systems are integrated at every level within our organization which we believe is critical to our success our systems are protected through physical and software safeguards as well as redundant systems network security measures and backup systems we continue to focus on the development and enhancement of the technology used in our operations in order to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of our services

insurance

we carry a significant amount of insurance with thirdparty insurance carriers that provides various levels of protection for our risk exposure including protection in the areas of property casualty cyber management and group health with coverage limits and retentiondeductible levels that we believe are reasonable given historical claim activity and severity we believe that our policy of maintaining selfinsured retentions or deductibles under these various insurance programs for a portion of our risks supported by our safety claims management and loss prevention programs is an effective means of managing insurance costs we periodically review our risk exposure and insurance coverage applicable to those risks and believe that we maintain sufficient insurance coverage

diesel fuel availability and cost

we depend heavily upon the availability and quality of diesel fuel including alternative fuel types to provide our transportation services we maintain fuel storage and pumping facilities at certain service center locations as the primary source for fueling our fleet and we utilize overtheroad fueling options at retail locations as necessary we could be susceptible to regional andor national fuel shortages which could cause us to incur additional expense in order to obtain an adequate supply within our own fueling network or cause us to rely more heavily on higherpriced retail fuel

we believe our operations and financial condition are susceptible to the same diesel fuel price increases or shortages as those of our competitors our fuel surcharge programs are one of many components that we use to determine the overall price for our transportation services our fuel surcharges are generally indexed to fuel prices published by the us department of energy the “doe” that reset each week

human capital

employee profile

as of december 31 2021 we employed 23663 active fulltime employees none of which were represented under a collective bargaining agreement our fulltime employees work in the following roles



 

 

 

 

 

employee engagement and benefits

our old dominion family of employees are a key factor in the success of our business the unique od family culture encourages development and employee engagement and motivates our employees to provide the superior customer service for which we are known we believe this culture is part of what attracts employees and helps keep our turnover rates low we also provide our employees with a comprehensive benefits package including a plan that covers our eligible employees’ premium for health insurance voluntary disability and life insurance coverages a flexible paid time off policy a 401k plan with a guaranteed employer match as well as a discretionary employer match opportunity and various wellness programs designed to assist employees with establishing and living a healthy and balanced lifestyle

employee development and safety

as of december 31 2021 we employed 6158 linehaul drivers and 5644 pd drivers on a fulltime basis we select our drivers based upon many factors including driving records and experience among other requirements our drivers must pass a drug test have a current us department of transportation “dot” physical and have a valid commercial driver’s license prior to employment once employed drivers are required to obtain and maintain hazardous materials endorsements to their commercial driver’s licenses drivers like all of our employees are required to take preemployment drug and alcohol tests and are randomly selected for periodic additional testing

since 1988 we have provided a nocost opportunity for qualified employees to become drivers through the “old dominion driver training program” there are currently 3389 active drivers who have successfully completed this training which was approximately 287 of our driver workforce as of december 31 2021 we believe our driver training and qualification programs have been important factors in improving our safety record and retaining qualified drivers in fact over 18 of our drivers have achieved one million safe driving miles or more in addition we have experienced an annual turnover rate for our driver graduates of approximately 64 which is below our companywide turnover rate for all drivers of approximately 90

we also maintain a “management trainee program” and a “supervisor development program” that offers opportunities for our employees to be considered and prepared for sales and management opportunities these programs support our philosophy of promoting from within our highquality workforce

based on driving records our drivers are eligible to be rewarded with annual safety bonuses of up to 3000 per driver our safety bonuses paid to drivers totaled 49 million 47 million and 46 million in 2021 2020 and 2019 respectively

throughout the covid19 pandemic we have remained focused on protecting the health and safety of our employees while meeting the needs of our customers we implemented various measures to help ensure the safety and wellbeing of our od family of employees following guidelines issued by the us centers for disease control and prevention and the world health organization across our businesses we continue to take measures to prevent workplace hazards encourage safe behaviors and promote a culture of continuous improvement to ensure our processes help reduce incidents and illnesses and comply with governing health and safety laws 

governmental regulation

we are regulated by the dot and by various state and federal agencies these regulatory authorities have broad powers over matters relating to authorized motor carrier operations as well as motor carrier registration driver hours of service safety and fitness of transportation equipment and drivers transportation of hazardous materials certain mergers and acquisitions and periodic financial reporting the trucking industry is also subject to regulatory and legislative changes from a variety of other governmental authorities which address matters such as increasingly stringent environmental regulations occupational safety and health regulations limits on vehicle weight and size ergonomics port security and driver hours of service

in addition we are subject to compliance with cargosecurity and transportation regulations issued by the transportation security administration “tsa” and customs and border protection “cbp” within the us department of homeland security regulatory requirements and changes in regulatory requirements or guidance may affect our business or the economics of the industry by requiring changes in operating practices that could influence the demand for and increase the costs of providing transportation services

driver hours of service

the federal motor carrier safety administration the “fmcsa” rules provide that a truck driver may work no more than a maximum number of 60 hours within seven consecutive days and 70 hours within eight consecutive days fmcsa rules further impose a maximum work period of 14 hours no more than 11 hours of which may be driving time after first coming onduty 

 

 

following 10 consecutive hours of offduty time fmcsa rules also require that drivers take a 30minute break prior to driving beyond eight hours our drivers utilize electronic logging devices “elds” for the purpose of recording their hours of service 

commercial driver’s license drug and alcohol clearinghouse

we are registered as a motor carrier with the commercial driver’s license drug and alcohol clearinghouse which requires us to check for drug and alcohol violations of current drivers at least annually and prospective employees prior to hiring we have completed our annual limited query and prehire driver authorization queries

environmental regulation

we are subject to various federal state and local environmental laws and regulations that focus on among other things the disposal emission and discharge of hazardous waste hazardous materials or other materials into the environment or their presence at our properties or in our vehicles fuel storage tanks transportation of certain materials and the discharge or retention of storm water under specific environmental laws we could also be held responsible for any costs relating to contamination at our past or present facilities and at thirdparty waste disposal sites as well as costs associated with cleanup of accidents involving our vehicles we do not believe that the cost of future compliance with current environmental laws or regulations will have a material adverse effect on our operations financial condition competitive position or capital expenditures for the remainder of 2022 or fiscal year 2023 however future changes to laws or regulations may adversely affect our operations and could result in unforeseen costs to our business

 item 1a risk factors

an investment in our common stock involves a variety of risks and uncertainties the following describes some of the material risks that could adversely affect our business financial condition operating results or cash flows we may also be adversely impacted by other risks not presently known to us or that we currently consider immaterial

risks related to our business and operations 

if we are unable to successfully execute our growth strategy and develop market and consistently deliver highquality services that meet customer expectations our business and future results of operations may suffer

our growth strategy includes increasing the volume of freight moving through our existing service center network and selectively expanding our capacity in the united states through market share gains in connection with our growth strategy at various times we have consistently expanded and upgraded service centers purchased additional equipment and increased our sales and marketing efforts and we expect to continue to do so our growth strategy exposes us to a number of risks including the following













 

 





we cannot ensure that we will overcome the risks associated with our growth strategy if we fail to overcome those risks we may not realize projected growth and related revenue or profits from our efforts we may incur additional expenses and as a result our financial position and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected

we face various risks related to health epidemics pandemics and similar outbreaks that have had and may continue to have adverse effects on our business results of operations and financial condition

the novel coronavirus covid19 pandemic the governmentalsocial responses thereto and the related changes in the economic and political conditions in markets in which we operate have had adverse impacts on our business results of operations and financial condition and on those of our customers and suppliers and these adverse impacts may continue these impacts and potential impacts include among other things significant reductions or volatility in demand for our services inability of our customers to timely pay for our services and failure of our suppliers or thirdparty service providers to meet their obligations to us we may also experience capacity constraints in one or more geographic areas if a significant number of our employees in any such region are affected by covid19 furthermore covid19 has impacted and may further impact the global economy including negatively impacting the proper functioning of financial and capital markets and interest rates which at times has impacted the cost of capital and limited access to capital as the covid19 pandemic continues to adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition it has heightened and will likely continue to heighten other risks to which we are subject including those related to economic downturns customersuppliervendor operations labor issues inflationary pressures supply chain disruptions changes in political and regulatory conditions liquidity and industry pricing environment stability as described in further detail in other risk factors despite our efforts to manage our exposure to these risks the ultimate impact of covid19 and similar outbreaks depends on factors beyond our knowledge or control including the duration and severity of any outbreak and governmentalsocial actions taken to contain its spread and mitigate its public health impact

changes in our relationships with significant customers including the loss or reduction in business from one or more of them could have an adverse impact on our business

we do not believe the loss of any one customer would materially impact our business and revenue growth due to the diversity of our customer base we do however have a number of customers whose demand for our services is tied to us industrial production or the broader domestic economy that could collectively drive business and revenue growth these customers could experience a decrease in production due to a decrease in the demand for their products as a result of a decline in the us economy or other global economic factors such as the slowdown in the domestic economy associated with the covid19 pandemic they could also use other ltl providers and other modes of transportation such as truckload and intermodal in response to capacity service and pricing issues finally unfavorable publicity about us or our employees particularly given the current environment of instantaneous communication and social media outlets could damage our reputation and result in these customers reducing their demand for our services if these factors resulted in a reduction or loss of business from these customers there could be a material impact on our business and revenue growth

insurance and claims expenses could significantly reduce our profitability

we are exposed to a variety of claims including but not limited to those related to cargo loss and damage property damage personal injury workers’ compensation and healthcare we have insurance coverage with thirdparty insurance carriers but we assume a significant portion of the risk associated with these claims due to our selfinsured retentions and deductibles our operating results could be adversely affected if any of the following were to occur i the number or the severity of claims increases ii we are required to accrue or pay additional amounts because claims prove to be more severe than our original assessment or iii claims exceed our coverage amounts if claims exceed our selfinsured retention or deductible levels insurance companies exit the transportation insurance marketplace or insurance market conditions change insurers could raise premiums for excess coverage to cover their expenses and anticipated future losses coverage also may not be procured or be unavailable for certain claims in addition insurance companies generally require us to collateralize our selfinsured retention or deductible levels if these collateralization requirements increase our borrowing capacity could be adversely affected

reductions in the available supply or increases in the cost of new equipment may adversely impact our profitability and cash flows 

we may face difficulty in purchasing new equipment due to decreased supply or increased costs investment in new equipment is a significant part of our annual capital expenditures and we require an available supply of tractors trailers and other freight handling equipment from manufacturers to operate and grow our business we may also be subject to shortages in raw materials that 

 

 

are required for the production of critical operating equipment and supplies such as shortages in rubber or steel currently tractor and trailer manufacturers are experiencing significant shortages of various component parts and supplies forcing many manufacturers to reduce or suspend their production which has led to a lower supply of tractors  trailers and other equipment  higher prices and lengthened trade cycles  

in addition the availability and price of our equipment may also be adversely affected in the future by regulations on newly manufactured equipment and engines we are subject to regulations issued by the us environmental protection agency the “epa” and various state agencies particularly the california air resources board “carb” that have required progressive reductions in exhaust emissions we may become subject to new or more restrictive regulations or differing interpretations of existing regulations which may increase the cost of providing transportation services or adversely affect our results of operations we are also unable to predict how any future changes in us government policy will affect epa and carb regulation and enforcement 

these regulations the limited equipment availability and other supply chain factors have resulted and could continue to result in higher prices for new equipment which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations particularly our maintenance expense mileage productivity and driver retention

our growth may be limited by the availability and cost of thirdparty transportation used to supplement our workforce and equipment needs

our growth strategy depends upon our ability to maintain adequate capacity throughout our service center network to support the transportation service needs of our customers in order to maintain adequate capacity to support our customers’ demand for our services we may from time to time utilize thirdparty transportation services to supplement our workforce and equipment needs if we are unable to find suitable thirdparty transportation service providers that meet our high servicedelivery standards at a reasonable cost when needed our revenue growth and financial results may be adversely impacted 

we may be adversely impacted by fluctuations in the availability and price of diesel fuel

diesel fuel is a critical component of our operations and a significant operating expense for our business future fluctuations in prices and diesel fuel availability could have a material adverse effect on our operating results diesel fuel prices and fuel availability can be impacted by factors beyond our control such as natural or manmade disasters adverse weather conditions political events disruption or failure of technology or information systems price and supply decisions by oil producing countries and cartels terrorist activities armed conflict world supply and demand imbalances tariffs sanctions and quotas or other changes to trade agreements we maintain fuel storage and pumping facilities at many of our service center locations however we may be susceptible to fuel shortages at certain locations that could cause us to incur additional expense to ensure adequate supply on a timely basis and to prevent a disruption to our service schedules an interruption in the supply of diesel fuel could have a material adverse effect on our operating results

we do not hedge against the risk of diesel fuel price increases an increase in diesel fuel prices or diesel fuel taxes or any change in federal or state regulations that results in such an increase could have a material adverse effect on our operating results we have fuel surcharge programs in place with a majority of our customers which help offset the negative impact of the increased cost of diesel fuel and other petroleumbased products however we also incur fuel costs that cannot be recovered even with respect to customers with which we maintain fuel surcharge programs such as those costs associated with empty miles because our fuel surcharge recovery lags behind changes in fuel prices our fuel surcharge recovery may not capture the increased costs we pay for fuel especially when prices are rising leading to fluctuations in our levels of reimbursement we regularly monitor the components of our pricing including fuel surcharges and address individual account profitability issues with our customers when necessary however there can be no assurance that fuel surcharges can be maintained indefinitely or will be sufficiently effective in offsetting increases in diesel fuel prices

our results of operations may be affected by seasonal factors harsh weather conditions and disasters

our operations are subject to seasonal trends common in our industry our revenue and operating margins in the first and fourth quarters are typically lower than those during the second and third quarters due to reduced shipments decreased fuel efficiency increased coldweather related maintenance costs of revenue equipment and increased insurance and claims costs during the winter months however the effects of the covid19 pandemic on the domestic economy has impacted and may continue to impact our normal seasonal trends harsh winter weather or natural disasters including but not limited to hurricanes tornadoes floods fires earthquakes and storms can also adversely impact our performance by disrupting freight shipments or routes destroying our assets disrupting fuel supplies increasing fuel costs increasing maintenance costs reducing demand and negatively impacting the business or financial condition of our customers any of which could harm our results of operations or make our results of operations more volatile

 

 

we have significant ongoing cash requirements that could limit our growth and affect our profitability if we are unable to obtain sufficient capital 

our business is highly capital intensive as further described in part ii item 7 of this annual report on form 10k we generally finance our capital expenditures and planned growth with existing cash cash flows from operations issuance of debt including pursuant to our note purchase and private shelf agreement and through available borrowings under our existing senior unsecured credit agreement we may require additional capital to finance longterm real estate purchase opportunities and acquisitions which we may fund through additional debt or through equity offerings if we are unable to generate sufficient cash from our operations or raise capital by accessing the debt and equity markets we may be forced to limit our growth and operate our equipment for longer periods of time which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results

our business also has significant ongoing operating cash requirements if our cash requirements are high or our cash flows from operations is low during particular periods we may need to seek additional financing which could be costly or difficult to obtain

a decrease in the demand and value of used equipment may impact our results of operations

as we purchase new tractors and trailers as part of our normal replacement cycle each year we rely on the used equipment market to dispose of our older equipment oversupply in the transportation industry as well as adverse domestic and foreign economic conditions can negatively impact the demand for used equipment and therefore reduce the value we can obtain on our used equipment if we are unable to sell our older equipment at or above our salvage value the resulting losses could have a significant impact on our results of operations

we may be unable to successfully consummate and integrate acquisitions

in the future we may seek to acquire other ltl carriers as well as other complementary businesses exploration of potential acquisitions requires significant attention from our management team in addition we expect to compete for acquisition opportunities with other companies some of which may have greater financial and other resources than we do we cannot ensure that we will have sufficient cash to consummate an acquisition or otherwise be able to obtain financing for an acquisition if we are unable to access sufficient funding for potential acquisitions we may not be able to complete transactions that we otherwise find advantageous

any subsequent acquisition will entail numerous risks including



















in addition we may have difficulty integrating any acquired business and its operations services and personnel into our existing operations and such integration may require a significant amount of time and effort by our management team to the extent we do not successfully avoid or overcome the risks or problems resulting from any acquisitions we undertake there could be a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations

 

 

we are subject to various risks arising from our international business operations and relationships which could adversely affect our business 

we arrange for transportation and logistics services to and from various international locations and are subject to both the risks of conducting international business and the requirements of the foreign corrupt practices act of 1977 the “fcpa” failure to comply with the fcpa may result in legal claims against us in addition we face other risks associated with international operations and relationships which may include restrictive trade policies the renegotiation of international trade agreements imposition of duties taxes or government royalties imposed by foreign governments which could adversely affect our business

antiterrorism measures and terrorist events may disrupt our business

federal state and municipal authorities have implemented and are continuing to implement various antiterrorism measures including checkpoints and travel restrictions on large trucks if additional security measures disrupt or impede the timing of our deliveries we may fail to meet the requirements of our customers or incur increased expenses to do so there can be no assurance that new antiterrorism measures will not be implemented and that such measures will not have a material adverse effect on our operations

risks related to our industry 

we operate in a rapidly evolving and highly competitive industry and our business will suffer if we are unable to adequately address potential downward pricing pressures and other factors that may adversely affect our operations and profitability

our industry faced with requirements for faster deliveries and increased visibility into shipments is rapidly evolving and increasingly competitive numerous competitive factors could impair our ability to maintain our current profitability these factors include but are not limited to the following





























 

 

if we are unable to effectively compete with other ltl carriers whether on the basis of price service  brand recognition or otherwise we may be unable to retain existing customers or attract new customers either of which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations furthermore continued merger and acquisition activity in transportation and logistics could result in stronger or new competitors which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations we may not be able to compete successfully in an increasingly consolidated ltl industry and cannot predict with certainty how industry consolidation will affect our competitors or us 

our customers’ and suppliers’ businesses may be impacted by various economic factors such as recessions downturns in the economy global uncertainty and instability changes in us social political and regulatory conditions andor a disruption of financial markets which may decrease demand for our services or increase our costs

adverse economic conditions both in the us and internationally can negatively affect our customers’ business levels the amount of transportation services they need their ability to pay for our services and overall freight levels any of which might impair our asset utilization additionally uncertainty and instability in the global economy and any other action that the us government may take to withdraw from or materially modify international trade arrangements including related to the united statesmexicocanada agreement may lead to fewer goods being transported and could have a material adverse effect on our business financial conditions and results of operations the us government has made significant changes in us trade policy and has taken certain other actions that may impact us trade including imposing tariffs on certain goods imported into the united states to date several governments including the european union china and india have imposed tariffs on certain goods imported from the united states any further changes in us or international trade policy could trigger additional retaliatory actions by affected countries resulting in “trade wars” and increased costs for goods transported globally which may reduce customer demand for these products if the parties having to pay those tariffs increase their prices or in trading partners limiting their trade with countries that impose antitrade measures if these consequences are realized the volume of global economic activity may be significantly reduced such a reduction could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition

customers adversely impacted by changes in us trade policies or otherwise encountering adverse economic conditions including as a result of the covid19 pandemic may be unable to obtain additional financing or financing under acceptable terms these customers represent a greater potential for bad debt losses which may require us to increase our reserve for bad debt economic conditions resulting in bankruptcies of a concentration of our customers could have a significant impact on our financial position results of operations or liquidity in a particular year or quarter further when adverse economic times arise customers may select competitors that offer lower rates in an attempt to lower their costs and we might be forced to lower our rates or lose freight volumes

our suppliers’ business levels also may be negatively affected by adverse economic conditions and changes in the political and regulatory environment both in the us and internationally or financial constraints including as a result of the covid19 pandemic which could lead to disruptions in the supply and availability of equipment parts and services critical to our operations a significant interruption in our normal supply chain could disrupt our operations increase our costs and negatively impact our ability to serve our customers

we are also subject to cost increases outside of our control that could materially reduce our profitability if we are unable to increase our rates sufficiently such cost increases include but are not limited to increases in wage rates fuel prices interest rates taxes tolls license and registration fees insurance revenue equipment and healthcare for our employees

risks related to labor matters

if our employees were to unionize our operating costs would increase and our ability to compete would be impaired

none of our employees are currently represented under a collective bargaining agreement however from time to time there have been efforts to organize our employees at various service centers further congress or one or more states could approve legislation andor the national labor relations board could render decisions or implement rule changes that could significantly affect our business and our relationship with our employees including actions that could substantially liberalize the procedures for union organization in addition we can offer no assurance that the department of labor will not adopt new regulations or interpret existing regulations in a manner that would favor the agenda of unions or that our employees will not unionize in the future particularly if regulatory changes occur that facilitate unionization

 

 

 

the unionization of our employees could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations because











increases in employee compensation and benefit packages used to attract and retain qualified employees including drivers and maintenance technicians and addressing general labor market challenges could adversely affect our profitability our ability to maintain or grow our fleet and our ability to maintain our customer relationships

recently there has been intense competition for qualified employees specifically drivers in the transportation industry resulting from a shortage of drivers and general labor market challenges the extent and duration of the impact of these challenges are subject to numerous factors including the continuing impact of the covid19 pandemic our stringent hiring standards behavioral changes prevailing wage rates and other benefits health and other insurance costs inflation adoption of new or revised employment and labor laws and regulations or government programs and changing workforce demographics as the available pool of qualified drivers has been declining we have faced and may continue to face difficulty maintaining or increasing our number of drivers similarly in recent years there has been a decrease in the overall supply of skilled maintenance technicians particularly new technicians with qualifications from technical programs and schools which has made it more difficult and may continue to make it more difficult to attract and retain skilled technicians the compensation and benefit packages we offer our drivers technicians and other specialized employees is subject to market conditions that have required and may in the future require further increases in wages and benefits if we are unable to attract and retain a sufficient number of qualified drivers and technicians or address general labor market challenges we could be required to adjust our compensation and benefits packages amend our hiring standards or operate with fewer trucks and face difficulty meeting customer demands any of which could adversely affect our growth and profitability

if we are unable to retain our key employees or if we do not continue to effectively execute our succession plan our financial condition results of operations and liquidity could be adversely affected

our success will continue to depend upon the experience and leadership of our key employees and executive officers in that regard the loss of the services of any of our key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and liquidity if we are unable to secure replacement personnel who have sufficient experience in our industry and in the management of our business if we are unable to continue to develop and retain a core group of management personnel and execute succession planning strategies or we encounter any unforeseen difficulties associated with the transition of members of our management team our business could be negatively impacted in the future

risks related to cybersecurity and technology matters

our information technology systems are subject to cyber and other risks some of which are beyond our control which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial position

we rely heavily on the proper functioning and availability of our information systems for our operations as well as for providing valueadded services to our customers our information systems including our accounting communications and data processing systems are integral to the efficient operation of our business it is critical that the data processed by these systems remains confidential as it often includes competitive customer information confidential customer payment and transaction information employee records and key financial and operational results and statistics the sophistication of efforts by hackers foreign governments cyberterrorists and cybercriminals acting individually or in coordinated groups to launch distributed denial of service attacks or other coordinated attacks that may cause service outages gain inappropriate or block legitimate access to systems or information or result in other business interruptions has continued to increase in recent years we utilize thirdparty service providers who have access to our systems and certain sensitive data which exposes us to additional security risks particularly given the complex and evolving laws and regulations regarding privacy and data protection while we and our thirdparty service providers have experienced cyberattacks and attempted breaches of our and their information technology systems and networks or similar events from time to time no such incidents have been individually or in the aggregate material to us cyber incidents that impact the security availability reliability speed accuracy or other proper functioning of our systems information and measures including outages computer viruses breakins and similar disruptions could have a significant impact on our operations

 

 

we have security processes protocols and standards in place to protect our information systems including through physical and software safeguards as well as redundant systems network security measures and backup systems nevertheless it is difficult to fully protect against the possibility of power loss telecommunications failures cyberattacks and other cyber incidents in every potential circumstance that may arise a significant cyber incident including system failure security breach disruption by malware or ransomware or other damage could interrupt or delay our operations damage our reputation and brand cause a loss of customers expose us to a risk of loss or litigation result in regulatory scrutiny investigations actions fines or penalties andor cause us to incur significant time and expense to remedy such an event any of which could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial position furthermore any failure to comply with data privacy security or other laws and regulations such as the california consumer privacy act and similar laws in the united states at both the federal and state level could result in claims legal or regulatory proceedings inquiries or investigations as cyber threats are continually evolving our controls and procedures may become inadequate and we may be required to devote additional resources to modifying or enhancing our systems in the future furthermore while we maintain insurance intended to address costs associated with aspects of cyber incidents network failures and data privacyrelated concerns our coverage may not sufficiently cover all types of losses or claims that may arise 

if we do not adapt to new technologies implemented by our competitors in the ltl and transportation industry our business could suffer

the ltl and transportation industry may be impacted by rapid changes in technologies our competitors may implement new technology that could improve their service price available capacity or business relationships and increase their market share if we do not appropriately adapt our operations to these new technologies our business financial condition and results of operations may suffer

failure to keep pace with developments in technology any disruption to our technology infrastructure or failures of essential services upon which our technology platforms rely could cause us to incur costs or result in a loss of business which may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition

we rely heavily on information technology systems our information technology systems are complex and require ongoing investments and enhancements to meet both internal requirements and the requirements of our customers if we are unable to invest in and enhance or modernize our technology systems in a timely manner or at a reasonable cost or if we are unable to train our employees to operate the new enhanced or modernized systems our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected we also may not achieve the benefits that we anticipate from any new technology or new or modernized system and a failure to do so could result in higher than anticipated costs or adversely affect our results of operations

our information technology systems also depend upon the internet thirdparty service providers global communications providers satellitebased communications systems the electric utilities grid electric utility providers and telecommunications providers we have minimal control over the operation quality or maintenance of these services or whether vendors will improve their services or continue to provide services that are essential to our business disruptions due to transitional challenges in upgrading or enhancing our technology systems failures in the services upon which our information technology platforms rely including those that may arise from adverse weather conditions or natural calamities including but not limited to floods hurricanes earthquakes or tornadoes illegal acts including terrorist attacks human error or systems modernization initiatives andor other disruptions may adversely affect our business which could increase our costs or result in a loss of customers that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition

risks related to legal and regulatory matters

the fmcsa’s csa initiative could adversely impact our ability to hire qualified drivers meet our growth projections and maintain our customer relationships each of which could adversely impact our results of operations

the fmcsa’s compliance safety accountability initiative “csa” is an enforcement and compliance program designed to monitor and improve commercial motor vehicle safety by measuring the safety record of both the motor carrier and the driver these measurements are scored and used by the fmcsa to identify potential safety risks and to direct enforcement action

our csa scores are dependent upon our safety and compliance experience which could change at any time in addition the safety standards prescribed in csa could change and our ability to maintain an acceptable score could be adversely impacted public disclosure of certain csa scores was restricted through the enactment of the fixing america’s surface transportation act of 2015 the “fast act” on december 4 2015 however the fast act does not restrict public disclosure of all data collected by the fmcsa the fmcsa is currently reviewing csa methodology to address deficiencies identified by the national academy of sciences including the possibility of weak or negative correlation between current safety improvement categories and vehicle crash risk nevertheless if we receive unacceptable csa scores and this data is made available to the public our relationships with our customers could be damaged which could result in a loss of business

 

 

the requirements of the csa could also shrink the industry’s pool of drivers as those with unfavorable scores could leave the industry as a result the costs to attract train and retain qualified drivers could increase in addition a shortage of qualified drivers could increase driver turnover decrease asset utilization limit growth and adversely impact our results of operations 

we operate in a highly regulated industry and increased costs of compliance with or liability for violation of existing or future regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business

we are regulated by the dot and by various state and federal agencies these regulatory authorities have broad powers over matters relating to authorized motor carrier operations as well as motor carrier registration driver hours of service safety and fitness of transportation equipment and drivers transportation of hazardous materials certain mergers and acquisitions and periodic financial reporting the trucking industry is also subject to regulatory and legislative changes from a variety of other governmental authorities which address matters such as increasingly stringent environmental regulations occupational safety and health regulations limits on vehicle weight and size ergonomics port security and driver hours of service we are also subject to the costs and potential adverse impact of compliance associated with fmcsa’s eld regulations and guidance including the operation of our fleet and safety management systems on the eld hardware and software platform in addition we are subject to compliance with cargosecurity and transportation regulations issued by the tsa and cbp within the us department of homeland security regulatory requirements and changes in regulatory requirements or guidance together with the growing compliance risks presented by increased differences between applicable federal and state regulations may affect our business or the economics of the industry by requiring changes in operating practices that could influence the demand for and increase the costs of providing transportation services

we are subject to various governmental laws and regulations and costs of compliance with liabilities under or violations of existing or future governmental laws or regulations could adversely affect our business

we are subject to various federal state and local environmental laws and regulations that govern among other things the disposal emission and discharge of hazardous waste hazardous materials or other materials into the environment their presence at our properties or in our vehicles fuel storage tanks the transportation of certain materials and the discharge or retention of storm water under specific environmental laws we could also be held responsible for any costs relating to contamination at our past or present facilities and at thirdparty waste disposal sites as well as costs associated with the cleanup of accidents involving our vehicles environmental laws have become and may continue to be increasingly more stringent over time and there can be no assurance that our costs of complying with current or future environmental laws or liabilities arising under such laws will not have a material adverse effect on our business operations or financial condition

we may be adversely affected by legal regulatory or market responses to climate change concerns

increased concern over climate change and the potential impact of global warming has led to an increase in the consideration of greenhouse gas emissions regulation due to increased consideration there could be an increase in regulation from federal state and local governments related to our carbon footprint including with respect to vehicle engine and facility emissions this increase in regulation could result in increased direct costs such as taxes fees fuel or capital costs or changes to our operations in order to comply there is also a focus from regulators and our customers on sustainability issues this focus may result in new legislation or customer requirements such as limits on vehicle weight and size or energy source finally given the increasing focus on esg matters by the investor community if shareholders were to express dissatisfaction with our policies or efforts with respect to climate change sustainability or similar matters there could be a negative impact on our stock price and we could also suffer reputational harm costs and operational risks associated with future climate change concerns or environmental laws and regulations sustainability requirements and related investor expectations could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations liquidity and cash flows

healthcare legislation and other mandated benefitsrelated coverage may increase our costs for employee healthcare and benefits and reduce our future profitability

to attract and retain employees we maintain a competitive and comprehensive benefits plan for our employees and their dependents we cannot predict the impact that any state or federal healthcare or mandated benefit legislation or regulation will have on our operations but we expect costs associated with providing benefits under employee medical plans paid sick and family leave programs and healthcarerelated costs associated with workers’ compensation to continue to increase rising employee benefits and healthcare costs in the us could result in significant longterm costs to us which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results in addition rising employee benefits and healthrelated costs could force us to make further changes to our benefits program which could negatively impact our ability to attract and retain employees

 

 

we are subject to the risks of litigation and governmental proceedings inquiries notices or investigations which could adversely affect our business 

the nature of our business exposes us to the potential for various claims and litigation related to labor and employment personal injury property damage cargo claims safety and contract compliance environmental liability and other matters accordingly we are and in the future may be subject to legal proceedings and claims that have arisen in the ordinary course of our business and may include collective andor class action allegations we are also subject to potential governmental proceedings inquiries notices or investigations which also exposes us to the potential for various claims and litigation the parties in such actions may seek amounts from us that may not be covered in whole or in part by insurance defending ourselves against such actions could result in significant costs and could require a substantial amount of time and effort by our management team we cannot predict the outcome of litigation or governmental proceedings inquiries notices or investigations to which we are a party or whether we will be subject to future legal actions as a result the potential costs associated with any such legal actions against us could adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations

we are subject to legislative regulatory and legal developments involving taxes

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations

this management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations generally discusses our 2021 and 2020 results and yeartoyear comparisons between 2021 and 2020 discussions of our 2019 results and yeartoyear comparisons between 2020 and 2019 that are not included in this annual report on form 10k can be found in “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” in part ii item 7 of our annual report on form 10k for the fiscal year ended december 31 2020 which was filed with the securities and exchange commission on february 24 2021

overview

we are one of the largest north american lessthantruckload “ltl” motor carriers we provide regional interregional and national ltl services through a single integrated unionfree organization our service offerings which include expedited transportation are provided through an expansive network of service centers located throughout the continental united states through strategic alliances we also provide ltl services throughout north america in addition to our core ltl services we offer a range of valueadded services including container drayage truckload brokerage and supply chain consulting more than 98 of our revenue has historically been derived from transporting ltl shipments for our customers whose demand for our services is generally tied to industrial production and the overall health of the us domestic economy

in analyzing the components of our revenue we monitor changes and trends in our ltl volumes and ltl revenue per hundredweight while ltl revenue per hundredweight is a yield measurement it is also a commonlyused indicator for general pricing trends in the ltl industry this yield metric is not a true measure of price however as it can be influenced by many other factors such as changes in fuel surcharges weight per shipment and length of haul as a result changes in revenue per hundredweight do not necessarily indicate actual changes in underlying base rates ltl revenue per hundredweight and the key factors that can impact this metric are described in more detail below









our primary revenue focus is to increase density which is shipment and tonnage growth within our existing infrastructure increases in density allow us to maximize our asset utilization and labor productivity which we measure over many different functional areas of our operations including linehaul load factor pickup and delivery “pd” stops per hour pd shipments per hour platform pounds handled per hour and platform shipments per hour in addition to our focus on density and operating efficiencies it is critical for us to obtain an appropriate yield which is measured as revenue per hundredweight on the shipments we handle to offset our cost inflation and support our ongoing investments in capacity and technology we regularly monitor the components of our pricing including base freight rates accessorial charges and fuel surcharges the fuel surcharge is generally designed to offset fluctuations in the cost of our petroleumbased products and is indexed to diesel fuel prices published by the us 

 

 

department of energy  which reset each week we believe our yield management process focused on individual account profitability and ongoing improvements in operating efficiencies are both key components of our ability to produce profitable growth 

our primary cost elements are direct wages and benefits associated with the movement of freight operating supplies and expenses which include diesel fuel and depreciation of our equipment fleet and service center facilities we gauge our overall success in managing costs by monitoring our operating ratio a measure of profitability calculated by dividing total operating expenses by revenue which also allows for industrywide comparisons with our competition

we regularly upgrade our technological capabilities to improve our customer service and lower our operating costs our technology provides our customers with visibility of their shipments throughout our network increases the productivity of our workforce and provides key metrics that we use to monitor and enhance our processes

results of operations

the following table sets forth for the years indicated expenses and other items as a percentage of revenue from operations



key financial and operating metrics for 2021 and 2020 are presented below



our financial results for 2021 reflect the highest annual revenue and profitability in our company’s history we believe the increase in our annual revenue to 53 billion in 2021 was driven by the consistent execution of our longterm strategy of providing superior service to customers at a fair price while continuing to invest in capacity and technology to support the increased customer demand for our services our revenue growth reflects higher shipment volumes and further improvements in our yield both of which were supported by the strength of the domestic economy the increased freight density in our service center network and improvement in our yield combined with improved operating efficiencies led to the 390 basispoint improvement in our operating ratio to 735 

 

 

for 2021 as compared to 2020 as a result net income and earnings per diluted share increased by 538 and 565 respectively in 2021 as compared to 2020 

revenue

revenue increased 124 billion or 309 in 2021 compared to 2020 due to increases in both our ltl tonnage and ltl revenue per hundredweight the increase in tonnage resulted from higher ltl shipment volumes that were partially offset by a decrease in ltl weight per shipment our ltl weight per shipment declined due primarily to our continuing efforts to reduce the number of heavyweighted and larger hardertohandle types of shipments in our network we believe the increase in ltl shipments was driven by higher customer demand for our superior service coupled with our available network capacity and the strength of the us domestic economy 

our ltl revenue per hundredweight increased 131 in 2021 compared to 2020 we believe the increase in ltl revenue per hundredweight was driven by the success of our longterm pricing strategy as well as changes in mix of our freight the increase also reflects the positive impact of a decline in weight per shipment and an increase in average length of haul on this metric excluding fuel surcharges ltl revenue per hundredweight increased 88 in 2021 compared to 2020

january 2022 update

revenue per day increased 257 in january 2022 compared to the same month last year ltl tons per day increased 77 due primarily to a 102 increase in ltl shipments per day that was offset by a 22 decrease in ltl weight per shipment ltl revenue per hundredweight increased 168 as compared to the same month last year ltl revenue per hundredweight excluding fuel surcharges increased 110 as compared to the same month last year 

operating costs and other expenses

salaries wages and benefits increased 4141 million or 202 in 2021 as compared to 2020 due to a 2720 million increase in the costs attributable to salaries and wages and a 1421 million increase in employee benefit costs the increase in salaries and wages was due primarily to increases in the average number of active fulltime employees and increases in our employees’ wage rates our average number of active fulltime employees increased 3034 or 159 during 2021 as compared to 2020 we believe our fulltime employee headcount will continue to increase as we hire employees to balance our workforce with ongoing growth in customer demand and shipment trends our employees’ salaries and wages also increased as a result of the annual wage increases provided to our employees in september 2021 as well as higher performancebased compensation

our productive labor costs which include wages for drivers platform employees and fleet technicians improved as a percent of revenue to 251 in 2021 compared to 278 in 2020 this improvement includes the impact of increases in our linehaul laden load average and pd shipments per hour as we increased density across our network as well as declines in our platform shipments per hour as we trained our new employees our other salaries and wages as a percent of revenue also decreased to 93 in 2021 as compared to 104 in 2020 

the increase in the costs attributable to employee benefits of 1421 million or 274 includes the impact of the increase in the number of fulltime employees eligible for our benefits our employee benefit costs also increased due to additional holiday pay benefits provided in 2021 and increases in certain retirement benefit plan costs directly linked to our net income in addition our group health and dental costs increased due to increases in costs per claim as well as higher claim volumes per covered employee as a result of these cost increases our employee benefit costs as a percent of salaries and wages increased to 366 in 2021 from 338 in 2020 

operating supplies and expenses increased 1942 million or 520 in 2021 as compared to 2020 due primarily to an increase in our costs for diesel fuel the cost of diesel fuel excluding fuel taxes represents the largest component of operating supplies and expenses and can vary based on both the average price per gallon and consumption the increase in our diesel fuel costs was primarily due to a 603 increase in our average cost per gallon of diesel fuel during 2021 in addition our gallons consumed increased 135 in 2021 as compared to 2020 due to an increase in miles driven we do not use diesel fuel hedging instruments therefore our costs are subject to market price fluctuations our other operating supplies and expenses remained relatively consistent as a percent of revenue between the periods compared

depreciation and amortization costs were relatively consistent in 2021 as compared to 2020 while our capital expenditures were significantly higher in 2021 compared to 2020 our 2021 depreciation and amortization costs were impacted by our planned reduction in capital expenditures for revenue equipment in 2020 as we balanced our fleet with volumes as well as delays in receipt of certain revenue equipment included in our 2021 capital expenditure plan we believe depreciation costs will increase in future periods as we execute our 2022 capital expenditure plan while our investments in real estate equipment and technology can increase our costs in the shortterm we believe these investments are necessary to support our continued longterm growth and strategic initiatives 

 

 

purchased transportation expense increased 878 million or 897 in 2021 as compared to 2020 due primarily to an increase in our use of thirdparty transportation providers to supplement our workforce and equipment as demand for our services increased we expect to continue to purchase supplemental transportation services until the capacity of our team and fleet can fully support our anticipated growth 

our effective tax rate in 2021 was 255 as compared to 254 in 2020 our effective tax rate generally exceeds the federal statutory rate due to the impact of state taxes and to a lesser extent certain other nondeductible items 

liquidity and capital resources

a summary of our cash flows is presented below



the increase in our cash flows provided by operating activities during 2021 as compared to 2020 was impacted by an increase in our income before income taxes of 4871 million which was partially offset by an increase in income taxes paid of 863 million and fluctuations in certain working capital accounts

the decrease in our cash flows used in investing activities during 2021 as compared to 2020 was due primarily to proceeds from the maturities of our shortterm investments in excess of purchases partially offset by increases in real estate and equipment purchases under our capital expenditure plan for 2021 as compared to 2020 changes in our capital expenditure plans are more fully described below in “ capital expenditures ”

the increase in our cash flows used in financing activities during 2021 as compared to 2020 was due primarily to increases in share repurchases and cash dividends paid to shareholders these increases were partially offset by reductions in proceeds from debt issuances and scheduled principal payments during 2021 as compared to 2020 our return of capital to shareholders is more fully described below under “ stock repurchase program ” and “ dividends to shareholders ”

we have five primary sources of available liquidity cash flows from operations our existing cash and cash equivalents shortterm investments available borrowings under our second amended and restated credit agreement with wells fargo bank national association serving as administrative agent for the lenders which we entered into on november 21 2019 the “credit agreement” and our note purchase and private shelf agreement with pgim inc “prudential” and certain affiliates and managed accounts of prudential which we entered into on may 4 2020 the “note agreement” our credit agreement and the note agreement are described in more detail below under “ financing arrangements ” we believe we also have sufficient access to debt and equity markets to provide other sources of liquidity if needed

capital expenditures

the table below sets forth our net capital expenditures for property and equipment including those obtained through noncash transactions for the years ended december 31 2021 and 2020



our capital expenditures vary based upon the projected increase in the number and size of our service center facilities necessary to support our plan for longterm growth our planned tractor and trailer replacement cycle and forecasted tonnage and shipment growth expenditures for land and structures can be dependent upon the availability of land in the geographic areas where we are 

 

 

looking to expand we historically spend 10  15 of our revenue on capital expenditures each year our 2020 capital expenditures were lower than normal  particularly with respect to revenue equipment and real estate  due to economic uncertainty as a result of the covid19 pandemic we expect to continue to maintain a high level of capital expenditures in order to support our longterm plan for market share growth  

we currently estimate capital expenditures will be approximately 825 million for the year ending december 31 2022 approximately 300 million is allocated for the purchase of service center facilities construction of new service center facilities or expansion of existing service center facilities subject to the availability of suitable real estate and the timing of construction projects approximately 485 million is allocated for the purchase of tractors and trailers and approximately 40 million is allocated for investments in technology and other assets we expect to fund these capital expenditures primarily through cash flows from operations our existing cash and cash equivalents shortterm investments and if needed borrowings available under our credit agreement or note agreement we believe our current sources of liquidity will be sufficient to satisfy our expected capital expenditures for the next twelve months and in the longer term 

stock repurchase program

on may 1 2020 we announced that our board of directors had approved a twoyear stock repurchase program authorizing us to repurchase up to an aggregate of 7000 million of our outstanding common stock the “2020 repurchase program” the 2020 repurchase program became effective upon the termination of our 3500 million repurchase program on may 29 2020 on july 28 2021 we announced that our board of directors had approved a new stock repurchase program authorizing us to repurchase up to an aggregate of 20 billion of our outstanding common stock the “2021 repurchase program” the 2021 repurchase program which does not have an expiration date began after the completion of the 2020 repurchase program

under our repurchase programs we may repurchase shares from time to time in open market purchases or through privately negotiated transactions shares of our common stock repurchased under our repurchase programs are canceled at the time of repurchase and are classified as authorized but unissued shares of our common stock

at december 31 2021 our stock repurchase programs had 202 billion remaining available including 625 million that was deferred until final settlement occurred on our accelerated share repurchase agreement in january 2022 following final settlement there is 196 billion remaining available and uncommitted

the credit agreement provides for a fiveyear 2500 million senior unsecured revolving line of credit and a 1500 million accordion feature which if fully exercised and approved would expand the total borrowing capacity up to an aggregate of 4000 million of the 2500 million line of credit commitments under the credit agreement up to 1000 million may be used for letters of credit

at our option borrowings under the credit agreement bear interest at either i libor including applicable successor provisions plus an applicable margin based on our ratio of net debttototal capitalization that ranges from 1000 to 1375 or ii a base rate as defined in the credit agreement plus an applicable margin based on our ratio of net debttototal capitalization that ranges from 0000 to 0375 letter of credit fees equal to the applicable margin for libor loans are charged quarterly in arrears on the daily average aggregate stated amount of all letters of credit outstanding during the quarter commitment fees ranging from 0100 to 0175 based upon the ratio of net debttototal capitalization are charged quarterly in arrears on the aggregate unutilized portion of the credit agreement

for periods covered under the credit agreement the applicable margin on libor loans and letter of credit fees were 1000 and commitment fees were 0100

the amounts outstanding and available borrowing capacity under the credit agreement are presented below 



general debt provisions 

the credit agreement and note agreement contain customary covenants including financial covenants that require us to observe a maximum ratio of debt to total capital and a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio the credit agreement and note agreement also include a provision limiting our ability to make restricted payments including dividends and payments for share repurchases unless among other conditions no defaults or events of default are ongoing or would be caused by such restricted payment we were in compliance with all covenants in our outstanding debt instruments for the period ended december 31 2021

we do not anticipate financial performance that would cause us to violate any such covenants in the future and we believe the combination of our existing credit agreement and note agreement along with our additional borrowing capacity will be sufficient to meet foreseeable seasonal and longterm capital needs

the interest rate is fixed on the note agreement therefore shortterm exposure to fluctuations in interest rates is limited to our credit agreement we do not currently use interest rate derivative instruments to manage exposure to interest rate changes

contractual obligations

the following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations as of december 31 2021



 



 



 

 

 

critical accounting policies

in preparing our financial statements we apply the following critical accounting policies that we believe affect our judgments and estimates of amounts recorded in certain assets liabilities revenue and expenses these critical accounting policies which are those that have or are reasonably likely to have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations are further described in note 1 of the notes to the financial statements included in item 8 of this report

revenue recognition

our revenue is generated from providing transportation and related services to customers in accordance with the bill of lading “bol” contract our general tariff provisions and contractual agreements generally our performance obligations begin when we receive a bol from a customer and are satisfied when we complete the delivery of a shipment and related services we recognize revenue for our performance obligations under our customer contracts over time as our customers receive the benefits of our services in accordance with accounting standards update “asu” 201409 with respect to services not completed at the end of a reporting period we use a percentage of completion method to allocate the appropriate revenue to each separate reporting period under this method we develop a factor for each uncompleted shipment by dividing the actual number of days in transit at the end of a reporting period by that shipment’s standard delivery time schedule this factor is applied to the total revenue for that shipment and revenue is allocated between reporting periods accordingly a hypothetical change of 10 in our percentage of completion estimate would not have a material effect on our recorded revenue

claims and insurance accruals

claims and insurance accruals reflect the estimated cost of various claims including those related to bodily injuryproperty damage “bipd” and workers’ compensation all related costs associated with bipd claims are charged to insurance and claims expense and all related costs associated with workers’ compensation claims are charged to employee benefits expense

insurers providing excess coverage above a company’s selfinsured retention or deductible levels typically adjust their premiums to cover insured losses and for other market factors as a result we periodically evaluate our selfinsured retention and deductible levels to determine the most costefficient balance between our exposure and excess coverage

in establishing accruals for claims and expenses we evaluate and monitor each claim individually and we use factors such as historical claims development experience known trends and thirdparty actuarial estimates to determine the appropriate reserves for potential liabilities we believe the assumptions and methods used to estimate these liabilities are reasonable however any changes in the severity or number of reported claims significant changes in medical costs and regulatory changes affecting the administration of our plans could significantly impact the determination of appropriate reserves in future periods our accrued liability for insurance bipd claims and workers’ compensation claims totaled 1264 million and 1206 million at december 31 2021 and 2020 respectively claims and insurance accruals are discussed further in note 1 of the notes to the financial statements included in item 8 of this report

property and equipment

property and equipment are recorded at cost and depreciated on a straightline basis over their estimated economic lives we use historical experience certain assumptions and estimates in determining the economic life of each asset when indicators of impairment exist we review property and equipment for impairment due to changes in operational and market conditions and we adjust the carrying value and economic life of any impaired asset as appropriate

estimated economic lives for structures are 7 to 30 years revenue equipment is 4 to 15 years other equipment is 2 to 20 years and leasehold improvements are the lesser of the economic life of the leasehold improvement or the remaining life of the lease the use of different assumptions estimates or significant changes in the resale market for our equipment could result in material changes in the carrying value and related depreciation of our assets depreciation expense in 2021 totaled 2599 million a hypothetical change of 1 in the estimated useful lives of all depreciable assets would not have a material impact on our financial results

inflation

most of our expenses are affected by inflation which typically results in increased operating costs in response to fluctuations in the cost of petroleum products particularly diesel fuel we generally include a fuel surcharge in our tariffs and contractual agreements the fuel surcharge is designed to offset the cost of diesel fuel above a base price and fluctuates as diesel fuel prices change from the base which is generally indexed to the doe’s published fuel prices that reset each week volatility in the price of diesel fuel independent of inflation has impacted our business as described in this report however we do not believe inflation has had a material effect on our results of operations for any of the past three years

 

 

related party transactions 

family relationships

john r congdon jr a member of our board of directors is the cousin of david s congdon executive chairman of our board of directors our employment agreement with david s congdon is incorporated by reference as an exhibit to this annual report on form 10k we regularly disclose the amount of compensation that we pay to these individuals as well as the compensation paid to any of their family members employed by us that from time to time may require disclosure in the proxy statement for our annual meeting of shareholders

audit committee approval

the audit committee of our board of directors reviews and approves all related person transactions in accordance with our related person transactions policy




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk

market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact our financial position results of operations and cash flows due to adverse changes in financial market prices and rates

we are exposed to interest rate risk directly related to loans if any under our credit agreement which have variable interest rates a 100 basis point increase in the average interest rate on this agreement would have no material effect on our operating results we have established policies and procedures to manage exposure to market risks and use major institutions that we believe are creditworthy to minimize credit risk

we are also exposed to interest rate risk on our shortterm investments we maintain an investment portfolio principally composed of certificates of deposit us government securities and commercial paper these investments totaled 2544 million and 3303 million at december 31 2021 and 2020 respectively these fixed rate securities are subject to interest rate risk as sharp increases in market interest rates could have an adverse impact on their fair value although the fair values of these instruments can fluctuate we believe that the shortterm highly liquid nature of these debt securities and our ability to hold these instruments to maturity reduces our risk for potential material losses a hypothetical 100 basis point change in market interest rates would have had an immaterial impact on the fair value of these investments at december 31 2021 and 2020

we are exposed to market risk for investments relating to certain assets held within the companyowned life insurance contracts on certain current and former employees the cash surrender value in life insurance contracts included on our balance sheets at december 31 2021 and 2020 was 752 million and 654 million respectively the portion of underlying investments with exposure to market fluctuations was 599 million and 512 million at december 31 2021 and 2020 respectively to provide a meaningful assessment of the market risk for investments relating to companyowned life insurance contracts we performed a sensitivity analysis using a 10 change in market value in those investments on december 31 2021 a 10 change in market value would have caused a 60 million and a 51 million impact on our pretax income in 2021 and 2020 respectively

we are also exposed to commodity price risk related to diesel fuel prices and we manage our exposure to that risk primarily through the application of fuel surcharges to our customers

for further discussion related to these risks see notes 1 2 and 9 of the notes to the financial statements included in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” and item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations”

unless the context requires otherwise references in this report to “old dominion” the “company” “we” “us” and “our” refer to old dominion freight line inc

overview

we are one of the largest north american lessthantruckload “ltl” motor carriers we provide regional interregional and national ltl services through a single integrated unionfree organization our service offerings which include expedited transportation are provided through an expansive network of service centers located throughout the continental united states through strategic alliances we also provide ltl services throughout north america in addition to our core ltl services we offer a range of valueadded services including container drayage truckload brokerage and supply chain consulting more than 98 of our revenue has historically been derived from transporting ltl shipments for our customers whose demand for our services is generally tied to industrial production and the overall health of the us domestic economy

we have increased our revenue and customer base over the past ten years primarily through organic market share growth our infrastructure allows us to provide nextday and secondday service through each of our regions covering the continental united states in addition to numerous service center renovations expansions and relocations of existing service centers we opened 8 19 and 31 new service centers over the past one five and ten years respectively for a total of 244 service centers at december 31 2020 we believe this expansion produced increased capacity within our service center network and provides us with opportunities for future growth

we believe the growth in demand for our services can be attributed to our ability to consistently provide a superior level of customer service at a fair price which allows our customers to meet their supply chain needs our integrated structure allows us to offer our customers consistent highquality service from origin to destination and we believe our operating structure and proprietary information systems enable us to efficiently manage our operating costs our services are complemented by our technological capabilities which we believe provide the tools to improve the efficiency of our operations while also empowering our customers to manage their individual shipping needs

we were founded in 1934 and incorporated in virginia in 1950 our principal executive offices are located at 500 old dominion way thomasville north carolina 27360

our industry

trucking companies provide transportation services to virtually every industry operating in the united states and generally offer higher levels of reliability and faster transit times than other surface transportation options the trucking industry is comprised principally of two types of motor carriers ltl and truckload ltl freight carriers typically pick up multiple shipments from multiple customers on a single truck the ltl freight is then routed through a network of service centers where the freight may be transferred to other trucks with similar destinations ltl motor carriers generally require a more expansive network of local pickup and delivery 

 

 

“ pd ” service centers as well as larger breakbulk or hub facilities in contrast truckload carriers generally dedicate an entire truck to one customer from origin to destination 

significant capital is required to create and maintain a network of service centers and a fleet of tractors and trailers the high fixed costs and capital spending requirements for ltl motor carriers make it difficult for new startup or small operators to effectively compete with established carriers in addition successful ltl motor carriers generally employ and regularly update a high level of technologybased systems and processes that provide information to customers and help reduce operating costs

the american trucking associations reported total transportation revenue in the united states of 9849 billion in 2019 which included approximately 433 billion for the ltl industry based on information reported in transport topics the ltl industry is highly competitive on the basis of service and price and has consolidated significantly since the industry was deregulated in 1980 the largest 5 and 10 ltl motor carriers accounted for approximately 56 and 80 respectively of the ltl market in 2019 we believe consolidation in our industry will continue due to increased customer demand for transportation providers offering both regional and national service as well as other complementary valueadded services

competition

the transportation and logistics industry is intensely competitive and highly fragmented we compete with regional interregional and national ltl carriers and to a lesser extent with truckload carriers small package carriers airfreight carriers and railroads we also compete with and provide transportation services to thirdparty logistics providers that determine both the mode of transportation and the carrier some of our competitors may have a broader global network and a wider range of services than we do competition in our industry is based primarily on service price available capacity and business relationships we believe we are able to gain market share by expanding our capacity in the united states and providing highquality service at a fair price

throughout our organization we continuously seek to improve customer service by among other things maximizing ontime performance and minimizing cargo claims we believe our transit times are generally faster and more reliable than those of our principal national competitors in part because of our more efficient service center network use of team drivers and proprietary technology in addition we provide greater geographic coverage than most of our regional competitors our diversified mix and scope of regional interregional and national ltl service combined with our valueadded service offerings enables us to provide our customers with a single source to meet their shipping and logistics needs we believe the combination of these factors provides us with a distinct advantage over most of our competitors

we utilize flexible scheduling and train our employees to perform multiple tasks which we believe allows us to achieve greater productivity and higher levels of customer service than our competitors we believe our focus on employee communication continued education development and motivation strengthens the relationships and trust among our employees

service center operations

at december 31 2020 we operated 244 service center locations of which we owned 217 and leased 27 our network includes nine major breakbulk facilities located in atlanta georgia columbus ohio indianapolis indiana greensboro north carolina harrisburg pennsylvania memphis and morristown tennessee dallas texas and salt lake city utah while using various other service centers for additional limited breakbulk activity in order to serve our nextday markets our service centers are strategically located throughout the country so that we can provide the highest quality service and minimize freight rehandling costs

our service centers are responsible for the pickup and delivery of freight within their local service area each night our service centers load outbound freight for transport to our other service centers for delivery all inbound freight received by the service center in the evening or during the night is generally scheduled for local delivery the next business day unless a customer requests a different delivery schedule our management reviews the productivity and service performance of each service center on a daily basis to ensure quality service and efficient operations

although we have established primary responsibility for customer service at the local service center level our customers may access information and initiate transactions through our centralized customer service department located at our corporate office or through other electronic gateways our systems allow us to offer our customers access to information such as freight tracking shipping documents rate quotes rate databases and account activity these centralized systems and our customer service department provide our customers with a single point of contact to access information across all areas of our operations and for each of our service offerings

linehaul transportation

linehaul dispatchers control the movement of freight between service centers through integrated freight movement systems we also utilize loadplanning software to optimize efficiencies in our linehaul operations our management team monitors freight 

 

 

movements transit times load factors and many other productivity measurements to help ensure that we maintain our high levels of service and efficiency 

we utilize scheduled routes and additional linehaul dispatches as necessary to meet our published transit times in addition we gain efficiency through the use of twin 28foot trailers in our linehaul operations the use of twin 28foot trailers permits us to transport freight directly from its point of origin to destination with minimal unloading and reloading which also reduces our exposure to potential cargo loss and damage expenses we utilize longcombination vehicles such as triple 28foot trailers and combinations of 48foot and 28foot trailers in states where permitted twin trailers and longcombination vehicles permit more freight to be transported behind a tractor than could otherwise be transported by one trailer

tractors trailers and maintenance

at december 31 2020 we owned 9288 tractors we generally use new tractors in linehaul operations for approximately three to five years and then transfer those tractors to pd operations for the remainder of their useful lives in many of our service centers tractors perform pd functions during the day and linehaul functions at night to maximize tractor utilization

the table below reflects as of december 31 2020 the average age of our tractors and trailers

 



 

we develop certain specifications for tractors and trailers and then negotiate the production and purchase of this equipment with several manufacturers these purchases are planned well in advance of anticipated delivery dates in order to accommodate manufacturers’ production schedules we believe there is sufficient capacity among suppliers to help ensure an uninterrupted supply of equipment to support our operations

the table below sets forth our capital expenditures for tractors and trailers for the years ended december 31 2020 and 2019 for more information concerning our capital expenditures see item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations – liquidity and capital resources” in this report

 



 

at december 31 2020 we operated 42 fleet maintenance centers at strategic service center locations throughout our network these fleet maintenance centers are equipped to perform routine and preventive maintenance and repairs on our equipment

we adhere to established maintenance policies and procedures to help ensure our fleet is properly maintained tractors are routed to appropriate maintenance facilities or authorized repair vendors at designated mileage intervals or every 90 days whichever occurs first trailers are also scheduled for preventative maintenance every 90 days

customers

revenue is generated primarily from customers throughout the united states and north america in 2020 our largest customer accounted for approximately 47 of our revenue and our largest 5 10 and 20 customers accounted for 151 218 and 297 of our revenue respectively for each of our last two fiscal years more than 95 of our revenue was derived from services performed in the united states and less than 5 of our revenue was generated from services performed internationally we believe the diversity of our customer base helps protect our business from adverse developments in a single geographic region and from the reduction or loss of business from a single customer

we utilize an integrated freightcosting system to determine the price level at which a particular freight shipment will be profitable we can modify elements of this freightcosting model to simulate the actual conditions under which the freight will be moved many of our customers engage our services through the terms and provisions of our tariffs and through negotiated service contracts we also compete for business by participating in bid solicitations customers generally solicit bids for relatively large 

 

 

numbers of shipments for a period of one to two years and typically choose to enter into contractual arrangements with a limited number of motor carriers based upon price and service 

seasonality

our tonnage levels and revenue mix are subject to seasonal trends common in our industry although other factors such as macroeconomic changes could cause variation in these trends our revenue and operating margins in the first and fourth quarters are typically lower than those during the second and third quarters due to reduced shipments during the winter months however the effects of the covid19 pandemic on the domestic economy has impacted and may continue to impact our normal seasonal trends more specifically we experienced a decrease in ltl shipments driven by the impact of a slowdown in the domestic economy associated with the covid19 pandemic primarily during the second quarter of 2020 harsh winter weather hurricanes tornadoes floods and other natural disasters can also adversely impact our performance by reducing demand and increasing operating expenses we believe seasonal trends will continue to impact our business 

technology

our technology is critical to the success and delivery of the premium service provided by our operations we continually seek to upgrade and enhance our technological capabilities we also provide access to our systems through multiple secure gateways that offer our customers and employees maximum flexibility and access to information we employ vehicle safety systems onboard computer systems and smart phones freight handling systems and logistics technology to reduce costs and transit times as well as to meet regulatory requirements our data systems are integrated at every level within our organization which we believe is critical to our success our systems are protected through physical and software safeguards as well as redundant systems network security measures and backup systems we continue to focus on the development and enhancement of the technology used in our operations in order to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of our services

insurance

we carry a significant amount of insurance with thirdparty insurance carriers that provides various levels of protection for our risk exposure including protection in the areas of property casualty cyber management and group health with coverage limits and retentiondeductible levels that we believe are reasonable given historical claim activity and severity we believe that our policy of maintaining selfinsured retentions or deductibles under these various insurance programs for a portion of our risks supported by our safety claims management and loss prevention programs is an effective means of managing insurance costs we periodically review our risk exposure and insurance coverage applicable to those risks and believe that we maintain sufficient insurance coverage

diesel fuel availability and cost

we depend heavily upon the availability and quality of diesel fuel to provide our transportation services we maintain fuel storage and pumping facilities at certain service center locations as the primary source for fueling our fleet and we utilize overtheroad fueling options at retail locations as necessary we could be susceptible to regional andor national fuel shortages which could cause us to incur additional expense in order to obtain an adequate supply within our own fueling network or cause us to rely more heavily on higherpriced retail fuel

we believe our operations and financial condition are susceptible to the same diesel fuel price increases or shortages as those of our competitors our fuel surcharge programs are one of many components that we use to determine the overall price for our transportation services our fuel surcharges are generally indexed to fuel prices published by the us department of energy the “doe” that reset each week

human capital

employee profile

as of december 31 2020 we employed 19779 active fulltime employees none of which were represented under a collective bargaining agreement our fulltime employees work in the following roles 



 

 

 

 

employee engagement and benefits

our old dominion family of employees are a key factor in the success of our business the unique od family culture encourages development and employee engagement and motivates our employees to provide the superior customer service for which we are known we believe this culture is part of what attracts employees and helps keep our turnover rates low we also provide our employees with a comprehensive benefits package including a plan that covers our eligible employees’ premium for health insurance a flexible paid time off policy a 401k plan with a guaranteed employer match as well as a discretionary match opportunity and various wellness programs designed to assist employees with establishing and living a healthy and balanced lifestyle 

 

employee development and safety

as of december 31 2020 we employed 5310 linehaul drivers and 4804 pd drivers on a fulltime basis we select our drivers based upon many factors including driving records and experience among other requirements our drivers must pass a drug test have a current us department of transportation “dot” physical and have a valid commercial driver’s license prior to employment once employed drivers are required to obtain and maintain hazardous materials endorsements to their commercial driver’s licenses drivers like all of our employees are required to take preemployment drug and alcohol tests and are randomly selected for periodic additional testing

since 1988 we have provided a nocost opportunity for qualified employees to become drivers through the “old dominion driver training program” there are currently 3069 active drivers who have successfully completed this training which was approximately 303 of our driver workforce as of december 31 2020 we believe our driver training and qualification programs have been important factors in improving our safety record and retaining qualified drivers in addition we have experienced an annual turnover rate for our driver graduates of approximately 63 which is below our companywide turnover rate for all drivers of approximately 80

we also maintain a “management trainee program” and a “supervisor development program” that offers opportunities for our employees to be considered and prepared for sales and management opportunities these programs support our philosophy of promoting from within our highquality workforce

based on driving records our drivers are eligible to be rewarded with annual safety bonuses of up to 3000 per driver our safety bonuses paid to drivers totaled 47 million 46 million and 41 million in 2020 2019 and 2018 respectively

during 2020 the outbreak of covid19 was declared a pandemic by the world health organization throughout the covid19 pandemic we have remained focused on protecting the health and safety of our employees while meeting the needs of our customers we implemented various measures to help ensure the safety and wellbeing of our od family of employees following guidelines issued by the us centers for disease control and prevention and the world health organization we provided personal protective equipment and also implemented increased physical distancing in workspaces and enhanced cleaning protocols across our businesses we continue to take measures to prevent workplace hazards encourage safe behaviors and promote a culture of continuous improvement to ensure our processes help reduce incidents and illnesses and comply with governing health and safety laws 

governmental regulation

we are regulated by the dot and by various state and federal agencies these regulatory authorities have broad powers over matters relating to authorized motor carrier operations as well as motor carrier registration driver hours of service safety and fitness of transportation equipment and drivers transportation of hazardous materials certain mergers and acquisitions and periodic financial reporting the trucking industry is also subject to regulatory and legislative changes from a variety of other governmental authorities which address matters such as increasingly stringent environmental regulations occupational safety and health regulations limits on vehicle weight and size ergonomics port security and driver hours of service

in addition we are subject to compliance with cargosecurity and transportation regulations issued by the transportation security administration “tsa” and customs and border protection “cbp” within the us department of homeland security regulatory requirements and changes in regulatory requirements or guidance may affect our business or the economics of the industry by requiring changes in operating practices that could influence the demand for and increase the costs of providing transportation services

driver hours of service

the federal motor carrier safety administration the “fmcsa” rules provide that a truck driver may work no more than a maximum number of 60 hours within seven consecutive days and 70 hours within eight consecutive days fmcsa rules further impose a maximum work period of 14 hours no more than 11 hours of which may be driving time after first coming onduty 

 

 

following 10 consecutive hours of offduty time fmcsa rules also require that drivers take a 30minute break prior to driving beyond eight hours our drivers utilize electronic logging devices “elds” for the purpose of recording their hours of service 

commercial driver’s license drug and alcohol clearinghouse

we are registered as a motor carrier with the commercial driver’s license drug and alcohol clearinghouse “dac” which requires us to check for drug and alcohol violations of current drivers at least annually and prospective employees prior to hiring we have completed our annual limited query and prehire driver authorization queries

we are subject to future rulemaking by the fmcsa and other regulatory agencies which could be more stringent require additional changes to our operations increase our operating costs or otherwise adversely impact our results of operations

environmental regulation

we are subject to various federal state and local environmental laws and regulations that focus on among other things the disposal emission and discharge of hazardous waste hazardous materials or other materials into the environment or their presence at our properties or in our vehicles fuel storage tanks transportation of certain materials and the discharge or retention of storm water under specific environmental laws we could also be held responsible for any costs relating to contamination at our past or present facilities and at thirdparty waste disposal sites as well as costs associated with cleanup of accidents involving our vehicles we do not believe that the cost of future compliance with current environmental laws or regulations will have a material adverse effect on our operations financial condition competitive position or capital expenditures for the remainder of 2021 or fiscal year 2022 however future changes to laws or regulations may adversely affect our operations and could result in unforeseen costs to our business

 item 1a risk factors

an investment in our common stock involves a variety of risks and uncertainties the following describes some of the material risks that could adversely affect our business financial condition operating results or cash flows we may also be adversely impacted by other risks not presently known to us or that we currently consider immaterial

risks related to our business and operations 

if we are unable to successfully execute our growth strategy and develop market and consistently deliver highquality services that meet customer expectations our business and future results of operations may suffer

our growth strategy includes increasing the volume of freight moving through our existing service center network and selectively expanding our capacity in the united states through market share gains in connection with our growth strategy at various times we have consistently expanded and upgraded service centers purchased additional equipment and increased our sales and marketing efforts and we expect to continue to do so our growth strategy exposes us to a number of risks including the following













 

 

 

we cannot ensure that we will overcome the risks associated with our growth strategy if we fail to overcome those risks we may not realize projected growth and related revenue or profits from our efforts we may incur additional expenses and as a result our financial position and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected

we face various risks related to health epidemics pandemics and similar outbreaks that have had and may continue to have adverse effects on our business results of operations and financial condition

the novel coronavirus covid19 pandemic and the related changes in the economic and political conditions in markets in which we operate have had adverse impacts on our business results of operations and financial condition and on those of our customers and suppliers and these adverse impacts may continue these impacts and potential impacts include among other things significant reductions or volatility in demand for our services inability of our customers to pay for our services and failure of our suppliers or thirdparty service providers to meet their obligations to us we may also experience capacity constraints in one or more geographic areas if a significant number of our employees in any such region are affected by covid19 furthermore covid19 has impacted and may further impact the global economy including negatively impacting the proper functioning of financial and capital markets and interest rates which has impacted the cost of capital and has limited access to capital as the covid19 pandemic continues to adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition it has heightened and will likely continue to heighten other risks to which we are subject including those related to economic downturns customersuppliervendor operations changes in political and regulatory conditions liquidity and industry pricing environment stability as described in further detail in other risk factors despite our efforts to manage our exposure to these risks the ultimate impact of covid19 and similar outbreaks depends on factors beyond our knowledge or control including the duration and severity of any outbreak and governmentalsocial actions taken to contain its spread and mitigate its public health impact

changes in our relationships with significant customers including the loss or reduction in business from one or more of them could have an adverse impact on our business

we do not believe the loss of any one customer would materially impact our business and revenue growth due to the diversity of our customer base and no individual customer accounting for more than 5 of our revenue we do however have a number of customers whose demand for our services is tied to us industrial production or the broader domestic economy that could collectively drive business and revenue growth these customers could experience a decrease in production due to a decrease in the demand for their products as a result of a decline in the us economy or other global economic factors such as the slowdown in the domestic economy associated with the covid19 pandemic they could also use other ltl providers and other modes of transportation such as truckload and intermodal in response to capacity service and pricing issues finally unfavorable publicity about us or our employees particularly given the current environment of instantaneous communication and social media outlets could damage our reputation and result in these customers reducing their demand for our services if these factors resulted in a reduction or loss of business from these customers there could be a material impact on our business and revenue growth

insurance and claims expenses could significantly reduce our profitability

we are exposed to a variety of claims including but not limited to those related to cargo loss and damage property damage personal injury workers’ compensation and healthcare we have insurance coverage with thirdparty insurance carriers but we assume a significant portion of the risk associated with these claims due to our selfinsured retentions and deductibles our operating results could be adversely affected if any of the following were to occur i the number or the severity of claims increases ii we are required to accrue or pay additional amounts because claims prove to be more severe than our original assessment or iii claims exceed our coverage amounts if claims exceed our selfinsured retention or deductible levels insurance companies exit the transportation insurance marketplace or insurance market conditions change insurers could raise premiums for excess coverage to cover their expenses and anticipated future losses coverage also may not be procured or be unavailable for certain claims in addition insurance companies generally require us to collateralize our selfinsured retention or deductible levels if these collateralization requirements increase our borrowing capacity could be adversely affected

limited supply and increased costs of new equipment may adversely affect our earnings and cash flow

we may face difficulty in purchasing new equipment due to decreased supply and increased costs investment in new equipment is a significant part of our annual capital expenditures and we require an available supply of tractors and trailers from equipment manufacturers to operate and grow our business we may also be subject to shortages in raw materials that are required for the production of critical operating equipment and supplies such as shortages in rubber or steel

the price of our equipment may also be adversely affected in the future by regulations on newly manufactured tractors and diesel engines we are subject to regulations issued by the us environmental protection agency the “epa” and various state agencies particularly the california air resources board “carb” that have required progressive reductions in exhaust emissions from diesel engines we may become subject to new or more restrictive regulations or differing interpretations of existing regulations which may increase the cost of providing transportation services or adversely affect our results of operations we are also unable to 

 

 

predict how any future changes in us government policy will affect epa and carb regulation and enforcement these regulations have resulted in higher prices for tractors and diesel engines and increased operating and maintenance costs and there can be no assurance that continued increases in pricing or costs will not have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

we may be adversely impacted by fluctuations in the availability and price of diesel fuel

diesel fuel is a critical component of our operations and a significant operating expense for our business future fluctuations in prices and diesel fuel availability could have a material adverse effect on our operating results diesel fuel prices and fuel availability can be impacted by factors beyond our control such as natural or manmade disasters adverse weather conditions political events disruption or failure of technology or information systems price and supply decisions by oil producing countries and cartels terrorist activities armed conflict world supply and demand imbalances tariffs sanctions and quotas or other changes to trade agreements we maintain fuel storage and pumping facilities at many of our service center locations however we may be susceptible to fuel shortages at certain locations that could cause us to incur additional expense to ensure adequate supply on a timely basis and to prevent a disruption to our service schedules an interruption in the supply of diesel fuel could have a material adverse effect on our operating results

we do not hedge against the risk of diesel fuel price increases an increase in diesel fuel prices or diesel fuel taxes or any change in federal or state regulations that results in such an increase could have a material adverse effect on our operating results we have fuel surcharge programs in place with a majority of our customers which help offset the negative impact of the increased cost of diesel fuel and other petroleumbased products however we also incur fuel costs that cannot be recovered even with respect to customers with which we maintain fuel surcharge programs such as those costs associated with empty miles because our fuel surcharge recovery lags behind changes in fuel prices our fuel surcharge recovery may not capture the increased costs we pay for fuel especially when prices are rising leading to fluctuations in our levels of reimbursement we regularly monitor the components of our pricing including fuel surcharges and address individual account profitability issues with our customers when necessary however there can be no assurance that fuel surcharges can be maintained indefinitely or will be sufficiently effective in offsetting increases in diesel fuel prices

our results of operations may be affected by seasonal factors harsh weather conditions and disasters

our operations are subject to seasonal trends common in our industry our revenue and operating margins in the first and fourth quarters are typically lower than those during the second and third quarters due to reduced shipments decreased fuel efficiency increased coldweather related maintenance costs of revenue equipment and increased insurance and claims costs during the winter months however the effects of the covid19 pandemic on the domestic economy has impacted and may continue to impact our normal seasonal trends harsh winter weather or natural disasters including but not limited to hurricanes tornadoes floods fires earthquakes and storms can also adversely impact our performance by disrupting freight shipments or routes destroying our assets disrupting fuel supplies increasing fuel costs increasing maintenance costs reducing demand and negatively impacting the business or financial condition of our customers any of which could harm our results of operations or make our results of operations more volatile

we have significant ongoing cash requirements that could limit our growth and affect our profitability if we are unable to obtain sufficient capital

our business is highly capital intensive as further described in part ii item 7 of this annual report on form 10k we generally finance our capital expenditures and planned growth with existing cash cash flow from operations issuance of debt including pursuant to our note purchase and private shelf agreement and through available borrowings under our existing senior unsecured credit agreement we may require additional capital to finance longterm real estate purchase opportunities and acquisitions which we may fund through additional debt or through equity offerings if we are unable to generate sufficient cash from our operations or raise capital by accessing the debt and equity markets we may be forced to limit our growth and operate our equipment for longer periods of time which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results

our business also has significant ongoing operating cash requirements if our cash requirements are high or our cash flow from operations is low during particular periods we may need to seek additional financing which could be costly or difficult to obtain

a decrease in the demand and value of used equipment may impact our results of operations

as we purchase new tractors and trailers as part of our normal replacement cycle each year we rely on the used equipment market to dispose of our older equipment oversupply in the transportation industry as well as adverse domestic and foreign economic conditions can negatively impact the demand for used equipment and therefore reduce the value we can obtain on our used equipment if we are unable to sell our older equipment at or above our salvage value the resulting losses could have a significant impact on our results of operations

 

 

we may be unable to successfully consummate and integrate acquisitions as part of our growth strategy 

growth through acquisitions historically has been one of several key components of our ltl growth strategy in the future we may seek to acquire other ltl carriers as well as other complementary businesses exploration of potential acquisitions requires significant attention from our management team in addition we expect to compete for acquisition opportunities with other companies some of which may have greater financial and other resources than we do we cannot ensure that we will have sufficient cash to consummate an acquisition or otherwise be able to obtain financing for an acquisition if we are unable to access sufficient funding for potential acquisitions we may not be able to complete transactions that we otherwise find advantageous

any subsequent acquisition will entail numerous risks including



















in addition we may have difficulty integrating any acquired business and its operations services and personnel into our existing operations and such integration may require a significant amount of time and effort by our management team to the extent we do not successfully avoid or overcome the risks or problems resulting from any acquisitions we undertake there could be a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations

we are subject to various risks arising from our international business operations and relationships which could adversely affect our business

we arrange for transportation and logistics services to and from various international locations and are subject to both the risks of conducting international business and the requirements of the foreign corrupt practices act of 1977 the “fcpa” failure to comply with the fcpa may result in legal claims against us in addition we face other risks associated with international operations and relationships which may include restrictive trade policies the renegotiation of international trade agreements imposition of duties taxes or government royalties imposed by foreign governments which could adversely affect our business

 

antiterrorism measures and terrorist events may disrupt our business

federal state and municipal authorities have implemented and are continuing to implement various antiterrorism measures including checkpoints and travel restrictions on large trucks if additional security measures disrupt or impede the timing of our deliveries we may fail to meet the requirements of our customers or incur increased expenses to do so there can be no assurance that new antiterrorism measures will not be implemented and that such measures will not have a material adverse effect on our operations

risks related to our industry 

we operate in a rapidly evolving and highly competitive industry and our business will suffer if we are unable to adequately address potential downward pricing pressures and other factors that may adversely affect our operations and profitability

our industry faced with requirements for faster deliveries and increased visibility into shipments is rapidly evolving and increasingly competitive numerous competitive factors could impair our ability to maintain our current profitability these factors include but are not limited to the following

 

 





























if we are unable to effectively compete with other ltl carriers whether on the basis of price service brand recognition or otherwise we may be unable to retain existing customers or attract new customers either of which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations furthermore continued merger and acquisition activity in transportation and logistics could result in stronger or new competitors which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations we may not be able to compete successfully in an increasingly consolidated ltl industry and cannot predict with certainty how industry consolidation will affect our competitors or us

our customers’ and suppliers’ businesses may be impacted by various economic factors such as recessions downturns in the economy global uncertainty and instability changes in us social political and regulatory conditions andor a disruption of financial markets which may decrease demand for our services or increase our costs

adverse economic conditions both in the us and internationally can negatively affect our customers’ business levels the amount of transportation services they need their ability to pay for our services and overall freight levels any of which might impair our asset utilization additionally uncertainty and instability in the global economy and any other action that the us government may take to withdraw from or materially modify international trade arrangements including related to the united statesmexicocanada agreement may lead to fewer goods being transported and could have a material adverse effect on our business financial conditions and results of operations the us government has made significant changes in us trade policy and has taken certain other actions that may impact us trade including imposing tariffs on certain goods imported into the united states to date several governments including the european union china and india have imposed tariffs on certain goods imported from the united states any further changes in us or international trade policy could trigger additional retaliatory actions by affected countries resulting in “trade wars” and increased costs for goods transported globally which may reduce customer demand for these products if the parties having to pay those tariffs increase their prices or in trading partners limiting their trade with countries that impose antitrade measures if these consequences are realized the volume of global economic activity may be significantly reduced such a reduction could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition

 

 

customers adversely impacted by changes in us trade policies or otherwise encountering adverse economic conditions including as a result of the covid19 pandemic may be unable to obtain additional financing or financing under acceptable terms these customers represent a greater potential for bad debt losses which may require us to increase our reserve for bad debt economic conditions resulting in bankruptcies of a concentration of our customers could have a significant impact on our financial position results of operations or liquidity in a particular year or quarter further when adverse economic times arise customers may select competitors that offer lower rates in an attempt to lower their costs and we might be forced to lower our rates or lose freight volumes 

our suppliers’ business levels also may be negatively affected by adverse economic conditions and changes in the political and regulatory environment both in the us and internationally or financial constraints including as a result of the covid19 pandemic which could lead to disruptions in the supply and availability of equipment parts and services critical to our operations a significant interruption in our normal supply chain could disrupt our operations increase our costs and negatively impact our ability to serve our customers

we are also subject to cost increases outside of our control that could materially reduce our profitability if we are unable to increase our rates sufficiently such cost increases include but are not limited to increases in wage rates fuel prices interest rates taxes tolls license and registration fees insurance revenue equipment and healthcare for our employees

risks related to labor matters

if our employees were to unionize our operating costs would increase and our ability to compete would be impaired

none of our employees are currently represented under a collective bargaining agreement however from time to time there have been efforts to organize our employees at various service centers further congress or one or more states could approve legislation andor the national labor relations board could render decisions or implement rule changes that could significantly affect our business and our relationship with our employees including actions that could substantially liberalize the procedures for union organization in addition we can offer no assurance that the department of labor will not adopt new regulations or interpret existing regulations in a manner that would favor the agenda of unions or that our employees will not unionize in the future particularly if regulatory changes occur that facilitate unionization

the unionization of our employees could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations because











difficulties attracting and retaining qualified drivers and maintenance technicians could result in increases in driver and technician compensation and could adversely affect our profitability our ability to maintain or grow our fleet and our ability to maintain our customer relationships

recently there has been intense competition for qualified drivers in the transportation industry resulting from a shortage of drivers due in part to the time commitment physical requirements our stringent hiring standards changing workforce demographics and current industry conditions and regulations the available pool of qualified employee drivers has been declining as a result we have faced and may continue to face difficulty maintaining or increasing our number of drivers similarly in recent years there has been a decrease in the overall supply of skilled maintenance technicians particularly new technicians with qualifications from technical programs and schools which has made it more difficult and may continue to make it more difficult to attract and retain skilled technicians the compensation we offer our drivers and technicians is subject to market conditions that may require increases in driver or technician compensation if we are unable to attract and retain a sufficient number of qualified drivers and technicians we could be required to adjust our compensation packages amend our hiring standards or operate with fewer trucks and face difficulty meeting customer demands any of which could adversely affect our growth and profitability

 

 

if we are unable to retain our key employees or if we do not continue to effectively execute our succession plan our financial condition results of operations and liquidity could be adversely affected 

our success will continue to depend upon the experience and leadership of our key employees and executive officers in that regard the loss of the services of any of our key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and liquidity if we are unable to secure replacement personnel who have sufficient experience in our industry and in the management of our business if we are unable to continue to develop and retain a core group of management personnel and execute succession planning strategies or we encounter any unforeseen difficulties associated with the transition of members of our management team our business could be negatively impacted in the future

risks related to cybersecurity and technology matters

our information technology systems are subject to cyber and other risks some of which are beyond our control which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial position

we rely heavily on the proper functioning and availability of our information systems for our operations as well as for providing valueadded services to our customers our information systems including our accounting communications and data processing systems are integral to the efficient operation of our business it is critical that the data processed by these systems remains confidential as it often includes competitive customer information confidential customer payment and transaction information employee records and key financial and operational results and statistics the sophistication of efforts by hackers foreign governments cyberterrorists and cybercriminals acting individually or in coordinated groups to launch distributed denial of service attacks or other coordinated attacks that may cause service outages gain inappropriate or block legitimate access to systems or information or result in other business interruptions has continued to increase in recent years we utilize thirdparty service providers who have access to our systems and certain sensitive data which exposes us to additional security risks particularly given the complex and evolving laws and regulations regarding privacy and data protection while we and our thirdparty service providers have experienced cyberattacks and attempted breaches of our and their information technology systems and networks or similar events from time to time no such incidents have been individually or in the aggregate material to us cyber incidents that impact the security availability reliability speed accuracy or other proper functioning of our systems information and measures including outages computer viruses breakins and similar disruptions could have a significant impact on our operations

we have security processes protocols and standards in place to protect our information systems including through physical and software safeguards as well as redundant systems network security measures and backup systems nevertheless it is difficult to fully protect against the possibility of power loss telecommunications failures cyberattacks and other cyber incidents in every potential circumstance that may arise a significant cyber incident including system failure security breach disruption by malware or ransomware or other damage could interrupt or delay our operations damage our reputation and brand cause a loss of customers expose us to a risk of loss or litigation result in regulatory scrutiny investigations actions fines or penalties andor cause us to incur significant time and expense to remedy such an event any of which could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial position furthermore any failure to comply with data privacy security or other laws and regulations such as the california consumer privacy act and similar laws in the united states at both the federal and state level could result in claims legal or regulatory proceedings inquiries or investigations as cyber threats are continually evolving our controls and procedures may become inadequate and we may be required to devote additional resources to modifying or enhancing our systems in the future furthermore while we maintain insurance intended to address costs associated with aspects of cyber incidents network failures and data privacyrelated concerns our coverage may not sufficiently cover all types of losses or claims that may arise

if we do not adapt to new technologies implemented by our competitors in the ltl and transportation industry our business could suffer

the ltl and transportation industry may be impacted by rapid changes in technologies our competitors may implement new technology that could improve their service price available capacity or business relationships and increase their market share if we do not appropriately adapt our operations to these new technologies our business financial condition and results of operations may suffer

failure to keep pace with developments in technology any disruption to our technology infrastructure or failures of essential services upon which our technology platforms rely could cause us to incur costs or result in a loss of business which may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition

we rely heavily on information technology systems our information technology systems are complex and require ongoing investments and enhancements to meet both internal requirements and the requirements of our customers if we are unable to invest in and enhance or modernize our technology systems in a timely manner or at a reasonable cost or if we are unable to train our employees to operate the new enhanced or modernized systems our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely 

 

 

affected we also may not achieve the benefits that we anticipate from any new technology or new or modernized system and a failure to do so could result in higher than anticipated costs or adversely affect our results of operations 

our information technology systems also depend upon the internet thirdparty service providers global communications providers satellitebased communications systems the electric utilities grid electric utility providers and telecommunications providers we have minimal control over the operation quality or maintenance of these services or whether vendors will improve their services or continue to provide services that are essential to our business disruptions due to transitional challenges in upgrading or enhancing our technology systems failures in the services upon which our information technology platforms rely including those that may arise from adverse weather conditions or natural calamities including but not limited to floods hurricanes earthquakes or tornadoes illegal acts including terrorist attacks human error or systems modernization initiatives andor other disruptions may adversely affect our business which could increase our costs or result in a loss of customers that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition

risks related to legal and regulatory matters

the fmcsa’s csa initiative could adversely impact our ability to hire qualified drivers meet our growth projections and maintain our customer relationships each of which could adversely impact our results of operations

the fmcsa’s compliance safety accountability initiative “csa” is an enforcement and compliance program designed to monitor and improve commercial motor vehicle safety by measuring the safety record of both the motor carrier and the driver these measurements are scored and used by the fmcsa to identify potential safety risks and to direct enforcement action

our csa scores are dependent upon our safety and compliance experience which could change at any time in addition the safety standards prescribed in csa could change and our ability to maintain an acceptable score could be adversely impacted public disclosure of certain csa scores was restricted through the enactment of the fixing america’s surface transportation act of 2015 the “fast act” on december 4 2015 however the fast act does not restrict public disclosure of all data collected by the fmcsa if we receive unacceptable csa scores and this data is made available to the public our relationships with our customers could be damaged which could result in a loss of business

the requirements of the csa could also shrink the industry’s pool of drivers as those with unfavorable scores could leave the industry as a result the costs to attract train and retain qualified drivers could increase in addition a shortage of qualified drivers could increase driver turnover decrease asset utilization limit growth and adversely impact our results of operations

we operate in a highly regulated industry and increased costs of compliance with or liability for violation of existing or future regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business

we are regulated by the dot and by various state and federal agencies these regulatory authorities have broad powers over matters relating to authorized motor carrier operations as well as motor carrier registration driver hours of service safety and fitness of transportation equipment and drivers transportation of hazardous materials certain mergers and acquisitions and periodic financial reporting the trucking industry is also subject to regulatory and legislative changes from a variety of other governmental authorities which address matters such as increasingly stringent environmental regulations occupational safety and health regulations limits on vehicle weight and size ergonomics port security and driver hours of service we are also subject to the costs and potential adverse impact of compliance associated with fmcsa’s eld regulations and guidance including the operation of our fleet and safety management systems on the eld hardware and software platform in addition we are subject to compliance with cargosecurity and transportation regulations issued by the tsa and cbp within the us department of homeland security regulatory requirements and changes in regulatory requirements or guidance together with the growing compliance risks presented by increased differences between applicable federal and state regulations may affect our business or the economics of the industry by requiring changes in operating practices that could influence the demand for and increase the costs of providing transportation services

we are subject to various governmental laws and regulations and costs of compliance with liabilities under or violations of existing or future governmental laws or regulations could adversely affect our business

we are subject to various federal state and local environmental laws and regulations that govern among other things the disposal emission and discharge of hazardous waste hazardous materials or other materials into the environment their presence at our properties or in our vehicles fuel storage tanks the transportation of certain materials and the discharge or retention of storm water under specific environmental laws we could also be held responsible for any costs relating to contamination at our past or present facilities and at thirdparty waste disposal sites as well as costs associated with the cleanup of accidents involving our vehicles environmental laws have become and may continue to be increasingly more stringent over time and there can be no assurance that our costs of complying with current or future environmental laws or liabilities arising under such laws will not have a material adverse effect on our business operations or financial condition

 

 

we may be adversely affected by legal regulatory or market responses to climate change concerns 

increased concern over climate change and the potential impact of global warming has led to an increase in the consideration of greenhouse gas emissions regulation due to increased consideration there could be an increase in regulation from federal state and local governments related to our carbon footprint including with respect to vehicle engine emissions this increase in regulation could result in increased direct costs such as taxes fees fuel or capital costs or changes to our operations in order to comply there is also a focus from regulators and our customers on sustainability issues this focus may result in new legislation or customer requirements such as limits on vehicle weight and size or energy source finally given the increasing focus on esg matters by the investor community if shareholders were to express dissatisfaction with our policies or efforts with respect to climate change sustainability or similar matters there could be a negative impact on our stock price and we could also suffer reputational harm costs associated with future climate change concerns or environmental laws and regulations sustainability requirements and related investor expectations could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations liquidity and cash flows

healthcare legislation may increase our costs for employee healthcare and benefits and reduce our future profitability

to attract and retain employees we maintain a competitive health insurance plan for our employees and their dependents we cannot predict the impact that any state or federal healthcare legislation or regulation will have on our operations but we expect costs associated with providing benefits under employee medical plans and healthcarerelated costs associated with workers’ compensation to continue to increase rising healthcare costs in the us could result in significant longterm costs to us which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results in addition rising healthcare costs could force us to make further changes to our benefits program which could negatively impact our ability to attract and retain employees

we are subject to the risks of litigation and governmental proceedings inquiries notices or investigations which could adversely affect our business

the nature of our business exposes us to the potential for various claims and litigation related to labor and employment personal injury property damage cargo claims safety and contract compliance environmental liability and other matters accordingly we are and in the future may be subject to legal proceedings and claims that have arisen in the ordinary course of our business and may include collective andor class action allegations we are also subject to potential governmental proceedings inquiries notices or investigations which also exposes us to the potential for various claims and litigation the parties in such actions may seek amounts from us that may not be covered in whole or in part by insurance defending ourselves against such actions could result in significant costs and could require a substantial amount of time and effort by our management team we cannot predict the outcome of litigation or governmental proceedings inquiries notices or investigations to which we are a party or whether we will be subject to future legal actions as a result the potential costs associated with any such legal actions against us could adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations

we are subject to legislative regulatory and legal developments involving taxes

taxes are a significant part of our expenses we are subject to us federal and state income payroll property sales and use fuel and other types of taxes changes to tax laws and regulations or changes to the interpretation thereof or the ambiguity of tax laws and regulations the subjectivity of factual interpretations higher tax rates claims audits investigations or legal proceedings involving taxing authorities could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows

risks related to owning our common stock 

our principal shareholders control a large portion of our outstanding common stock

earl e congdon david s congdon john r congdon jr and their affiliate family members beneficially own an aggregate of approximately 18 of the outstanding shares of our common stock as long as the congdon family controls a large portion of our voting stock they may be able to significantly influence the election of the entire board of directors and the outcome of all matters involving a shareholder vote the congdon family’s interests may differ from the interests of other shareholders and the status of their ownership could change at their discretion

we intend to pay a quarterly cash dividend to holders of our common stock for the foreseeable future however dividend payments are subject to approval by our board of directors and are restricted by applicable state law limitations on distributions to shareholders as well as certain covenants under our revolving credit facility and our note purchase and private shelf agreement as a result future dividend payments are not guaranteed and will depend upon various factors such as our overall financial condition available liquidity anticipated cash needs future prospects for earnings and cash flows as well as other factors considered relevant by 

 

 

our board of directors in addition any reduction or suspension in our dividend payments could adversely affect the price of our common stock 

the amount and frequency of our stock repurchases may fluctuate

the amount timing and execution of our stock repurchase program may fluctuate based on our strategic approach and our priorities for the use of cash other factors that may impact share repurchases include changes in stock price profitability capital structure or cash flows our revolving credit facility and our note purchase and private shelf agreement also include provisions that may limit our ability to make payments for share repurchases we may also use cash for investing in strategic assets or dividend payments instead of share repurchases

the market value of our common stock has been and may in the future be volatile and could be substantially affected by various factors

the price of our common stock on the nasdaq global select market changes constantly we expect that the market price of our common stock will continue to fluctuate due to a variety of factors many of which are beyond our control these factors include among others



























our common stock price may continue to fluctuate significantly in the future and these fluctuations may be unrelated to our performance general market price declines or market volatility in the future could adversely affect the price of our common stock and the current market price of our common stock may not be indicative of future market prices

this management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations generally discusses our 2020 and 2019 results and yeartoyear comparisons between 2020 and 2019 discussions of our 2018 results and yeartoyear comparisons between 2019 and 2018 that are not included in this annual report on form 10k can be found in “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” in part ii item 7 of our annual report on form 10k for the fiscal year ended december 31 2019 which was filed with the securities and exchange commission on february 26 2020

 

overview

we are one of the largest north american lessthantruckload “ltl” motor carriers we provide regional interregional and national ltl services through a single integrated unionfree organization our service offerings which include expedited transportation are provided through an expansive network of service centers located throughout the continental united states through strategic alliances we also provide ltl services throughout north america in addition to our core ltl services we offer a range of valueadded services including container drayage truckload brokerage and supply chain consulting more than 98 of our revenue has historically been derived from transporting ltl shipments for our customers whose demand for our services is generally tied to industrial production and the overall health of the us domestic economy

in analyzing the components of our revenue we monitor changes and trends in our ltl volumes and ltl revenue per hundredweight while ltl revenue per hundredweight is a yield measurement it is also a commonlyused indicator for general pricing trends in the ltl industry this yield metric is not a true measure of price however as it can be influenced by many other factors such as changes in fuel surcharges weight per shipment and length of haul as a result changes in revenue per hundredweight do not necessarily indicate actual changes in underlying base rates ltl revenue per hundredweight and the key factors that can impact this metric are described in more detail below









our primary revenue focus is to increase density which is shipment and tonnage growth within our existing infrastructure increases in density allow us to maximize our asset utilization and labor productivity which we measure over many different functional areas of our operations including linehaul load factor pd stops per hour pd shipments per hour platform pounds handled per hour and platform shipments per hour in addition to our focus on density and operating efficiencies it is critical for us to obtain an appropriate yield which is measured as revenue per hundredweight on the shipments we handle to offset our cost inflation and support our ongoing investments in capacity and technology we regularly monitor the components of our pricing including base freight rates accessorial charges and fuel surcharges the fuel surcharge is generally designed to offset fluctuations in the cost of our 

 

 

petroleumbased products and is indexed to diesel fuel prices published by the doe  which reset each week we believe our yield management process focused on individual account profitability and ongoing improvements in operating efficiencies are both key components of our ability to produce profitable growth 

our primary cost elements are direct wages and benefits associated with the movement of freight operating supplies and expenses which include diesel fuel and depreciation of our equipment fleet and service center facilities we gauge our overall success in managing costs by monitoring our operating ratio a measure of profitability calculated by dividing total operating expenses by revenue which also allows for industrywide comparisons with our competition

we regularly upgrade our technological capabilities to improve our customer service and lower our operating costs our technology provides our customers with visibility of their shipments throughout our network increases the productivity of our workforce and provides key metrics that we use to monitor and enhance our processes

results of operations

the following table sets forth for the years indicated expenses and other items as a percentage of revenue from operations

 



 

key financial and operating metrics for 2020 and 2019 are presented below

 



 

despite the difficult operating conditions created by the covid19 pandemic our financial results for 2020 include company records for profitability and diluted earnings per share while our annual revenue decreased slightly as a result of a decrease in our volumes our ltl revenue per hundredweight increased as we maintained our price discipline throughout the year the increase in 

 

 

our yields along with the increase in productivity allowed us to improve our variable operating costs as a percent of revenue we also improved our overhead costs as a percent of revenue due to our control over discretionary spending during the year these factors contributed to the 270 basis point improvement in our operating ratio resulting in a new company record of 774 for the year as a result our net income and diluted earnings per share increased 93 and 114 respectively in 2020 as compared to 2019 

revenue

revenue decreased 940 million or 23 in 2020 compared to 2019 this decline reflects a decrease in ltl tons and a slight decline in our ltl revenue per hundredweight when compared with 2019 the decrease in ltl tons in 2020 was primarily attributable to a decline in shipments that was partially offset by an increase in our ltl weight per shipment the decrease in ltl shipments was driven by the impact of a slowdown in the domestic economy associated with the covid19 pandemic primarily during the second quarter of 2020 

ltl revenue per hundredweight decreased 01 in 2020 compared to 2019 our ltl revenue and yield were negatively impacted by a decrease in fuel surcharges that resulted from a significant decline in the average price of diesel fuel for the comparable periods the slight decrease in ltl revenue per hundredweight also includes the adverse impact of the increase in our ltl weight per shipment on this metric excluding fuel surcharges ltl revenue per hundredweight increased 25 in 2020 compared to 2019 as a result of the ongoing commitment to our yield management strategy which is supported by our bestinclass service to customers as a percent of revenue fuel surcharges decreased to 105 in 2020 as compared to 127 in 2019 

 

january 2021 update

revenue per day increased 146 in january 2021 compared to the same month last year ltl tons per day increased 119 due primarily to a 70 increase in ltl shipments per day and a 46 increase in ltl weight per shipment ltl revenue per hundredweight increased 22 as compared to the same month last year ltl revenue per hundredweight excluding fuel surcharges increased 41 as compared to the same month last year 

operating costs and other expenses

salaries wages and benefits decreased 686 million or 32 in 2020 as compared to 2019 due to a 212 million decrease in the costs attributable to salaries and wages and a 474 million decrease in benefits costs the decrease in salaries and wages was due to a decrease in the average number of active fulltime employees and improvements in productivity these decreases were partially offset by the impact of annual wage increases provided to our employees at the beginning of both september of 2019 and 2020 and two special bonuses provided to eligible employees during 2020 in recognition of their outstanding service to our customers during the covid19 pandemic our average number of active fulltime employees decreased 1530 or 74 as compared to 2019 as we aligned our headcount with shipment volume trends 

our productive labor costs which include wages for drivers platform employees and fleet technicians increased slightly as a percent of revenue to 278 in 2020 as compared to 276 in 2019 while our productive labor costs as a percentage of revenue were negatively impacted by the deleveraging effect of lower fuel surcharges we increased the efficiency of our operations with improvements in our linehaul laden load average pd shipments and stops per hour and platform pounds and shipments per hour as compared to 2019 our other salaries and wages as a percent of revenue also increased slightly to 104 in 2020 as compared to 102 in 2019   

employee benefit costs decreased 474 million in 2020 as compared to 2019 due primarily to a reduction in expense related to our phantom stock plans which were amended in the fourth quarter of 2019 to allow the awards to be settled in stock and limit our ongoing benefits expense in future periods our employee benefit costs were also lower due to a reduction in group health and dental and workers’ compensation resulting from a decrease in employee headcount and fewer claims per employee during 2020 as a result of these expense reductions our employee benefit costs as a percent of salaries and wages decreased to 338 in 2020 from 364 in 2019 

we believe our active fulltime employee count will increase as we continue to hire employees to balance our workforce with growing demand and shipment trends although we intend to hire additional employees in 2021 to further increase the capacity of our workforce we expect to continue to purchase supplemental transportation until the capacity of our team can fully support our anticipated growth 

operating supplies and expenses decreased 997 million or 211 in 2020 as compared to 2019 due primarily to a decrease in our costs for diesel fuel used in our vehicles our diesel fuel costs excluding fuel taxes represents the largest component of operating supplies and expenses and can vary based on both the average price per gallon and consumption our average cost per gallon of diesel fuel decreased 318 in 2020 as compared to 2019 in addition our gallons consumed decreased 45 in 2020 as compared to 2019 due to a decrease in miles driven we do not use diesel fuel hedging instruments therefore our costs are subject to 

 

 

market price fluctuations other operating supplies and expenses improved as a percent of revenue between the periods compared as we efficiently maintained our fleet and managed our other variable operating expenses 

general supplies and expenses decreased 137 million or 110 in 2020 as compared to 2019 due primarily to lower advertising and marketing costs as we controlled our discretionary spending we also benefited from lower travelrelated expenses due to travel restrictions imposed during the covid19 pandemic while we will continue our discipline in controlling discretionary spending in 2021 we anticipate that certain costs that were reduced in 2020 will be restored in future periods 

depreciation and amortization increased 76 million or 30 in 2020 as compared to 2019 while our 2020 capital expenditure plan was lower than in 2019 particularly with respect to revenue equipment and real estate we believe depreciation expense will continue to increase in future periods as we maintain our focus on expanding capacity to support our anticipated growth and longterm strategic initiatives 

our effective tax rate in 2020 was 254 as compared to 253 in 2019 our effective tax rate generally exceeds the federal statutory rate due to the impact of state taxes and to a lesser extent certain other nondeductible items 

liquidity and capital resources

a summary of our cash flows is presented below

 



 

the change in our cash flows provided by operating activities during 2020 as compared to 2019 was impacted by an increase in our income taxes paid of 1092 million and fluctuations in certain working capital accounts which were partially offset by an increase in net income

the changes in cash flows used in investing activities during 2020 as compared to 2019 was primarily due to purchases of shortterm investments in 2020 partially offset by a reduction in capital expenditures as compared to 2019 changes in our capital expenditures are more fully described below in “capital expenditures”

the changes in cash flows used in financing activities for all periods were due primarily to fluctuations in capital returned to shareholders and fluctuations in our longterm debt our financing arrangements are more fully described below under “financing agreements” our return of capital to shareholders is more fully described below under “stock repurchase program” and “dividends to shareholders”  

we have five primary sources of available liquidity cash flows from operations our existing cash and cash equivalents shortterm investments available borrowings under our second amended and restated credit agreement the “credit agreement” and our note purchase and private shelf agreement the “note agreement” our credit agreement and the note agreement are described in more detail below under “financing arrangements” we believe we also have sufficient access to debt and equity markets to provide other sources of liquidity if needed  while the ongoing covid19 pandemic creates some uncertainty for the domestic economy we believe our current sources of liquidity will be sufficient to satisfy our planned capital expenditures and working capital needs 

 

 

capital expenditures 

the table below sets forth our net capital expenditures for property and equipment for the years ended december 31 2020 and 2019

 



 

our capital expenditures vary based upon the projected increase in the number and size of our service center facilities to support our plan for longterm growth our planned tractor and trailer replacement cycle and forecasted tonnage and shipment growth expenditures for land and structures can be dependent upon the availability of land in the geographic areas where we are looking to expand we expect to continue to maintain a high level of capital expenditures in order to support our longterm plan for market share growth

we currently estimate capital expenditures will be approximately 605 million for the year ending december 31 2021 approximately 275 million is allocated for the purchase of service center facilities construction of new service center facilities or expansion of existing service center facilities subject to the availability of suitable real estate and the timing of construction projects approximately 290 million is allocated for the purchase of tractors and trailers and approximately 40 million is allocated for investments in technology and other assets we expect to fund these capital expenditures primarily through cash flows from operations our existing cash and cash equivalents shortterm investments and if needed borrowings available under our credit agreement or note agreement we believe our current sources of liquidity will be sufficient to satisfy our expected capital expenditures 

stock repurchase program

on may 1 2020 we announced that our board of directors had approved a new twoyear stock repurchase program authorizing us to repurchase up to an aggregate of 7000 million of our outstanding common stock the “2020 repurchase program” the 2020 repurchase program became effective upon the termination of our 3500 million repurchase program on may 29 2020 as of which date 215 million remained authorized under the prior program under the 2020 repurchase program we may repurchase shares from time to time in open market purchases or through privately negotiated transactions shares of our common stock repurchased under our repurchase programs are canceled at the time of repurchase and are classified as authorized but unissued shares of our common stock 

during the years ended december 31 2020 and 2019 we repurchased 2507885 and 2403 336 shares of our common stock under our repurchase programs for an aggregate of 3641 million and 2410 million respectively as of december 31 2020 we had 5552 million remaining authorized under the 2020 repurchase program 

dividends to shareholders

 

on february 21 2020 we announced that our board of directors approved a threefortwo split of our common stock for shareholders of record as of the close of business on the record date of march 10 2020 on march 24 2020 those shareholders received one additional share of common stock for every two shares owned in lieu of fractional shares shareholders received a cash payment based on the average of the high and low sales prices of our common stock on the record date

 

all references in this report to dividend amounts have been restated retroactively to reflect this stock split splitadjusted quarterly pershare metrics may not recalculate precisely due to rounding

 

our board of directors also declared quarterly cash dividends that totaled 060 per share for the year ended december 31 2020 and quarterly cash dividends that totaled 045 per share for the year ended december 31 2019

 

 

financing agreements

senior note agreements 

we had an unsecured senior note agreement with a principal amount outstanding of 450 million at december 31 2019 the “senior note” the agreement for the senior note called for a scheduled principal payment of 450 million with an interest rate of 479 on january 3 2021 which was paid in the fourth quarter of 2020 

on may 4 2020 we entered into the note agreement with pgim inc “prudential” and certain affiliates and managed accounts of prudential the note agreement which is uncommitted and subject to prudential’s sole discretion provides for the issuance of senior promissory notes with an aggregate principal amount of up to 3500 million through may 4 2023 pursuant to the note agreement we issued 1000 million aggregate principal amount of senior promissory notes the “series b notes” the proceeds of which are available for capital expenditures share repurchases dividends acquisitions or general corporate purposes   borrowing availability under the note agreement is reduced by the outstanding amount of the existing series b notes and all other senior promissory notes issued pursuant to the note agreement 

the series b notes bear interest at 310 per annum and mature on may 4 2027 unless prepaid principal payments are required annually beginning on may 4 2023 in equal installments of 200 million through may 4 2027 the series b notes are senior unsecured obligations and rank pari passu with our other senior unsecured indebtedness

credit agreement 

on november 21 2019 we entered into our credit agreement with wells fargo bank national association serving as administrative agent for the lenders the credit agreement provides for a fiveyear 2500 million senior unsecured revolving line of credit and a 1500 million accordion feature which if fully exercised and approved would expand the total borrowing capacity up to an aggregate of 4000 million of the 2500 million line of credit commitments under the credit agreement up to 1000 million may be used for letters of credit

at our option borrowings under the credit agreement bear interest at either i libor including applicable successor provisions plus an applicable margin based on our ratio of net debttototal capitalization that ranges from 1000 to 1375 or ii a base rate plus an applicable margin based on our ratio of net debttototal capitalization that ranges from 0000 to 0375 letter of credit fees equal to the applicable margin for libor loans are charged quarterly in arrears on the daily average aggregate stated amount of all letters of credit outstanding during the quarter commitment fees ranging from 0100 to 0175 based upon the ratio of net debttototal capitalization are charged quarterly in arrears on the aggregate unutilized portion of the credit agreement

for periods covered under the credit agreement the applicable margin on libor loans and letter of credit fees were 1000 and commitment fees were 0100

the credit agreement replaced our previous fiveyear 3000 million senior unsecured revolving credit agreement dated as of december 15 2015 as amended on september 9 2016 the “prior credit agreement” for periods in 2019 covered under the prior credit agreement the applicable margin on libor loans and letter of credit fees were 1000 and commitment fees were 0125

the amounts outstanding and available borrowing capacity under the credit agreement are presented below 



 

general debt provisions 

 

the credit agreement and note agreement contain customary covenants including financial covenants that require us to observe a maximum ratio of debt to total capital and a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio the credit agreement and note agreement also include a provision limiting our ability to make restricted payments including dividends and payments for share repurchases unless among other conditions no defaults or events of default are ongoing or would be caused by such restricted payment we were in compliance with all covenants in our outstanding debt instruments for the period ended december 31 2020

 

the interest rate is fixed on the note agreement therefore shortterm exposure to fluctuations in interest rates is limited to our line of credit facility we do not currently use interest rate derivative instruments to manage exposure to interest rate changes

 

 

 

we do not anticipate financial performance that would cause us to violate any such covenants in the future and we believe the combination of our existing credit agreement and note agreement along with our additional borrowing capacity will be sufficient to meet foreseeable seasonal and longterm capital needs

contractual obligations

the following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations as of december 31 2020

 



 



 



critical accounting policies

in preparing our financial statements we apply the following critical accounting policies that we believe affect our judgments and estimates of amounts recorded in certain assets liabilities revenue and expenses these critical accounting policies are further described in note 1 of the notes to the financial statements included in item 8 of this report

revenue recognition

our revenue is generated from providing transportation and related services to customers in accordance with the bill of lading “bol” contract our general tariff provisions and contractual agreements generally our performance obligations begin when we receive a bol from a customer and are satisfied when we complete the delivery of a shipment and related services we recognize revenue for our performance obligations under our customer contracts over time as our customers receive the benefits of our services in accordance with accounting standards update “asu” 201409 with respect to services not completed at the end of a reporting period we use a percentage of completion method to allocate the appropriate revenue to each separate reporting period under this method we develop a factor for each uncompleted shipment by dividing the actual number of days in transit at the end of a reporting period by that shipment’s standard delivery time schedule this factor is applied to the total revenue for that shipment and revenue is allocated between reporting periods accordingly payment terms vary by customer and are shortterm in nature

allowances for uncollectible accounts and revenue adjustments

we maintain an allowance for uncollectible accounts for estimated losses resulting from the failure of our customers to make required payments we estimate this allowance by analyzing the aging of our customer receivables our historical loss experience and other trends and factors affecting the credit risk of our customers including anticipated changes to future performance we determine customer receivables to be past due when payment has not been received by the invoice due date writeoffs occur when we determine an account to be uncollectible and could differ from our allowance estimate as a result of factors such as changes in the overall economic environment or risks surrounding our customers additional allowances may be required if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments we periodically review the underlying assumptions in our estimate of the allowance for uncollectible accounts to ensure that the allowance reflects the most recent trends and factors

we also maintain an allowance for estimated revenue adjustments resulting from future billing corrections customer allowances moneyback service guarantees and other miscellaneous revenue adjustments these revenue adjustments are recorded in our revenue from operations we use historical experience trends and current information to update and evaluate these estimates

 

 

claims and insurance accruals 

claims and insurance accruals reflect the estimated cost of claims for cargo loss and damage bodily injuryproperty damage “bipd” workers’ compensation group health and dental the related costs are charged to insurance and claims expense except for workers’ compensation group health and dental which are charged to employee benefits expense

insurers providing excess coverage above a company’s selfinsured retention or deductible levels typically adjust their premiums to cover insured losses and for other market factors as a result we periodically evaluate our selfinsured retention and deductible levels to determine the most costefficient balance between our exposure and excess coverage

in establishing accruals for claims and expenses we evaluate and monitor each claim individually and we use factors such as historical claims development experience known trends and thirdparty estimates to determine the appropriate reserves for potential liability we believe the assumptions and methods used to estimate these liabilities are reasonable however any changes in the severity of previouslyreported claims significant changes in medical costs and regulatory changes affecting the administration of our plans could significantly impact the determination of appropriate reserves in future periods

property and equipment

property and equipment are recorded at cost and depreciated on a straightline basis over their estimated economic lives we use historical experience certain assumptions and estimates in determining the economic life of each asset when indicators of impairment exist we review property and equipment for impairment due to changes in operational and market conditions and we adjust the carrying value and economic life of any impaired asset as appropriate

estimated economic lives for structures are 7 to 30 years revenue equipment is 4 to 15 years other equipment is 2 to 20 years and leasehold improvements are the lesser of the economic life of the leasehold improvement or the remaining life of the lease the use of different assumptions estimates or significant changes in the resale market for our equipment could result in material changes in the carrying value and related depreciation of our assets

inflation

most of our expenses are affected by inflation which typically results in increased operating costs in response to fluctuations in the cost of petroleum products particularly diesel fuel we generally include a fuel surcharge in our tariffs and contractual agreements the fuel surcharge is designed to offset the cost of diesel fuel above a base price and fluctuates as diesel fuel prices change from the base which is generally indexed to the doe’s published fuel prices that reset each week volatility in the price of diesel fuel independent of inflation has impacted our business as described in this report however we do not believe inflation has had a material effect on our results of operations for any of the past three years

related party transactions

family relationships

each of earl e congdon david s congdon and john r congdon jr are related to one another and served in various management positions andor on our board of directors during 2020 our employment agreement with david s congdon is incorporated by reference as an exhibit to this annual report on form 10k we regularly disclose the amount of compensation that we pay to these individuals as well as the compensation paid to any of their family members employed by us that from time to time may require disclosure in the proxy statement for our annual meeting of shareholders

audit committee approval

the audit committee of our board of directors reviews and approves all related person transactions in accordance with our related person transactions policy




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk

market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact our financial position results of operations and cash flows due to adverse changes in financial market prices and rates

we are exposed to interest rate risk directly related to loans if any under our credit agreement which have variable interest rates a 100 basis point increase in the average interest rate on this agreement would have no material effect on our operating results we have established policies and procedures to manage exposure to market risks and use major institutions that we believe are creditworthy to minimize credit risk

 

 

we are also exposed to interest rate risk on our shortterm investments we maintain an investment portfolio principally composed of certificates of deposit us government securities and commercial paper at december 31  2020 these investments totaled  330 3 million  these fixed rate securities are subject to interest rate risk as sharp increases in market interest rates could have an adverse impact on their fair value although the fair values of these instruments can fluctuate we believe that the shortterm highly liquid nature of these debt securities and our ability to hold these instruments to maturity reduces our risk for potential material losses a hypothetical 100 basis point change in market interest rates at december 31  2020 would have had an immaterial impact on the fair value of these investments 

we are exposed to market risk for investments relating to certain assets held within the companyowned life insurance contracts on certain current and former employees the cash surrender value in life insurance contracts included on our balance sheets at december 31 2020 and 2019 was 654 million and 590 million respectively the portion of underlying investments with exposure to market fluctuations was 512 million and 567 million at december 31 2020 and 2019 respectively to provide a meaningful assessment of the market risk for investments relating to companyowned life insurance contracts we performed a sensitivity analysis using a 10 change in market value in those investments on december 31 2020 a 10 change in market value would have caused a 51 million and a 57 million impact on our pretax income in 2020 and 2019 respectively

we are also exposed to commodity price risk related to diesel fuel prices and we manage our exposure to that risk primarily through the application of fuel surcharges to our customers

 item 1 business

unless the context requires otherwise references in this report to “old dominion” the “company” “we” “us” and “our” refer to old dominion freight line inc

overview

we are a leading lessthantruckload “ltl” unionfree motor carrier providing regional interregional and national ltl services through a single integrated organization our service offerings which include expedited transportation are provided through an expansive network of service centers located throughout the continental united states through strategic alliances we also provide ltl services throughout north america in addition to our core ltl services we offer a range of valueadded services including container drayage truckload brokerage and supply chain consulting more than 97 of our revenue has historically been derived from transporting ltl shipments for our customers whose demand for our services is generally tied to industrial production and the overall health of the us domestic economy

we are the third largest ltl motor carrier in the united states as measured by 2018 revenue according to transport topics  we have increased our revenue and customer base over the past five years primarily through organic market share growth our infrastructure allows us to provide nextday and secondday service through each of our regions covering the continental united states we opened 14 and 26 new service centers over the past five and ten years respectively for a total of 236 service centers at december 31 2019 we believe this expansion produced increased capacity within our service center network and provides us with opportunities for future growth

we believe the growth in demand for our services can be attributed to our ability to consistently provide a superior level of customer service at a fair price which allows our customers to meet their supply chain needs our integrated structure allows us to offer our customers consistent highquality service from origin to destination and we believe our operating structure and proprietary information systems enable us to efficiently manage our operating costs our services are complemented by our technological capabilities which we believe provide the tools to improve the efficiency of our operations while also empowering our customers to manage their individual shipping needs

we were founded in 1934 and incorporated in virginia in 1950 our principal executive offices are located at 500 old dominion way thomasville north carolina 27360

our industry

trucking companies provide transportation services to virtually every industry operating in the united states and generally offer higher levels of reliability and faster transit times than other surface transportation options the trucking industry is comprised principally of two types of motor carriers ltl and truckload ltl freight carriers typically pick up multiple shipments from multiple customers on a single truck the ltl freight is then routed through a network of service centers where the freight may be transferred to other trucks with similar destinations ltl motor carriers generally require a more expansive network of local pickup and delivery “pd” service centers as well as larger breakbulk or hub facilities in contrast truckload carriers generally dedicate an entire truck to one customer from origin to destination

 

significant capital is required to create and maintain a network of service centers and a fleet of tractors and trailers the high fixed costs and capital spending requirements for ltl motor carriers make it difficult for new startup or small operators to effectively compete with established carriers in addition successful ltl motor carriers generally employ and regularly update a high level of technologybased systems and processes that provide information to customers and help reduce operating costs 

according to the american trucking associations the trucking industry accounted for 803 of the 9917 billion total us transportation revenue in 2018 the ltl sector had revenue in 2018 of 613 billion which represented 62 of total us transportation revenue the ltl industry is highly competitive on the basis of service and price and has consolidated significantly since the industry was deregulated in 1980 based on 2018 revenue as reported in transport topics  the largest 10 and 25 ltl motor carriers accounted for approximately 55 and 66 respectively of the total ltl market we believe consolidation in our industry will continue due to customer demand for transportation providers offering both national and regional ltl as well as other complementary valueadded services

competition

the transportation and logistics industry is intensely competitive and highly fragmented we compete with regional interregional and national ltl carriers and to a lesser extent with truckload carriers small package carriers airfreight carriers and railroads we also compete with and provide transportation services to thirdparty logistics providers that determine both the mode of transportation and the carrier some of our competitors may have a broader global network and a wider range of services than we do competition in our industry is based primarily on service price available capacity and business relationships we believe we are able to gain market share by expanding our capacity and providing highquality service at a fair price

throughout our organization we continuously seek to improve customer service by maximizing ontime performance and minimizing cargo claims we believe our transit times are generally faster and more reliable than those of our principal national competitors in part because of our more efficient service center network use of team drivers and proprietary technology in addition we provide greater geographic coverage than most of our regional competitors our diversified mix and scope of regional interregional and national ltl service combined with our valueadded service offerings enables us to provide our customers with a single source to meet their shipping and logistics needs we believe the combination of these factors provides us with a distinct advantage over most of our competitors

we utilize flexible scheduling and train our employees to perform multiple tasks which we believe allows us to achieve greater productivity and higher levels of customer service than our competitors we believe our focus on employee communication continued education development and motivation strengthens the relationships and trust among our employees

service center operations

at december 31 2019 we operated 236 service center locations of which we owned 205 and leased 31 our network includes ten major breakbulk facilities located in rialto california atlanta georgia columbus ohio indianapolis indiana greensboro north carolina harrisburg pennsylvania memphis and morristown tennessee dallas texas and salt lake city utah while using various other service centers for additional limited breakbulk activity in order to serve our nextday markets our service centers are strategically located throughout the country so that we can provide the highest quality service and minimize freight rehandling costs

our service centers are responsible for the pickup and delivery of freight within their local service area each night our service centers load outbound freight for transport to our other service centers for delivery all inbound freight received by the service center in the evening or during the night is generally scheduled for local delivery the next business day unless a customer requests a different delivery schedule our management reviews the productivity and service performance of each service center on a daily basis to ensure quality service and efficient operations

although we have established primary responsibility for customer service at the local service center level our customers may access information and initiate transactions through our centralized customer service department located at our corporate office or through other electronic gateways our systems allow us to offer our customers access to information such as freight tracking shipping documents rate quotes rate databases and account activity these centralized systems and our customer service department provide our customers with a single point of contact to access information across all areas of our operations and for each of our service offerings

linehaul transportation

linehaul dispatchers control the movement of freight between service centers through integrated freight movement systems we also utilize loadplanning software to optimize efficiencies in our linehaul operations our management team monitors freight movements transit times load factors and many other productivity measurements to help ensure that we maintain our high levels of service and efficiency

 

we utilize scheduled routes and additional linehaul dispatches as necessary to meet our published transit times in addition we gain efficiency through the use of twin 28foot trailers in our linehaul operations the use of twin 28foot trailers permits us to transport freight directly from its point of origin to destination with minimal unloading and reloading which also reduces cargo loss and damage expenses we utilize longcombination vehicles such as triple 28foot trailers and combinations of 48foot and 28foot trailers in states where permitted twin trailers and longcombination vehicles permit more freight to be transported behind a tractor than could otherwise be transported by one trailer 

tractors trailers and maintenance

at december 31 2019 we owned 9296 tractors we generally use new tractors in linehaul operations for approximately three to five years and then transfer those tractors to pd operations for the remainder of their useful lives in many of our service centers tractors perform pd functions during the day and linehaul functions at night to maximize tractor utilization

the table below reflects as of december 31 2019 the average age of our tractors and trailers

 



 

we develop certain specifications for tractors and trailers and then negotiate the production and purchase of this equipment with several manufacturers these purchases are planned well in advance of anticipated delivery dates in order to accommodate manufacturers’ production schedules we believe there is sufficient capacity among suppliers to ensure an uninterrupted supply of equipment to support our operations

the table below sets forth our capital expenditures for tractors and trailers for the years ended december 31 2019 2018 and 2017 for more information concerning our capital expenditures see item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations – liquidity and capital resources” in this report

 



 

at december 31 2019 we operated 42 maintenance centers at strategic service center locations throughout our network these maintenance centers are equipped to perform routine and preventive maintenance and repairs on our equipment

we adhere to established maintenance policies and procedures to help ensure our fleet is properly maintained tractors are routed to appropriate maintenance facilities at designated mileage intervals or every 90 days whichever occurs first trailers are also scheduled for preventative maintenance every 90 days

customers

revenue is generated primarily from customers throughout the united states and north america in 2019 our largest customer accounted for approximately 42 of our revenue and our largest 5 10 and 20 customers accounted for 146 201 and 273 of our revenue respectively for each of our last three fiscal years more than 95 of our revenue was derived from services performed in the united states and less than 5 of our revenue was generated from services performed internationally we believe the diversity of our customer base helps protect our business from adverse developments in a single geographic region and from the reduction or loss of business from a single customer

we utilize an integrated freightcosting system to determine the price level at which a particular shipment of freight will be profitable we can modify elements of this freightcosting model to simulate the actual conditions under which the freight will be moved many of our customers engage our services through the terms and provisions of our tariffs and through negotiated service contracts we also compete for business by participating in bid solicitations customers generally solicit bids for relatively large numbers of shipments for a period of one to two years and typically choose to enter into contractual arrangements with a limited number of motor carriers based upon price and service

 

seasonality 

our tonnage levels and revenue mix are subject to seasonal trends common in our industry although other factors such as macroeconomic changes could cause variation in these trends our revenue and operating margins in the first and fourth quarters are typically lower than those during the second and third quarters due to reduced shipments during the winter months harsh winter weather or natural disasters such as hurricanes tornadoes floods fires and other storms can also adversely impact our performance by reducing demand and increasing operating expenses we believe seasonal trends will continue to impact our business

technology

our technology is critical to the success and delivery of the premium service provided by our operations we continually seek to upgrade and enhance our technological capabilities we also provide access to our systems through multiple gateways that offer our customers and employees maximum flexibility and access to information we employ vehicle safety systems onboard and handheld computer systems freight handling systems and logistics technology to reduce costs and transit times as well as to meet regulatory requirements our data systems are integrated at every level within our organization which we believe is critical to our success our systems are protected through physical and software safeguards as well as redundant systems network security measures and backup systems we continue to focus on the development and enhancement of the technology used in our operations in order to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of our services

insurance

we carry a significant amount of insurance with thirdparty insurance carriers but we are exposed to the risk of loss on claims up to the limit for which we hold either a selfinsured retention “sir” or deductible at december 31 2019 we maintained a sir or deductible of 10 million or more with respect to the below casualty and group health coverages







we believe that our policy of maintaining a sir or deductible for a portion of our risks supported by our safety claims management and loss prevention programs is an effective means of managing insurance costs we periodically review our risk exposure and insurance coverage applicable to those risks and we believe that we maintain sufficient insurance coverage

diesel fuel availability and cost

we depend heavily upon the availability and quality of diesel fuel to provide our transportation services we maintain fuel storage and pumping facilities at certain service center locations as the primary source for fueling our fleet and we utilize overtheroad fueling options at retail locations as necessary we could be susceptible to regional andor national fuel shortages which could cause us to incur additional expense in order to obtain an adequate supply within our own fueling network or cause us to rely more heavily on higherpriced retail fuel

we believe our operations and financial condition are susceptible to the same diesel fuel price increases or shortages as those of our competitors we implemented a fuel surcharge program in august 1999 which has remained in effect since that time and is one of many components that we use to determine the overall price for our transportation services our fuel surcharges are generally indexed to fuel prices published by the us department of energy the “doe” that reset each week

 

employees 

as of december 31 2019 we employed 20105 individuals on a fulltime basis none of which were represented under a collective bargaining agreement our fulltime employees work in the following roles 



 

as of december 31 2019 we employed 5415 linehaul drivers and 5108 pd drivers on a fulltime basis we select our drivers primarily based upon many factors including driving records and experience among other requirements our drivers must pass a drug test have a current us department of transportation “dot” physical and have a valid commercial driver’s license prior to employment once employed drivers are required to obtain and maintain hazardous materials endorsements to their commercial driver’s licenses drivers like all of our employees are required to take preemployment drug and alcohol tests and are randomly selected for periodic additional testing

since 1988 we have provided the opportunity for qualified employees to become drivers through the “old dominion driver training program” there are currently 3266 active drivers who have successfully completed this training which was approximately 310 of our driver workforce as of december 31 2019 we believe our driver training and qualification programs have been important factors in improving our safety record and retaining qualified drivers in addition we have experienced an annual turnover rate for our driver graduates of approximately 62 which is below our companywide turnover rate for all drivers of approximately 79

based on driving records our drivers are eligible to be rewarded with annual safety bonuses of up to 3000 per driver our safety bonuses paid to drivers totaled 46 million 41 million and 39 million in 2019 2018 and 2017 respectively

governmental regulation

we are regulated by the dot and by various state and federal agencies these regulatory authorities have broad powers over matters relating to authorized motor carrier operations as well as motor carrier registration driver hours of service safety and fitness of transportation equipment and drivers transportation of hazardous materials certain mergers and acquisitions and periodic financial reporting the trucking industry is also subject to regulatory and legislative changes from a variety of other governmental authorities which address matters such as increasingly stringent environmental regulations occupational safety and health regulations limits on vehicle weight and size ergonomics port security and driver hours of service

in addition we are subject to compliance with cargosecurity and transportation regulations issued by the transportation security administration “tsa” and customs and border protection “cbp” within the us department of homeland security regulatory requirements and changes in regulatory requirements or guidance may affect our business or the economics of the industry by requiring changes in operating practices that could influence the demand for and increase the costs of providing transportation services

driver hours of service

the federal motor carrier safety administration the “fmcsa” rules provide that a truck driver may work no more than a maximum number of 60 hours within seven consecutive days and 70 hours within eight consecutive days fmcsa rules further impose a maximum work period of 14 hours no more than 11 hours of which may be driving time after first coming onduty following 10 consecutive hours of offduty time fmcsa rules also require that drivers take a 30minute break prior to working beyond eight hours 

electronic logging devices

in december 2015 the fmcsa issued a final rule mandating the use of electronic logging devices “elds” to automatically record drivers’ time for hours of service reporting generally carriers were required to comply with these new requirements by december 18 2017 the fmcsa issued guidance that allowed automatic onboard recording devices “aobrds” operating systems such as those we used prior to 2019 to be installed and utilized on eld compliant hardware until december 16 2019 effective december 16 2019 all motor carriers operating commercial motor vehicles are required to be equipped with and their 

 

drivers are required to utilize  elds for the purpose of recording hours of service  we completed the transition of our fleet from an aobrd operating system to a new eld hardware and software platform in advance of the december 16 2019 deadline 

commercial driver’s license drug and alcohol clearinghouse

in december 2016 the fmcsa released a final rule establishing the commercial driver’s license drug and alcohol clearinghouse “dac” the dac is a database that will maintain records of drug and alcohol violations of commercial motor vehicle drivers the dac will require us to check prospective employees for drug and alcohol violations and all current driver employees must be checked at least annually the intent of the clearinghouse is to ensure that drivers cannot conceal drug and alcohol violations by changing jobs or locations compliance with this rule which provides for a threeyear implementation period was required by january 6 2020 we registered as a motor carrier in the dac on october 28 2019

we are subject to future rulemaking by the fmcsa and other regulatory agencies which could be more stringent require additional changes to our operations increase our operating costs or otherwise adversely impact our results of operations

environmental regulation

we are subject to various federal state and local environmental laws and regulations that focus on among other things the disposal emission and discharge of hazardous waste hazardous materials or other materials into the environment or their presence at our properties or in our vehicles fuel storage tanks transportation of certain materials and the discharge or retention of storm water under specific environmental laws we could also be held responsible for any costs relating to contamination at our past or present facilities and at thirdparty waste disposal sites as well as costs associated with cleanup of accidents involving our vehicles we do not believe that the cost of future compliance with current environmental laws or regulations will have a material adverse effect on our operations financial condition competitive position or capital expenditures for the remainder of 2020 or fiscal year 2021 however future changes to laws or regulations may adversely affect our operations and could result in unforeseen costs to our business

 item 1a risk factors

various factors exist that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those projected in any forwardlooking statement in addition to the factors discussed elsewhere in this report we believe the following are some of the important risks and uncertainties that could materially affect our business financial condition or results of operations

we operate in a rapidly evolving and highly competitive industry and our business will suffer if we are unable to adequately address potential downward pricing pressures and other factors that may adversely affect our operations and profitability

our industry faced with requirements for faster deliveries and increased visibility into shipments is rapidly evolving and increasingly competitive numerous competitive factors could impair our ability to maintain our current profitability these factors include but are not limited to the following











 



















if we are unable to effectively compete with other ltl carriers whether on the basis of price service or otherwise we may be unable to retain existing customers or attract new customers either of which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations furthermore continued merger and acquisition activity in transportation and logistics could result in stronger or new competitors which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations we may not be able to compete successfully in an increasingly consolidated ltl industry and cannot predict with certainty how industry consolidation will affect our competitors or us

if our employees were to unionize our operating costs would increase and our ability to compete would be impaired

none of our employees are currently represented under a collective bargaining agreement however from time to time there have been efforts to organize our employees at various service centers further congress or one or more states could approve legislation andor the national labor relations board could render decisions or implement rule changes that could significantly affect our business and our relationship with our employees including actions that could substantially liberalize the procedures for union organization in addition we can offer no assurance that the department of labor will not adopt new regulations or interpret existing regulations in a manner that would favor the agenda of unions or that our employees will not unionize in the future particularly if regulatory changes occur that facilitate unionization

the unionization of our employees could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations because











 

if we are unable to successfully execute our growth strategy and develop market and consistently deliver highquality services that meet customer expectations our business and future results of operations may suffer 

our growth strategy includes increasing the volume of freight moving through our existing service center network selectively expanding our capacity and broadening the scope of our service offerings in connection with our growth strategy at various times we have expanded and upgraded service centers purchased additional equipment and increased our sales and marketing efforts and we expect to continue to do so our growth strategy exposes us to a number of risks including the following













we cannot ensure that we will overcome the risks associated with our growth strategy if we fail to overcome those risks we may not realize projected growth and related revenue or profits from our efforts we may incur additional expenses and as a result our financial position and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected

we may be unable to successfully consummate and integrate acquisitions as part of our growth strategy

growth through acquisitions historically has been one of several key components of our ltl growth strategy in the future we may seek to acquire other ltl carriers as well as other complementary businesses exploration of potential acquisitions requires significant attention from our management team in addition we expect to compete for acquisition opportunities with other companies some of which may have greater financial and other resources than we do we cannot ensure that we will have sufficient cash to consummate an acquisition or otherwise be able to obtain financing for an acquisition if we are unable to access sufficient funding for potential acquisitions we may not be able to complete transactions that we otherwise find advantageous

any subsequent acquisition will entail numerous risks including



















in addition we may have difficulty integrating any acquired business and its operations services and personnel into our existing operations and such integration may require a significant amount of time and effort by our management team to the extent we do not successfully avoid or overcome the risks or problems resulting from any acquisitions we undertake there could be a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations

 

our customers’ and suppliers’ businesses may be impacted by various economic factors such as recessions downturns in the economy global uncertainty and instability changes in us social political and regulatory conditions andor a disruption of financial markets which may decrease demand for our services or increase our costs  

adverse economic conditions both in the us and internationally can negatively affect our customers’ business levels the amount of transportation services they need their ability to pay for our services and overall freight levels any of which might impair our asset utilization additionally uncertainty and instability in the global economy and any other action that the us government may take to withdraw from or materially modify international trade arrangements including related to the united statesmexicocanada agreement which is designed to replace the north american free trade agreement may lead to fewer goods being transported and could have a material adverse effect on our business financial conditions and results of operations the us government has made significant changes in us trade policy and has taken certain other actions that may impact us trade including imposing tariffs on certain goods imported into the united states to date several governments including the european union china and india have imposed tariffs on certain goods imported from the united states any further changes in us or international trade policy could trigger additional retaliatory actions by affected countries resulting in “trade wars” and increased costs for goods transported globally which may reduce customer demand for these products if the parties having to pay those tariffs increase their prices or in trading partners limiting their trade with countries that impose antitrade measures if these consequences are realized the volume of global economic activity may be significantly reduced such a reduction could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

customers adversely impacted by changes in us trade policies or otherwise encountering adverse economic conditions may be unable to obtain additional financing or financing under acceptable terms these customers represent a greater potential for bad debt losses which may require us to increase our reserve for bad debt economic conditions resulting in bankruptcies of one or more of our large customers could have a significant impact on our financial position results of operations or liquidity in a particular year or quarter further when adverse economic times arise customers may select competitors that offer lower rates in an attempt to lower their costs and we might be forced to lower our rates or lose freight volumes

our suppliers’ business levels also may be negatively affected by adverse economic conditions and changes in the political and regulatory environment both in the us and internationally or financial constraints which could lead to disruptions in the supply and availability of equipment parts and services critical to our operations a significant interruption in our normal supply chain could disrupt our operations increase our costs and negatively impact our ability to serve our customers

we are also subject to cost increases outside of our control that could materially reduce our profitability if we are unable to increase our rates sufficiently such cost increases include but are not limited to increases in wage rates fuel prices interest rates taxes tolls license and registration fees insurance revenue equipment and healthcare for our employees

changes in our relationships with significant customers including the loss or reduction in business from one or more of them could have an adverse impact on our business

we do not believe the loss of any one customer would materially impact our business and revenue growth due to the diversity of our customer base and no individual customer accounting for more than 5 of our revenue we do however have a number of customers whose demand for our services is tied to us industrial production that could collectively drive business and revenue growth these customers could experience a decrease in production due to a decrease in the demand for their products as a result of a decline in the us economy or other global economic factors they could also use other ltl providers and other modes of transportation such as truckload and intermodal in response to capacity service and pricing issues if these factors resulted in a reduction or loss of business from these customers there could be a material impact on our business and revenue growth

difficulties attracting and retaining qualified drivers and maintenance technicians could result in increases in driver and technician compensation and could adversely affect our profitability our ability to maintain or grow our fleet and our ability to maintain our customer relationships

recently there has been intense competition for qualified drivers in the transportation industry due to a shortage of drivers due in part to the time commitment physical requirements our stringent hiring standards changing workforce demographics and current industry conditions and regulations the available pool of qualified employee drivers has been declining as a result we may face difficulty maintaining or increasing our number of drivers similarly in recent years there has been a decrease in the overall supply of skilled maintenance technicians particularly new technicians with qualifications from technical programs and schools which could make it more difficult to attract and retain skilled technicians the compensation we offer our drivers and technicians is subject to market conditions that may require increases in driver or technician compensation if we are unable to attract and retain a sufficient number of qualified drivers and technicians we could be required to adjust our compensation packages amend our hiring standards or operate with fewer trucks and face difficulty meeting customer demands any of which could adversely affect our growth and profitability

 

the fmcsa’s csa initiative could adversely impact our ability to hire qualified drivers meet our growth projections and maintain our customer relationships each of which could adversely impact our results of operations 

the fmcsa’s compliance safety accountability initiative “csa” is an enforcement and compliance program designed to monitor and improve commercial motor vehicle safety by measuring the safety record of both the motor carrier and the driver these measurements are scored and used by the fmcsa to identify potential safety risks and to direct enforcement action

our csa scores are dependent upon our safety and compliance experience which could change at any time in addition the safety standards prescribed in csa could change and our ability to maintain an acceptable score could be adversely impacted public disclosure of certain csa scores was restricted through the enactment of the fixing america’s surface transportation act of 2015 the “fast act” on december 4 2015 however the fast act does not restrict public disclosure of all data collected by the fmcsa if we receive unacceptable csa scores and this data is made available to the public our relationships with our customers could be damaged which could result in a loss of business

the requirements of the csa could also shrink the industry’s pool of drivers as those with unfavorable scores could leave the industry as a result the costs to attract train and retain qualified drivers could increase in addition a shortage of qualified drivers could increase driver turnover decrease asset utilization limit growth and adversely impact our results of operations

we operate in a highly regulated industry and increased costs of compliance with or liability for violation of existing or future regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business

we are regulated by the dot and by various state and federal agencies these regulatory authorities have broad powers over matters relating to authorized motor carrier operations as well as motor carrier registration driver hours of service safety and fitness of transportation equipment and drivers transportation of hazardous materials certain mergers and acquisitions and periodic financial reporting the trucking industry is also subject to regulatory and legislative changes from a variety of other governmental authorities which address matters such as increasingly stringent environmental regulations occupational safety and health regulations limits on vehicle weight and size ergonomics port security and driver hours of service we are also subject to the costs and potential adverse impact of compliance associated with fmcsa’s eld regulations and guidance including the operation of our fleet and safety management systems on the eld hardware and software platform in addition we are subject to compliance with cargosecurity and transportation regulations issued by the tsa and cbp within the us department of homeland security regulatory requirements and changes in regulatory requirements or guidance together with the growing compliance risks presented by increased differences between applicable federal and state regulations may affect our business or the economics of the industry by requiring changes in operating practices that could influence the demand for and increase the costs of providing transportation services

if we do not adapt to new technologies implemented by our competitors in the ltl and transportation industry our business could suffer

the ltl and transportation industry may be impacted by rapid changes in technologies our competitors may implement new technology that could improve their service price available capacity or business relationships and increase their market share if we do not appropriately adapt our operations to these new technologies our business financial condition and results of operations may suffer

insurance and claims expenses could significantly reduce our profitability

we are exposed to claims related to cargo loss and damage property damage personal injury workers’ compensation group health and group dental we have insurance coverage with thirdparty insurance carriers but we assume a significant portion of the risk associated with these claims due to our sirs and deductibles our operating results could be adversely affected if any of the following were to occur i the number or the severity of claims increases ii we are required to accrue or pay additional amounts because claims prove to be more severe than our original assessment or iii claims exceed our coverage amounts if claims exceed our sir or deductible levels insurance companies exit the transportation insurance marketplace or insurance market conditions change insurers could raise premiums for excess coverage to cover their expenses and anticipated future losses in addition insurance companies generally require us to collateralize our sir or deductible levels if these collateralization requirements increase our borrowing capacity could be adversely affected

healthcare legislation may increase our costs and reduce our future profitability

to attract and retain employees we maintain a competitive health insurance plan for our employees and their dependents we cannot predict the impact that any state or federal healthcare legislation or regulation will have on our operations but we expect costs associated with providing benefits under employee medical plans and healthcarerelated costs associated with workers’ compensation to continue to increase rising healthcare costs in the us could result in significant longterm costs to us which could have a 

 

material adverse effect on our operating results in addition rising healthcare costs could force us to make further changes to our benefits program which could negatively impact our ability to attract and retain employees 

we have significant ongoing cash requirements that could limit our growth and affect our profitability if we are unable to obtain sufficient capital

our business is highly capital intensive we generally finance our capital expenditures and planned growth with existing cash cash flow from operations issuance of debt and through available borrowings under our existing senior unsecured credit agreement we may require additional capital to finance longterm real estate purchase opportunities and acquisitions which we may fund through additional debt or through equity offerings if we are unable to generate sufficient cash from our operations or raise capital by accessing the debt and equity markets we may be forced to limit our growth and operate our equipment for longer periods of time which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results

our business also has significant ongoing operating cash requirements if our cash requirements are high or our cash flow from operations is low during particular periods we may need to seek additional financing which could be costly or difficult to obtain

limited supply and increased costs of new equipment may adversely affect our earnings and cash flow

we may face difficulty in purchasing new equipment due to decreased supply and increased costs investment in new equipment is a significant part of our annual capital expenditures and we require an available supply of tractors and trailers from equipment manufacturers to operate and grow our business we may also be subject to shortages in raw materials that are required for the production of critical operating equipment and supplies such as shortages in rubber or steel

the price of our equipment may also be adversely affected in the future by regulations on newly manufactured tractors and diesel engines we are subject to regulations issued by the us environmental protection agency the “epa” and various state agencies particularly the california air resources board “carb” that have required progressive reductions in exhaust emissions from diesel engines we may become subject to new or more restrictive regulations or differing interpretations of existing regulations which may increase the cost of providing transportation services or adversely affect our results of operations we are also unable to predict how any future changes in us government policy will affect epa and carb regulation and enforcement these regulations have resulted in higher prices for tractors and diesel engines and increased operating and maintenance costs and there can be no assurance that continued increases in pricing or costs will not have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations

we may be adversely impacted by fluctuations in the availability and price of diesel fuel

diesel fuel is a critical component of our operations and a significant operating expense for our business future fluctuations in prices and diesel fuel availability could have a material adverse effect on our operating results diesel fuel prices and fuel availability can be impacted by factors beyond our control such as natural or manmade disasters adverse weather conditions political events disruption or failure of technology or information systems price and supply decisions by oil producing countries and cartels terrorist activities armed conflict world supply and demand imbalances tariffs sanctions and quotas or other changes to trade agreements we maintain fuel storage and pumping facilities at many of our service center locations however we may be susceptible to fuel shortages at certain locations that could cause us to incur additional expense to ensure adequate supply on a timely basis and to prevent a disruption to our service schedules an interruption in the supply of diesel fuel could have a material adverse effect on our operating results 

we do not hedge against the risk of diesel fuel price increases an increase in diesel fuel prices or diesel fuel taxes or any change in federal or state regulations that results in such an increase could have a material adverse effect on our operating results we have fuel surcharge programs in place with a majority of our customers which help offset the negative impact of the increased cost of diesel fuel and other petroleumbased products however we also incur fuel costs that cannot be recovered even with respect to customers with which we maintain fuel surcharge programs such as those costs associated with empty miles or the time during which our engines are idling because our fuel surcharge recovery lags behind changes in fuel prices our fuel surcharge recovery may not capture the increased costs we pay for fuel especially when prices are rising leading to fluctuations in our levels of reimbursement we regularly monitor the components of our pricing including fuel surcharges and address individual account profitability issues with our customers when necessary however there can be no assurance that fuel surcharges can be maintained indefinitely or will be sufficiently effective in offsetting increases in diesel fuel prices

we are subject to various governmental laws and regulations and costs of compliance with liabilities under or violations of existing or future governmental laws or regulations could adversely affect our business

we are subject to various federal state and local environmental laws and regulations that govern among other things the disposal emission and discharge of hazardous waste hazardous materials or other materials into the environment their presence at our properties or in our vehicles fuel storage tanks the transportation of certain materials and the discharge or retention of storm 

 

water under specific environmental laws we could also be held responsible for any costs relating to contamination at our past or present facilities and at thirdparty waste disposal sites as well as costs associated with the cleanup of accidents involving our vehicles environmental laws have become and may continue to be increasingly more stringent over time and there can be no assurance that our costs of complying with current or future environmental laws or liabilities arising under such laws will not have a material adverse effect on our business operations or financial condition 

we may be adversely affected by legal regulatory or market responses to climate change concerns

increased concern over climate change and the potential impact of global warming has led to an increase in the consideration of greenhouse gas emissions regulation due to increased consideration there could be an increase in regulation from federal state and local governments on vehicle engine emissions this increase in regulation could result in increased direct costs such as taxes fees fuel or capital costs or changes to our operations in order to comply there is also a focus from regulators and our customers on sustainability issues this focus may result in new legislation or customer requirements such as limits on vehicle weight and size costs associated with future climate change concerns or environmental laws and regulations and sustainability requirements could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations liquidity and cash flows

we are subject to the risks of litigation and governmental proceedings inquiries notices or investigations which could adversely affect our business

the nature of our business exposes us to the potential for various claims and litigation related to labor and employment personal injury property damage cargo claims safety and contract compliance environmental liability and other matters accordingly we are and in the future may be subject to legal proceedings and claims that have arisen in the ordinary course of our business and may include collective andor class action allegations we are also subject to potential governmental proceedings inquiries notices or investigations which also exposes us to the potential for various claims the parties in such actions may seek amounts from us that may not be covered in whole or in part by insurance defending ourselves against such actions could result in significant costs and could require a substantial amount of time and effort by our management team we cannot predict the outcome of litigation or governmental proceedings inquiries notices or investigations to which we are a party or whether we will be subject to future legal actions as a result the potential costs associated with any such legal actions against us could adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations

we are subject to various risks arising from our international business operations and relationships which could adversely affect our business

we arrange for transportation and logistics services to and from various international locations and are subject to both the risks of conducting international business and the requirements of the foreign corrupt practices act of 1977 the “fcpa” failure to comply with the fcpa may result in legal claims against us in addition we face other risks associated with international operations and relationships which may include restrictive trade policies the renegotiation of international trade agreements imposition of duties taxes or government royalties imposed by foreign governments which could adversely affect our business

we are subject to legislative regulatory and legal developments involving taxes

taxes are a significant part of our expenses we are subject to us federal and state income payroll property sales and use fuel and other types of taxes the tax cuts and jobs act the “tax act” which was enacted on december 22 2017 significantly changed the us corporate income tax system further changes to tax laws and regulations or changes to the interpretation thereof including regulations and interpretations pertaining to the tax act the ambiguity of tax laws and regulations the subjectivity of factual interpretations higher tax rates claims audits investigations or legal proceedings involving taxing authorities could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows

our results of operations may be affected by seasonal factors harsh weather conditions and disasters

our operations are subject to seasonal trends common in our industry our revenue and operating margins in the first and fourth quarters are typically lower than those during the second and third quarters due to reduced shipments decreased fuel efficiency increased coldweather related maintenance costs of revenue equipment and increased insurance and claims costs during the winter months harsh winter weather or natural disasters such as hurricanes tornadoes floods fires earthquakes and storms can also adversely impact our performance by disrupting freight shipments or routes destroying our assets disrupting fuel supplies increasing fuel costs increasing maintenance costs reducing demand and negatively impacting the business or financial condition of our customers any of which could harm our results of operations or make our results of operations more volatile

 

if we are unable to retain our key employees or if we do not continue to effectively execute our succession plan our financial condition results of operations and liquidity could be adversely affected 

our success will continue to depend upon the experience and leadership of our key employees and executive officers in that regard the loss of the services of any of our key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and liquidity if we are unable to secure replacement personnel who have sufficient experience in our industry and in the management of our business if we are unable to continue to develop and retain a core group of management personnel and execute succession planning strategies or we encounter any unforeseen difficulties associated with the transition of members of our management team our business could be negatively impacted in the future

our principal shareholders control a large portion of our outstanding common stock

earl e congdon david s congdon john r congdon jr and their affiliate family members beneficially own an aggregate of approximately 18 of the outstanding shares of our common stock as long as the congdon family controls a large portion of our voting stock they may be able to significantly influence the election of the entire board of directors and the outcome of all matters involving a shareholder vote the congdon family’s interests may differ from the interests of other shareholders and the status of their ownership could change at their discretion

our financial results may be adversely impacted by potential future changes in accounting practices

future changes in accounting standards or practices and related legal and regulatory interpretations of those changes may adversely impact public companies in general the transportation industry or our operations specifically new accounting standards or requirements could change the way we record revenues expenses assets andor liabilities or could be costly to implement these types of regulations could have a negative impact on our financial position liquidity results of operations andor access to capital

our information technology systems are subject to cyber and other risks some of which are beyond our control which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial position

we rely heavily on the proper functioning and availability of our information systems for our operations as well as for providing valueadded services to our customers our information systems including our accounting communications and data processing systems are integral to the efficient operation of our business it is critical that the data processed by these systems remain confidential as it often includes competitive customer information confidential customer credit card and transaction data employee records and key financial and operational results and statistics the sophistication of efforts by hackers foreign governments cyberterrorists and cybercriminals acting individually or in coordinated groups to launch distributed denial of service attacks or other coordinated attacks that may cause service outages gain inappropriate or block legitimate access to systems or information or result in other business interruptions has continued to increase in recent years we utilize thirdparty service providers who have access to our systems and certain sensitive data which exposes us to additional security risks particularly given the complex and evolving laws and regulations regarding privacy and data protection while we and our thirdparty service providers have experienced cyberattacks and attempted breaches of our and their information technology systems and networks or similar events from time to time no such incidents have been individually or in the aggregate material to us cyber incidents that impact the security availability reliability speed accuracy or other proper functioning of our systems information and measures including outages computer viruses breakins and similar disruptions could have a significant impact on our operations 

we have security processes protocols and standards in place to protect our information systems including through physical and software safeguards as well as redundant systems network security measures and backup systems nevertheless it is difficult to fully protect against the possibility of power loss telecommunications failures cyberattacks and other cyber incidents in every potential circumstance that may arise a significant cyber incident including system failure security breach disruption by malware or ransomware or other damage could interrupt or delay our operations damage our reputation and brand cause a loss of customers expose us to a risk of loss or litigation result in regulatory scrutiny investigations actions fines or penalties andor cause us to incur significant time and expense to remedy such an event any of which could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial position furthermore any failure to comply with data privacy security or other laws and regulations such as the california consumer privacy act which took effect in january 2020 could result in claims legal or regulatory proceedings inquiries or investigations as cyber threats are continually evolving our controls and procedures may become inadequate and we may be required to devote additional resources to modifying or enhancing our systems in the future furthermore while we maintain insurance intended to address costs associated with aspects of cyber incidents network failures and data privacyrelated concerns our coverage may not sufficiently cover all types of losses or claims that may arise

 

failure to keep pace with developments in technology any disruption to our technology infrastructure or failures of essential services upon which our technology platforms rely could cause us to incur costs or result in a loss of business which may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

we rely heavily on information technology systems our information technology systems are complex and require ongoing investments and enhancements to meet both internal requirements and the requirements of our customers if we are unable to invest in and enhance or modernize our technology systems in a timely manner or at a reasonable cost or if we are unable to train our employees to operate the new enhanced or modernized systems our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected we also may not achieve the benefits that we anticipate from any new technology or new or modernized system and a failure to do so could result in higher than anticipated costs or adversely affect our results of operations

our information technology systems also depend upon the internet thirdparty service providers global communications providers satellitebased communications systems the electric utilities grid electric utility providers and telecommunications providers we have minimal control over the operation quality or maintenance of these services or whether vendors will improve their services or continue to provide services that are essential to our business disruptions due to transitional challenges in upgrading or enhancing our technology systems failures in the services upon which our information technology platforms rely including those that may arise from adverse weather conditions or natural calamities such as floods hurricanes earthquakes or tornadoes illegal acts including terrorist attacks human error or systems modernization initiatives andor other disruptions may adversely affect our business which could increase our costs or result in a loss of customers that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position

damage to our reputation through unfavorable publicity could adversely affect our financial condition

our reputation and the value of the old dominion brand are integral to the success of our business in the current environment of instantaneous communication and social media outlets the quick and broad dissemination of information through media sources could cause damaging information about us whether accurate or not to be broadly publicized unfavorable publicity about us or our employees could damage our reputation and the value of the old dominion brand and may result in a reduction in demand for our services or the loss of customers our reputation could also be impacted by negative perceptions or publicity regarding esg issues or cybersecurity and data privacy concerns any unfavorable publicity and resulting erosion of trust and confidence could make it difficult for us to attract and retain customers and employees or require us to allocate significant resources to the rebuilding of our reputation and brand any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations

antiterrorism measures and terrorist events may disrupt our business

federal state and municipal authorities have implemented and are continuing to implement various antiterrorism measures including checkpoints and travel restrictions on large trucks if additional security measures disrupt or impede the timing of our deliveries we may fail to meet the requirements of our customers or incur increased expenses to do so there can be no assurance that new antiterrorism measures will not be implemented and that such measures will not have a material adverse effect on our operations

a decrease in the demand and value of used equipment may impact our results of operations

as we purchase new tractors and trailers as part of our normal replacement cycle each year we rely on the used equipment market to dispose of our older equipment oversupply in the transportation industry as well as adverse domestic and foreign economic conditions can negatively impact the demand for used equipment and therefore reduce the value we can obtain on our used equipment if we are unable to sell our older equipment at or above our salvage value the resulting losses could have a significant impact on our results of operations

if we raise additional capital in the future your ownership in us could be diluted

any issuance of equity we may undertake in the future to raise additional capital could cause the price of our common stock to decline or require us to issue shares at a price that is lower than that paid by holders of our common stock in the past which would result in those newly issued shares being dilutive if we obtain funds through a credit facility or through the issuance of debt or preferred securities these obligations and securities would likely have rights senior to your rights as a common shareholder which could impair the value of our common stock

there can be no assurance of our ability to declare and pay cash dividends in future periods

we intend to pay a quarterly cash dividend to holders of our common stock for the foreseeable future however dividend payments are subject to approval by our board of directors and are restricted by applicable state law limitations on distributions to shareholders as well as certain covenants under our revolving credit facility as a result future dividend payments are not guaranteed and will depend upon various factors such as our overall financial condition available liquidity anticipated cash needs future 

 

prospects for earnings and cash flows as well as other factors considered relevant by our board of directors in addition any reduction or suspension in our dividend payments could adversely affect the price of our common stock 

the amount and frequency of our stock repurchases may fluctuate

the amount timing and execution of our stock repurchase program may fluctuate based on our strategic approach and our priorities for the use of cash other factors that may impact share repurchases include changes in stock price profitability capital structure or cash flows our revolving credit facility also includes a provision that may limit our ability to make payments for share repurchases we may also use cash for investing in strategic assets or dividend payments instead of share repurchases

the market value of our common stock has been and may in the future be volatile and could be substantially affected by various factors

the price of our common stock on the nasdaq global select market changes constantly we expect that the market price of our common stock will continue to fluctuate due to a variety of factors many of which are beyond our control these factors include among others























our common stock price may continue to fluctuate significantly in the future and these fluctuations may be unrelated to our performance general market price declines or market volatility in the future could adversely affect the price of our common stock and the current market price of our common stock may not be indicative of future market prices

our articles of incorporation our bylaws and virginia law contain provisions that could discourage delay or prevent a change in our control or our management

provisions of our articles of incorporation bylaws and the laws of virginia the state in which we are incorporated may discourage delay or prevent a change in control of us or a change in management that shareholders may consider favorable these provisions

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations

overview

we are a leading lessthantruckload “ltl” unionfree motor carrier providing regional interregional and national ltl services through a single integrated organization our service offerings which include expedited transportation are provided through an expansive network of service centers located throughout the continental united states through strategic alliances we also provide ltl services throughout north america in addition to our core ltl services we offer a range of valueadded services including container drayage truckload brokerage and supply chain consulting more than 97 of our revenue has historically been derived from transporting ltl shipments for our customers whose demand for our services is generally tied to industrial production and the overall health of the us domestic economy

in analyzing the components of our revenue we monitor changes and trends in our ltl volumes and ltl revenue per hundredweight while ltl revenue per hundredweight is a yield measurement it is also a commonlyused indicator for general pricing trends in the ltl industry this yield metric is not a true measure of price however as it can be influenced by many other factors such as changes in fuel surcharges weight per shipment and length of haul as a result changes in revenue per hundredweight do not necessarily indicate actual changes in underlying base rates ltl revenue per hundredweight and the key factors that can impact this metric are described in more detail below







our primary revenue focus is to increase density which is shipment and tonnage growth within our existing infrastructure increases in density allow us to maximize our asset utilization and labor productivity which we measure over many different functional areas of our operations including linehaul load factor pd stops per hour pd shipments per hour platform pounds handled per hour and platform shipments per hour in addition to our focus on density and operating efficiencies it is critical for us to obtain an appropriate yield which is measured as revenue per hundredweight on the shipments we handle to offset our cost inflation and support our ongoing investments in capacity and technology we regularly monitor the components of our pricing including base freight rates accessorial charges and fuel surcharges the fuel surcharge is generally designed to offset fluctuations in the cost of our petroleumbased products and is indexed to diesel fuel prices published by the us department of energy which reset each week we believe our yield management process focused on individual account profitability and ongoing improvements in operating efficiencies are both key components of our ability to produce profitable growth

our primary cost elements are direct wages and benefits associated with the movement of freight operating supplies and expenses which include diesel fuel and depreciation of our equipment fleet and service center facilities we gauge our overall success in managing costs by monitoring our operating ratio a measure of profitability calculated by dividing total operating expenses by revenue which also allows for industrywide comparisons with our competition

 

we regularly upgrade our technological capabilities to improve our customer service and lower our operating costs our technology provides our customers with visibility of their shipments throughout our network increases the productivity of our workforce and provides key metrics that we use to monitor and enhance our processes 

results of operations

the following table sets forth for the years indicated expenses and other items as a percentage of revenue from operations

 



old dominion faced many challenges in 2019 yet we were still able to produce new company records for revenue net income and earnings per diluted share our consistent focus on revenue quality resulted in yield improvement that more than offset the decrease in our ltl tons while we had originally anticipated growth in ltl tons for the year we believe the decrease was attributable to the sluggish economy and increased price competition in our industry with declining volumes our focus intensified on managing our variable costs and improving productivity as a result of our cost management initiatives our operating ratio of 801 was only slightly higher than the company record in 2018 despite a significant increase in our fringe benefit costs associated with the 537 increase in our share price during the year net income increased at the same rate of our revenue growth and earnings per diluted share increased 38 to 766

2019 compared to 2018

key financial and operating metrics for 2019 and 2018 are presented below

 



 

1  intercity mile statistics for 2018 have been adjusted to exclude miles related to nonltl shipments 

 

 

revenue 

revenue increased 654 million or 16 as compared to 2018 due to a 728 million increase in ltl revenue partially offset by a 74 million decrease in nonltl revenue ltl revenue was higher in 2019 due to an increase in ltl revenue per hundredweight that was partially offset by a decrease in volumes the reduction in ltl tons during 2019 resulted from decreases in both ltl weight per shipment and ltl shipments despite the decrease in volumes we believe that our superior service allowed us to increase our market share while also maintaining our price discipline during the year

ltl revenue per hundredweight increased 65 to 2264 in 2019 as compared to 2018 we believe this increase reflects our continued focus on the consistent execution of our yield management process as well as the 23 decrease in ltl weight per shipment our ltl revenue and yield were negatively impacted by a decrease in fuel surcharges in 2019 that resulted from a decrease in the average price of diesel fuel excluding fuel surcharges ltl revenue per hundredweight increased 73 to 1972 in 2019 compared to 2018 as a percent of revenue fuel surcharges decreased to 127 in 2019 as compared to 133 in 2018

 

january 2020 update

 

revenue per day increased 02 in january 2020 compared to the same month last year ltl tons per day decreased 36 due primarily to a 25 decrease in ltl shipments per day and a 11 decrease in ltl weight per shipment ltl revenue per hundredweight increased approximately 42 as compared to the same month last year ltl revenue per hundredweight excluding fuel surcharges increased approximately 41 as compared to the same month last year

operating costs and other expenses

salaries wages and benefits increased 469 million or 23 in 2019 as compared to 2018 due primarily to a 455 million increase in employee benefit costs salaries and wages remained consistent between the periods compared as annual wage increases provided to our employees at the beginning of both september 2018 and 2019 were offset by a decrease in performancebased compensation and an improvement in productivity in addition our average number of fulltime employees decreased 04 in 2019 as compared to 2018 due primarily to the decrease in ltl shipments productivity improvements for the year included increases in both platform and pd shipments per hour while our linehaul laden load average declined slightly due primarily to the decrease in weight per shipment as a result our productive labor costs which include drivers dock workers and technicians improved as a percent of revenue to 276 in 2019 as compared to 279 in 2018 our other salaries and wages as a percent of revenue also improved to 102 in 2019 as compared to 105 in 2018

employee benefit costs increased 455 million or 87 in 2019 as compared to 2018 due primarily to increased expense associated with phantom stock plan retirement benefits historically linked to the market price of our common stock as well as additional expense associated with the december 2019 amendments to the phantom stock plans employee benefits were also impacted by higher group health and dental costs resulting from an increase in the number of employees and their family members covered by our plans as a result of these increases our benefit costs as a percent of salaries and wages increased to 364 in 2019 compared to 335 in 2018

operating supplies and expenses decreased 244 million or 49 in 2019 as compared to 2018 due primarily to a decrease in our costs for fuel used in our vehicles our diesel fuel costs excluding fuel taxes represents the largest component of operating supplies and expenses and can vary based on both average price per gallon and consumption the decrease in our diesel fuel costs excluding fuel taxes was due primarily to an 80 decrease in our average cost per gallon of diesel fuel during 2019 in addition our gallons consumed decreased 41 in 2019 as compared to 2018 due primarily to a 31 decrease in linehaul and pd miles driven we do not use diesel fuel hedging instruments therefore our costs are subject to market price fluctuations other operating supplies and expenses increased slightly as a percent of revenue between the periods compared 

depreciation and amortization increased 233 million or 101 in 2019 as compared to 2018 due primarily to the assets acquired as part of our 2018 and 2019 capital expenditure programs these costs increased as a percent of revenue in 2019 due to the loss of leverage associated with the decrease in volumes and a capital expenditure plan for equipment that anticipated more business growth while our 2020 capital expenditure plan is lower than 2019 particularly with respect to tractors and trailers we believe depreciation expense will continue to increase while our investments in real estate equipment and technology can increase our costs in the shortterm we believe these investments are necessary to support our continued longterm growth and strategic initiatives

our effective tax rate in 2019 was 253 as compared to 257 in 2018 our effective tax rate generally exceeds the federal statutory rate due to the impact of state taxes and to a lesser extent certain other nondeductible items

 

201 8 compared to 201 7 

key financial and operating metrics for 2018 and 2017 are presented below

 



 

1  intercity mile statistics have been adjusted to exclude miles related to nonltl shipments 

 

revenue

revenue increased 6856 million or 204 as compared to 2017 due to a 6791 million increase in ltl revenue and a 65 million increase in nonltl revenue ltl revenue was higher in 2018 due to increases in both ltl tons and yield the 101 increase in ltl tons during 2018 resulted from a 94 increase in ltl shipments and a 06 increase in ltl weight per shipment as compared to 2017 we believe these increases were driven by a stronger us domestic economy and market share gains resulting from increased demand for the consistent levels of superior service that we provide to our customers

ltl revenue per hundredweight increased 96 to 2125 in 2018 as compared to 2017 we believe the continued increase in our revenue per hundredweight reflected our consistent yield management process and a favorable pricing environment that resulted from general capacity constraints in the transportation industry our ltl revenue and yield were also positively impacted by an increase in fuel surcharges in 2018 as compared to 2017 excluding fuel surcharges ltl revenue per hundredweight increased 69 in 2018 compared to 2017 as a percent of revenue fuel surcharges increased to 133 in 2018 from 111 in 2017 

operating costs and other expenses

salaries wages and benefits increased 2732 million or 152 in 2018 due to a 2016 million increase in salaries and wages and a 716 million increase in benefit costs the increase in the costs attributable to salaries and wages was due primarily to an increase in the number of fulltime employees and increases in our employees’ wages our average number of fulltime employees increased 142 during 2018 as compared to 2017 to support our shipment growth salaries and wages also increased as a result of higher performancebased compensation and annual wage increases provided to our employees at the beginning of both september 2018 and september 2017 in addition our costs were also impacted by productivity declines in our platform and pd operations related to training of our new employees although our costs increased our aggregate productive labor costs as a percent of revenue improved to 279 in 2018 compared to 293 in 2017 our indirect salaries and wages as a percent of revenue also improved to 115 in 2018 compared to 120 in 2017

 

employee benefit costs increased 716 million or 159 due primarily to the increase in our average number of fulltime employees enhancements to our employees’ paid time off benefits implemented in 2018 and higher 401k benefits directly linked to the increase in our net income the change in our benefit costs was also impacted by a decrease in the costs of certain retirement benefits directly linked to the market price of our common stock and lower workers’ compensation cost per employee in 2018 as compared to 2017 as a percent of salaries and wages our benefit costs increased to 335 in 2018 compared to 332 in 2017

operating supplies and expenses increased 1092 million or 286 in 2018 as compared to 2017 due primarily to increased costs of diesel fuel the cost of diesel fuel excluding fuel taxes represents the largest component of operating supplies and expenses and can vary based on both average price per gallon and consumption the increase in our diesel fuel costs excluding fuel taxes was due primarily to a 249 increase in our average cost per gallon of diesel fuel during 2018 in addition our gallons consumed increased 108 in 2018 as compared to 2017 due primarily to an 111 increase in linehaul and pd miles driven we do not use diesel fuel hedging instruments therefore our costs are subject to market price fluctuations

 

depreciation and amortization increased 246 million or 120 due primarily to the assets acquired as part of our 2017 and 2018 capital expenditure programs while our investments in real estate equipment and technology can increase our costs in the shortterm we believe these investments are necessary to support our continued longterm growth and strategic initiatives 

our effective tax rate in 2018 was 257 as compared to 195 in 2017 our provision for income taxes in 2017 included a 1049 million income tax benefit resulting from the revaluation of our deferred tax liabilities in connection with the passage of the tax act in december 2017 the tax act also lowered the federal statutory rate to 21 from 35 beginning in 2018 our effective tax rate generally exceeds the federal statutory rate due to the impact of state taxes and to a lesser extent certain other nondeductible items

liquidity and capital resources

a summary of our cash flows is presented below

 



 

the change in our cash flows provided by operating activities during 2019 as compared to 2018 was impacted by an increase in depreciation and amortization of 233 million a decrease in our income taxes paid of 127 million and fluctuations in other working capital accounts

the change in our cash flows provided by operating activities during 2018 as compared to 2017 was impacted by an increase in income before income taxes of 2397 million an increase in depreciation and amortization of 246 million a decrease in income taxes paid of 294 million and fluctuations in certain working capital accounts

the changes in cash flows used in investing activities for all periods were primarily due to the increased land and structure expenditures to increase the capacity of our service center network and changes to our revenue equipment expenditures associated with our fleet replacement cycle and anticipated volume trends each year changes in our capital expenditures are more fully described below in “capital expenditures”

the changes in cash flows used in financing activities for all periods were due primarily to fluctuations in capital returned to shareholders and fluctuations in our longterm debt which includes our senior unsecured revolving line of credit our financing arrangements are more fully described below under “financing agreements” our return of capital to shareholders is more fully described below under “stock repurchase program” and “dividends to shareholders”

we have three primary sources of available liquidity cash and cash equivalents cash flows from operations and available borrowings under our senior unsecured revolving credit agreement which is described below we believe we also have sufficient access to debt and equity markets to provide other sources of liquidity if needed

capital expenditures

the table below sets forth our net capital expenditures for property and equipment including those obtained through capital leases for the years ended december 31 2019 2018 and 2017

 



 

 

our capital expenditures varied based upon the projected increase in the number and size of our service center facilities to support our plan for longterm growth our planned tractor and trailer replacement cycle and forecasted tonnage and shipment growth expenditures for land and structures can be dependent upon the availability of land in the geographic areas where we are looking to expand we expect to continue to maintain a high level of capital expenditures in order to support our longterm plan for market share growth 

we currently estimate capital expenditures will be approximately 315 million for the year ending december 31 2020 approximately 245 million is allocated for the purchase of service center facilities construction of new service center facilities or expansion of existing service center facilities subject to the availability of suitable real estate and the timing of construction projects approximately 50 million is allocated for investments in technology and other assets and approximately 20 million is allocated for the purchase of tractors and trailers we expect to fund these capital expenditures primarily through cash flows from operations our existing cash and cash equivalents and the use of our senior unsecured revolving credit facility we believe our current sources of liquidity will be sufficient to satisfy our expected capital expenditures

stock repurchase program

during the second quarter of 2019 we completed our stock repurchase program previously announced on may 17 2018 to repurchase up to an aggregate of 2500 million of our outstanding common stock on may 16 2019 we announced that our board of directors had approved a new twoyear stock repurchase program authorizing us to repurchase up to an aggregate of 3500 million of our outstanding common stock the “2019 repurchase program” under the 2019 repurchase program which became effective upon the expiration of our prior stock repurchase program we may repurchase shares from time to time in open market purchases or through privately negotiated transactions shares of our common stock repurchased under our repurchase programs are canceled at the time of repurchase and are classified as authorized but unissued shares of our common stock 

during the years ended december 31 2019 2018 and 2017 we repurchased 1602224 1175565 and 91921 shares of our common stock under our repurchase programs for an aggregate of 2410 million 1633 million and 80 million respectively as of december 31 2019 we had 2408 million remaining authorized under the 2019 repurchase program 

dividends to shareholders

 

our board of directors declared a cash dividend of 017 per share for each quarter of 2019 013 per share for each quarter of 2018 and 010 per share for each quarter of 2017

 

on february 6 2020 we announced that our board of directors had declared a cash dividend of 023 per share of our common stock the dividend is payable on march 18 2020 to shareholders of record at the close of business on march 4 2020 although we intend to pay a quarterly cash dividend on our common stock for the foreseeable future the declaration and amount of any future dividend is subject to approval by our board of directors and is restricted by applicable state law limitations on distributions to shareholders as well as certain covenants under our revolving credit facility we anticipate that any future quarterly cash dividends will be funded through cash flows from operations and if needed borrowings under our revolving credit facility 

 

on february 21 2020 we announced that our board of directors has approved a threefortwo split of our common stock for shareholders of record as of the close of business on the record date of march 10 2020 the additional shares will be distributed by our transfer agent broadridge corporate issuer solutions inc on march 24 2020 in lieu of fractional shares shareholders will receive a cash payment based on the average of the high and low sales prices of the common stock on the record date

financing agreements

we have one unsecured senior note agreement with a principal amount outstanding of 450 million at december 31 2019 and december 31 2018 the agreement calls for a scheduled principal payment of 450 million with an interest rate of 479 on january 3 2021

on november 21 2019 we entered into a second amended and restated credit agreement with wells fargo bank national association serving as administrative agent for the lenders the “credit agreement” the credit agreement provides for a fiveyear 2500 million senior unsecured revolving line of credit and a 1500 million accordion feature which if fully exercised and approved would expand the total borrowing capacity up to an aggregate of 4000 million of the 2500 million line of credit commitments under the credit agreement up to 1000 million may be used for letters of credit 

at our option borrowings under the credit agreement bear interest at either i libor including applicable successor provisions plus an applicable margin based on our ratio of net debttototal capitalization that ranges from 1000 to 1375 or ii a base rate plus an applicable margin based on our ratio of net debttototal capitalization that ranges from 0000 to 0375 letter of credit fees equal to the applicable margin for libor loans are charged quarterly in arrears on the daily average aggregate 

 

stated amount of all letters of credit outstanding during the quarter commitment fees ranging from 01 00  to 0 175  based upon the ratio of net debttototal capitalization are charged quarterly in arrears on the aggregate unutilized portion of the credit agreement 

for periods covered under the credit agreement the applicable margin on libor loans and letter of credit fees were 1000 and commitment fees were 0100

the credit agreement replaced our previous fiveyear 3000 million senior unsecured revolving credit agreement dated as of december 15 2015 as amended on september 9 2016 the “prior credit agreement” for periods in 2019 and 2018 covered under the prior credit agreement the applicable margin on libor loans and letter of credit fees were 1000 and commitment fees were 0125

the amounts outstanding and available borrowing capacity at december 31 2019 under the credit agreement and at december 31 2018 under the prior credit agreement are presented below

 



 

the interest rate is fixed on our senior note agreement therefore shortterm exposure to fluctuations in interest rates is limited to our line of credit facility we do not currently use interest rate derivative instruments to manage exposure to interest rate changes

our senior note agreement and credit agreement contain customary covenants including financial covenants that require us to observe a maximum ratio of debt to total capital and a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio any future whollyowned material domestic subsidiaries of the company would be required to guarantee payment of all of our obligations under these agreements the credit agreement also includes a provision limiting our ability to make restricted payments including dividends and payments for share repurchases unless among other conditions no defaults or events of default are ongoing or would be caused by such restricted payment we were in compliance with all covenants in our outstanding debt instruments for the period ended december 31 2019

a significant decrease in demand for our services could limit our ability to generate cash flow and affect our profitability our senior note agreement has covenants that require stated levels of financial performance which if not achieved could cause acceleration of the payment schedules as of december 31 2019 we were in compliance with these covenants we do not anticipate a significant decline in business levels or financial performance that would cause us to violate any such covenants in the future and we believe the combination of our existing credit agreement along with our additional borrowing capacity will be sufficient to meet foreseeable seasonal and longterm capital needs

contractual obligations

the following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations as of december 31 2019

 



 



 



 



 

critical accounting policies 

in preparing our financial statements we apply the following critical accounting policies that we believe affect our judgments and estimates of amounts recorded in certain assets liabilities revenue and expenses these critical accounting policies are further described in note 1 of the notes to the financial statements included in item 8 of this report

revenue recognition

our revenue is generated from providing transportation and related services to customers in accordance with the bill of lading “bol” contract our general tariff provisions and contractual agreements generally our performance obligations begin when we receive a bol from a customer and are satisfied when we complete the delivery of a shipment and related services we recognize revenue for our performance obligations under our customer contracts over time as our customers receive the benefits of our services in accordance with accounting standards update “asu” 201409 with respect to services not completed at the end of a reporting period we use a percentage of completion method to allocate the appropriate revenue to each separate reporting period under this method we develop a factor for each uncompleted shipment by dividing the actual number of days in transit at the end of a reporting period by that shipment’s standard delivery time schedule this factor is applied to the total revenue for that shipment and revenue is allocated between reporting periods accordingly payment terms vary by customer and are shortterm in nature

allowances for uncollectible accounts and revenue adjustments

we maintain an allowance for uncollectible accounts for estimated losses resulting from the failure of our customers to make required payments we estimate this allowance by analyzing the aging of our customer receivables our historical loss experience and other trends and factors affecting the credit risk of our customers including anticipated changes to future performance we determine customer receivables to be past due when payment has not been received by the invoice due date writeoffs occur when we determine an account to be uncollectible and could differ from our allowance estimate as a result of factors such as changes in the overall economic environment or risks surrounding our customers additional allowances may be required if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments we periodically review the underlying assumptions in our estimate of the allowance for uncollectible accounts to ensure that the allowance reflects the most recent trends and factors

we also maintain an allowance for estimated revenue adjustments resulting from future billing corrections customer allowances moneyback service guarantees and other miscellaneous revenue adjustments these revenue adjustments are recorded in our revenue from operations we use historical experience trends and current information to update and evaluate these estimates

claims and insurance accruals

claims and insurance accruals reflect the estimated cost of claims for cargo loss and damage bipd workers’ compensation group health and dental the related costs are charged to insurance and claims expense except for workers’ compensation group health and dental which are charged to employee benefits expense

insurers providing excess coverage above a company’s sir or deductible levels typically adjust their premiums to cover insured losses and for other market factors as a result we periodically evaluate our sir and deductible levels to determine the most costefficient balance between our exposure and excess coverage

in establishing accruals for claims and expenses we evaluate and monitor each claim individually and we use factors such as historical claims development experience known trends and thirdparty estimates to determine the appropriate reserves for potential liability we believe the assumptions and methods used to estimate these liabilities are reasonable however any changes in the severity of previouslyreported claims significant changes in medical costs and regulatory changes affecting the administration of our plans could significantly impact the determination of appropriate reserves in future periods

property and equipment

property and equipment are recorded at cost and depreciated on a straightline basis over their estimated economic lives we use historical experience certain assumptions and estimates in determining the economic life of each asset when indicators of impairment exist we review property and equipment for impairment due to changes in operational and market conditions and we adjust the carrying value and economic life of any impaired asset as appropriate

estimated economic lives for structures are 7 to 30 years revenue equipment is 4 to 15 years other equipment is 2 to 20 years and leasehold improvements are the lesser of the economic life of the leasehold improvement or the remaining life of the lease the use of different assumptions estimates or significant changes in the resale market for our equipment could result in material changes in the carrying value and related depreciation of our assets

 

inflation 

most of our expenses are affected by inflation which typically results in increased operating costs in response to fluctuations in the cost of petroleum products particularly diesel fuel we generally include a fuel surcharge in our tariffs and contractual agreements the fuel surcharge is designed to offset the cost of diesel fuel above a base price and fluctuates as diesel fuel prices change from the base which is generally indexed to the doe’s published fuel prices that reset each week volatility in the price of diesel fuel independent of inflation has impacted our business as described in this report however we do not believe inflation has had a material effect on our results of operations for any of the past three years

related party transactions

family relationships

each of earl e congdon david s congdon and john r congdon jr are related to one another and served in various management positions andor on our board of directors during 2019 our employment agreement with david s congdon is incorporated by reference as an exhibit to this annual report on form 10k we regularly disclose the amount of compensation that we pay to these individuals as well as the compensation paid to any of their family members employed by us that from time to time may require disclosure in the proxy statement for our annual meeting of shareholders

audit committee approval

the audit committee of our board of directors reviews and approves all related person transactions in accordance with our related person transactions policy




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk

market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact our financial position results of operations and cash flows due to adverse changes in financial market prices and rates

we are exposed to interest rate risk directly related to loans if any under our credit agreement which have variable interest rates a 100 basis point increase in the average interest rate on this agreement would have no material effect on our operating results we have established policies and procedures to manage exposure to market risks and use major institutions that we believe are creditworthy to minimize credit risk

we are exposed to market risk for investments relating to companyowned life insurance contracts on certain current and former employees the cash surrender value for variable life insurance contracts was 567 million of the 590 million and 457 million of the 477 million of aggregate cash surrender values for all life insurance contracts included on our balance sheets at december 31 2019 and 2018 respectively the underlying investments in our variable life insurance contracts expose us to market fluctuations to provide a meaningful assessment of the market risk for investments relating to companyowned life insurance contracts we performed a sensitivity analysis using a 10 change in market value in those investments on december 31 2019 a 10 change in market value would have caused a 57 million and a 46 million impact on our pretax income in 2019 and 2018 respectively

we are also exposed to commodity price risk related to diesel fuel prices and we manage our exposure to that risk primarily through the application of fuel surcharges to our customers

for further discussion related to these risks see notes 2 and 8 of the notes to the financial statements included in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” and item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations”

overview

we are a leading lessthantruckload “ltl” unionfree motor carrier providing regional interregional and national ltl services through a single integrated organization our service offerings which include expedited transportation are provided through an expansive network of service centers located throughout the continental united states through strategic alliances we also provide ltl services throughout north america in addition to our core ltl services we offer a range of valueadded services including container drayage truckload brokerage and supply chain consulting more than 97 of our revenue has historically been derived from transporting ltl shipments for our customers whose demand for our services is generally tied to industrial production and the overall health of the us domestic economy

we are the fourth largest ltl motor carrier in the united states as measured by 2017 revenue according to transport topics  we have increased our revenue and customer base over the past five years primarily through organic market share growth our infrastructure allows us to provide nextday and secondday service through each of our regions covering the continental united states we opened 14 and 29 new service centers over the past five and ten years respectively for a total of 235 service centers at december 31 2018 we believe this expansion produced increased capacity within our service center network and provides us with opportunities for future growth

we believe the growth in demand for our services can be attributed to our ability to consistently provide a superior level of customer service at a fair price which allows our customers to meet their supply chain needs our integrated structure allows us to offer our customers consistent highquality service from origin to destination and we believe our operating structure and proprietary information systems enable us to efficiently manage our operating costs our services are complemented by our technological capabilities which we believe provide the tools to improve the efficiency of our operations while also empowering our customers to manage their individual shipping needs

we were founded in 1934 and incorporated in virginia in 1950 our principal executive offices are located at 500 old dominion way thomasville north carolina 27360

our industry

trucking companies provide transportation services to virtually every industry operating in the united states and generally offer higher levels of reliability and faster transit times than other surface transportation options the trucking industry is comprised principally of two types of motor carriers ltl and truckload ltl freight carriers typically pick up multiple shipments from multiple customers on a single truck the ltl freight is then routed through a network of service centers where the freight may be transferred to other trucks with similar destinations ltl motor carriers generally require a more expansive network of local pickup and delivery “pd” service centers as well as larger breakbulk or hub facilities in contrast truckload carriers generally dedicate an entire truck to one customer from origin to destination

 

significant capital is required to create and maintain a network of service centers and a fleet of tractors and trailers the high fixed costs and capital spending requirements for ltl motor carriers make it difficult for new startup or small operators to effectively compete wi th established carriers in addition successful ltl motor carriers generally employ and regularly update a high level of technologybased systems and processes that provide information to customers and help reduce operating costs 

according to the american trucking associations the trucking industry accounted for 793 of the 8834 billion total us transportation revenue in 2017 the ltl sector had revenue in 2017 of 556 billion which represented 63 of total us transportation revenue the ltl industry is highly competitive on the basis of service and price and has consolidated significantly since the industry was deregulated in 1980 based on 2017 revenue as reported in transport topics  the largest 10 and 25 ltl motor carriers accounted for approximately 55 and 67 respectively of the total ltl market we believe consolidation in our industry will continue due to customer demand for transportation providers offering both national and regional ltl as well as other complementary valueadded services

competition

the transportation and logistics industry is intensely competitive and highly fragmented we compete with regional interregional and national ltl carriers and to a lesser extent with truckload carriers small package carriers airfreight carriers and railroads we also compete with and provide transportation services to thirdparty logistics providers that determine both the mode of transportation and the carrier some of our competitors may have a broader global network and a wider range of services than we do competition in our industry is based primarily on service price available capacity and business relationships we believe we are able to gain market share by expanding our capacity and providing highquality service at a fair price

throughout our organization we continuously seek to improve customer service by maximizing ontime performance and minimizing cargo claims we believe our transit times are generally faster and more reliable than those of our principal national competitors in part because of our more efficient service center network use of team drivers and proprietary technology in addition we provide greater geographic coverage than most of our regional competitors our diversified mix and scope of regional interregional and national ltl service combined with our valueadded service offerings enables us to provide our customers with a single source to meet their shipping and logistics needs we believe the combination of these factors provides us with a distinct advantage over most of our competitors

we utilize flexible scheduling and train our employees to perform multiple tasks which we believe allows us to achieve greater productivity and higher levels of customer service than our competitors we believe our focus on employee communication continued education development and motivation strengthens the relationships and trust among our employees

service center operations

at december 31 2018 we operated 235 service center locations of which we owned 203 and leased 32 our network includes ten major breakbulk facilities located in rialto california atlanta georgia columbus ohio indianapolis indiana greensboro north carolina harrisburg pennsylvania memphis and morristown tennessee dallas texas and salt lake city utah while using various other service centers for additional limited breakbulk activity in order to serve our nextday markets our service centers are strategically located throughout the country so that we can provide the highest quality service and minimize freight rehandling costs

our service centers are responsible for the pickup and delivery of freight within their local service area each night our service centers load outbound freight for transport to our other service centers for delivery all inbound freight received by the service center in the evening or during the night is generally scheduled for local delivery the next business day unless a customer requests a different delivery schedule our management reviews the productivity and service performance of each service center on a daily basis to ensure quality service and efficient operations

although we have established primary responsibility for customer service at the local service center level our customers may access information and initiate transactions through our centralized customer service department located at our corporate office or through other electronic gateways our systems allow us to offer our customers access to information such as freight tracking shipping documents rate quotes rate databases and account activity these centralized systems and our customer service department provide our customers with a single point of contact to access information across all areas of our operations and for each of our service offerings

linehaul transportation

linehaul dispatchers control the movement of freight between service centers through integrated freight movement systems we also utilize loadplanning software to optimize efficiencies in our linehaul operations our management team monitors freight movements transit times load factors and many other productivity measurements to help ensure that we maintain our high levels of service and efficiency

 

we utilize scheduled routes and additional li nehaul dispatches as necessary to meet our published transit times in addition we gain efficiency through the use of twin 28foot trailers in our linehaul operations the use of twin 28foot trailers permits us to transport freight directly from its poin t of origin to destination with minimal unloading and reloading which also reduces cargo loss and damage expenses we utilize longcombination vehicles such as triple 28foot trailers and combinations of 48foot and 28foot trailers in states where perm itted twin trailers and longcombination vehicles permit more freight to be transported behind a tractor than could otherwise be transported by one trailer 

tractors trailers and maintenance

at december 31 2018 we owned 9254 tractors we generally use new tractors in linehaul operations for approximately three to five years and then transfer those tractors to pd operations for the remainder of their useful lives in many of our service centers tractors perform pd functions during the day and linehaul functions at night to maximize tractor utilization

the table below reflects as of december 31 2018 the average age of our tractors and trailers

 



 

we develop certain specifications for tractors and trailers and then negotiate the production and purchase of this equipment with several manufacturers these purchases are planned well in advance of anticipated delivery dates in order to accommodate manufacturers’ production schedules we believe there is sufficient capacity among suppliers to ensure an uninterrupted supply of equipment to support our operations

the table below sets forth our capital expenditures for tractors and trailers for the years ended december 31 2018 2017 and 2016 for more information concerning our capital expenditures see item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations – liquidity and capital resources” in this report

 



 

at december 31 2018 we operated 39 maintenance centers at strategic service center locations throughout our network these maintenance centers are equipped to perform routine and preventive maintenance and repairs on our equipment

we adhere to established maintenance policies and procedures to help ensure our fleet is properly maintained tractors are routed to appropriate maintenance facilities at designated mileage intervals or every 90 days whichever occurs first trailers are also scheduled for preventative maintenance every 90 days

customers

revenue is generated primarily from customers throughout the united states and north america in 2018 our largest customer accounted for approximately 40 of our revenue and our largest 5 10 and 20 customers accounted for 137 193 and 260 of our revenue respectively for each of our last three fiscal years more than 95 of our revenue was derived from services performed in the united states and less than 5 of our revenue was generated from services performed internationally we believe the diversity of our customer base helps protect our business from adverse developments in a single geographic region and from the reduction or loss of business from a single customer

we utilize an integrated freightcosting system to determine the price level at which a particular shipment of freight will be profitable we can modify elements of this freightcosting model to simulate the actual conditions under which the freight will be moved many of our customers engage our services through the terms and provisions of our tariffs and through negotiated service contracts we also compete for business by participating in bid solicitations customers generally solicit bids for relatively large numbers of shipments for a period of one to two years and typically choose to enter into contractual arrangements with a limited number of motor carriers based upon price and service

 

seasonality 

our tonnage levels and revenue mix are subject to seasonal trends common in our industry although other factors such as macroeconomic changes could cause variation in these trends our revenue and operating margins in the first and fourth quarters are typically lower than those during the second and third quarters due to reduced shipments during the winter months harsh winter weather or natural disasters such as hurricanes tornadoes floods fires and other storms can also adversely impact our performance by reducing demand and increasing operating expenses we believe seasonal trends will continue to impact our business

technology

our technology is critical to the success and delivery of the premium service provided by our operations we continually seek to upgrade and enhance our technological capabilities we also provide access to our systems through multiple gateways that offer our customers and employees maximum flexibility and access to information we employ vehicle safety systems onboard and handheld computer systems freight handling systems and logistics technology to reduce costs and transit times as well as to meet regulatory requirements our data systems are integrated at every level within our organization which we believe is critical to our success our systems are protected through physical and software safeguards as well as redundant systems network security measures and backup systems we continue to focus on the development and enhancement of the technology used in our operations in order to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of our services

insurance

we carry a significant amount of insurance with thirdparty insurance carriers but we are exposed to the risk of loss on claims up to the limit for which we hold either a selfinsured retention “sir” or deductible at december 31 2018 we maintained a sir or deductible of 10 million or more with respect to the below casualty and group health coverages







we believe that our policy of maintaining a sir or deductible for a portion of our risks supported by our safety claims management and loss prevention programs is an effective means of managing insurance costs we periodically review our risk exposure and insurance coverage applicable to those risks and we believe that we maintain sufficient insurance coverage

diesel fuel availability and cost

we depend heavily upon the availability and quality of diesel fuel to provide our transportation services we maintain fuel storage and pumping facilities at certain service center locations as the primary source for fueling our fleet and we utilize overtheroad fueling options at retail locations as necessary we could be susceptible to regional andor national fuel shortages which could cause us to incur additional expense in order to obtain an adequate supply within our own fueling network or cause us to rely more heavily on higherpriced retail fuel

we believe our operations and financial condition are susceptible to the same diesel fuel price increases or shortages as those of our competitors we implemented a fuel surcharge program in august 1999 which has remained in effect since that time and is one of many components that we use to determine the overall price for our transportation services our fuel surcharges are generally indexed to fuel prices published by the us department of energy the “doe” that reset each week

employees

as of december 31 2018 we employed 21279 individuals on a fulltime basis none of which were represented under a collective bargaining agreement our fulltime employees work in the following roles

 



 

 

as of december 31 2018 we employed 5743 linehaul drivers and 5464 pd drivers on a fulltime basis we select our drivers primarily based upon safe driving records and experience among other requirements our drivers must pass a drug test have a current us department of transportation “dot” physical and have a valid commercial driver’s license prior to employment once employed drivers are required to obtain and maintain hazardous materials endorsements to their commercial driver’s licenses drivers like all of our employees are required to take preemployment drug and alcohol tests and are randomly selected for periodic additional testing

since 1988 we have provided the opportunity for qualified employees to become drivers through the “old dominion driver training program” there are currently 3273 active drivers who have successfully completed this training which was approximately 292 of our driver workforce as of december 31 2018 we believe our driver training and qualification programs have been important factors in improving our safety record and retaining qualified drivers in addition we have experienced an annual turnover rate for our driver graduates of approximately 57 which is below our companywide turnover rate for all drivers of approximately 80

we reward our drivers who maintain safe driving records with annual bonuses of up to 3000 per driver our safety bonuses paid to drivers totaled 41 million 39 million and 37 million in 2018 2017 and 2016 respectively

governmental regulation

we are regulated by the dot and by various state and federal agencies these regulatory authorities have broad powers over matters relating to authorized motor carrier operations as well as motor carrier registration driver hours of service safety and fitness of transportation equipment and drivers transportation of hazardous materials certain mergers and acquisitions and periodic financial reporting the trucking industry is also subject to regulatory and legislative changes from a variety of other governmental authorities which address matters such as increasingly stringent environmental regulations occupational safety and health regulations limits on vehicle weight and size ergonomics port security and driver hours of service

in addition we are subject to compliance with cargosecurity and transportation regulations issued by the transportation security administration “tsa” and customs and border protection “cbp” within the us department of homeland security regulatory requirements and changes in regulatory requirements or guidance may affect our business or the economics of the industry by requiring changes in operating practices that could influence the demand for and increase the costs of providing transportation services

driver hours of service

the federal motor carrier safety administration the “fmcsa” rules provide that a truck driver may work no more than a maximum number of 60 hours within seven consecutive days and 70 hours within eight consecutive days fmcsa rules further impose a maximum work period of 14 hours no more than 11 hours of which may be driving time after first coming onduty following 10 consecutive hours of offduty time fmcsa rules also require that drivers take a 30minute break prior to working beyond eight hours 

electronic logging devices

in december 2015 the fmcsa issued a final rule mandating the use of electronic logging devices “elds” to automatically record drivers’ time for hours of service reporting generally carriers were required to comply with these new requirements by december 18 2017 we currently utilize eld rulecompliant automatic onboard recording devices “aobrds” in all of our companyowned vehicles and the aobrd data is integrated with our existing comprehensive fleet management and safety systems in order to maximize our ability to integrate aobrd data from vehicles purchased after december 18 2017 with these fleet management and safety systems we applied for a waiver from certain aspects of the eld rule by the fmcsa in january 2018 this waiver proved unnecessary and was withdrawn as the fmcsa was made aware of multiple motor carriers facing the same issues from technology providers when changing from an aobrd to an eld operating system the fmcsa issued responsive guidance that allowed aobrd operating systems to be installed and utilized on eld compliant hardware until december 16 2019 we are working with service providers to transition our fleet from our current aobrd operating system to a new eld hardware and software platform we expect the transition to be completed prior to december 2019

commercial driver’s license drug and alcohol clearinghouse

in december 2016 the fmcsa released a final rule establishing the commercial driver’s license drug and alcohol clearinghouse “dac” the dac is a database that will maintain records of drug and alcohol violations of commercial motor vehicle drivers the dac will require us to check prospective employees for drug and alcohol violations and all current driver employees must be checked at least annually the intent of the clearinghouse is to ensure that drivers cannot conceal drug and alcohol violations 

 

by changing jobs or locations compliance with this rule which provides for a threeyear implementation period is required by january 6 2020 

we are subject to future rulemaking by the fmcsa and other regulatory agencies which could be more stringent require additional changes to our operations increase our operating costs or otherwise adversely impact our results of operations

environmental regulation

we are subject to various federal state and local environmental laws and regulations that focus on among other things the emission and discharge of hazardous materials into the environment or their presence at our properties or in our vehicles fuel storage tanks transportation of certain materials and the discharge or retention of storm water under specific environmental laws we could also be held responsible for any costs relating to contamination at our past or present facilities and at thirdparty waste disposal sites as well as costs associated with cleanup of accidents involving our vehicles we do not believe that the cost of future compliance with current environmental laws or regulations will have a material adverse effect on our operations financial condition competitive position or capital expenditures for the remainder of 2019 or fiscal year 2020 however future changes to laws or regulations may adversely affect our operations and could result in unforeseen costs to our business

 item 1a risk factors

various factors exist that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those projected in any forwardlooking statement in addition to the factors discussed elsewhere in this report we believe the following are some of the important risks and uncertainties that could materially affect our business financial condition or results of operations

we operate in a highly competitive industry and our business will suffer if we are unable to adequately address potential downward pricing pressures and other factors that may adversely affect our operations and profitability

numerous competitive factors could impair our ability to maintain our current profitability these factors include but are not limited to the following



















 









if we are unable to effectively compete with other ltl carriers whether on the basis of price service or otherwise we may be unable to retain existing customers or attract new customers either of which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations furthermore continued merger and acquisition activity in transportation and logistics could result in stronger or new competitors which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations we may not be able to compete successfully in an increasingly consolidated ltl industry and cannot predict with certainty how industry consolidation will affect our competitors or us

if our employees were to unionize our operating costs would increase and our ability to compete would be impaired

none of our employees are currently represented under a collective bargaining agreement however from time to time there have been efforts to organize our employees at various service centers further congress or one or more states could approve legislation andor the national labor relations board could render decisions or implement rule changes that could significantly affect our business and our relationship with our employees including actions that could substantially liberalize the procedures for union organization in addition we can offer no assurance that the department of labor will not adopt new regulations or interpret existing regulations in a manner that would favor the agenda of unions or that our employees will not unionize in the future particularly if regulatory changes occur that facilitate unionization

the unionization of our employees could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations because











if we are unable to successfully execute our growth strategy and develop market and consistently deliver highquality services that meet customer expectations our business and future results of operations may suffer

our growth strategy includes increasing the volume of freight moving through our existing service center network selectively expanding our capacity and broadening the scope of our service offerings in connection with our growth strategy at various times we have expanded and upgraded service centers purchased additional equipment and increased our sales and marketing efforts and we expect to continue to do so our growth strategy exposes us to a number of risks including the following











 

we cannot ensure that we will overcome the risks associated with our growth strategy if we fail to overcome those risks we may not realize additional revenue or profits from our efforts we may incur additional expenses and as a result our financial position and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 

we may be unable to successfully consummate and integrate acquisitions as part of our growth strategy

growth through acquisitions historically has been a key component of our ltl growth strategy in the future we may seek to acquire other ltl carriers as well as other complementary businesses exploration of potential acquisitions requires significant attention from our management team in addition we expect to compete for acquisition opportunities with other companies some of which may have greater financial and other resources than we do we cannot ensure that we will have sufficient cash to consummate an acquisition or otherwise be able to obtain financing for an acquisition if we are unable to access sufficient funding for potential acquisitions we may not be able to complete transactions that we otherwise find advantageous

any subsequent acquisition will entail numerous risks including



















in addition we may have difficulty integrating any acquired business and its operations services and personnel into our existing operations and such integration may require a significant amount of time and effort by our management team to the extent we do not successfully avoid or overcome the risks or problems resulting from any acquisitions we undertake there could be a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations

our customers’ and suppliers’ businesses may be impacted by various economic factors such as recessions downturns in the economy global uncertainty and instability changes in us social political and regulatory conditions andor a disruption of financial markets which may decrease demand for our services or increase our costs

adverse economic conditions both in the us and internationally can negatively affect our customers’ business levels the amount of transportation services they need their ability to pay for our services and overall freight levels any of which might impair our asset utilization additionally uncertainty and instability in the global economy and any other action that the us government may take to withdraw from or materially modify international trade arrangements including related to the united statesmexicocanada agreement which was agreed upon on september 30 2018 and is designed to replace the north american free trade agreement may lead to fewer goods being transported and could have a material adverse effect on our business financial conditions and results of operations the us government has made significant changes in us trade policy and has taken certain other actions that may impact us trade including imposing tariffs on certain goods imported into the united states to date several governments including the european union china and india have imposed tariffs on certain goods imported from the united states any further changes in us or international trade policy could trigger additional retaliatory actions by affected countries resulting in “trade wars” and increased costs for goods transported globally which may reduce customer demand for these products if the parties having to pay those tariffs increase their prices or in trading partners limiting their trade with countries that impose antitrade measures if these consequences are realized the volume of global economic activity may be significantly reduced such a reduction could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

customers adversely impacted by changes in us trade policies or otherwise encountering adverse economic conditions may be unable to obtain additional financing or financing under acceptable terms these customers represent a greater potential for bad debt losses which may require us to increase our reserve for bad debt economic conditions resulting in bankruptcies of one or more of our large customers could have a significant impact on our financial position results of operations or liquidity in a particular year or 

 

quarter further when adverse econom ic times arise customers may select competitors that offer lower rates in an attempt to lower their costs and we might be forced to lower our rates or lose freight volumes 

our suppliers’ business levels also may be negatively affected by adverse economic conditions and changes in the political and regulatory environment both in the us and internationally or financial constraints which could lead to disruptions in the supply and availability of equipment parts and services critical to our operations a significant interruption in our normal supply chain could disrupt our operations increase our costs and negatively impact our ability to serve our customers

we are also subject to cost increases outside of our control that could materially reduce our profitability if we are unable to increase our rates sufficiently such cost increases include but are not limited to increases in wage rates fuel prices interest rates taxes tolls license and registration fees insurance revenue equipment and healthcare for our employees

difficulties attracting and retaining qualified drivers and maintenance technicians could result in increases in driver and technician compensation and could adversely affect our profitability our ability to maintain or grow our fleet and our ability to maintain our customer relationships

from time to time we have experienced difficulty in attracting and retaining sufficient numbers of qualified drivers and such shortages may recur in the future due in part to the time commitment physical requirements our stringent hiring standards and current industry conditions the available pool of qualified employee drivers has been declining because of the intense competition for drivers we may face difficulty maintaining or increasing our number of drivers similarly in recent years there has been a decrease in the overall supply of skilled maintenance technicians particularly new technicians with qualifications from technical programs and schools which could make it more difficult to attract and retain skilled technicians the compensation we offer our drivers and technicians is subject to market conditions that may require increases in driver or technician compensation if we are unable to attract and retain a sufficient number of qualified drivers and technicians we could be required to adjust our compensation packages amend our hiring standards or operate with fewer trucks and face difficulty meeting customer demands any of which could adversely affect our growth and profitability

the fmcsa’s csa initiative could adversely impact our ability to hire qualified drivers meet our growth projections and maintain our customer relationships each of which could adversely impact our results of operations

the fmcsa’s compliance safety accountability initiative “csa” is an enforcement and compliance program designed to monitor and improve commercial motor vehicle safety by measuring the safety record of both the motor carrier and the driver these measurements are scored and used by the fmcsa to identify potential safety risks and to direct enforcement action

our csa scores are dependent upon our safety and compliance experience which could change at any time in addition the safety standards prescribed in csa could change and our ability to maintain an acceptable score could be adversely impacted public disclosure of certain csa scores was restricted through the enactment of the fixing america’s surface transportation act of 2015 the “fast act” on december 4 2015 however the fast act does not restrict public disclosure of all data collected by the fmcsa if we receive unacceptable csa scores and this data is made available to the public our relationships with our customers could be damaged which could result in a loss of business

the requirements of the csa could also shrink the industry’s pool of drivers as those with unfavorable scores could leave the industry as a result the costs to attract train and retain qualified drivers could increase in addition a shortage of qualified drivers could increase driver turnover decrease asset utilization limit growth and adversely impact our results of operations

we operate in a highly regulated industry and increased costs of compliance with or liability for violation of existing or future regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business

we are regulated by the dot and by various state and federal agencies these regulatory authorities have broad powers over matters relating to authorized motor carrier operations as well as motor carrier registration driver hours of service safety and fitness of transportation equipment and drivers transportation of hazardous materials certain mergers and acquisitions and periodic financial reporting the trucking industry is also subject to regulatory and legislative changes from a variety of other governmental authorities which address matters such as increasingly stringent environmental regulations occupational safety and health regulations limits on vehicle weight and size ergonomics port security and driver hours of service we are also subject to the costs and potential adverse impact of compliance associated with fmcsa’s eld regulations and guidance including the transition of our fleet and safety management systems from our legacy electronic aobrds to a new eld hardware and software platform in addition we are subject to compliance with cargosecurity and transportation regulations issued by the tsa and cbp within the us department of homeland security regulatory requirements and changes in regulatory requirements or guidance together with the growing compliance risks presented by increased differences between applicable federal and state regulations may affect our business or the economics of the industry by requiring changes in operating practices that could influence the demand for and increase the costs of providing transportation services

 

insurance and claims expenses could significantly reduce our profitability 

we are exposed to claims related to cargo loss and damage property damage personal injury workers’ compensation group health and group dental we have insurance coverage with thirdparty insurance carriers but we assume a significant portion of the risk associated with these claims due to our sirs and deductibles our operating results could be adversely affected if any of the following were to occur i the number or the severity of claims increases ii we are required to accrue or pay additional amounts because claims prove to be more severe than our original assessment or iii claims exceed our coverage amounts if claims exceed our sir or deductible levels insurance companies exit the transportation insurance marketplace or insurance market conditions change insurers could raise premiums for excess coverage to cover their expenses and anticipated future losses in addition insurance companies generally require us to collateralize our sir or deductible levels if these collateralization requirements increase our borrowing capacity could be adversely affected

healthcare legislation may increase our costs and reduce our future profitability

to attract and retain employees we maintain a competitive health insurance plan for our employees and their dependents we cannot predict the impact that any state or federal healthcare legislation or regulation will have on our operations but we expect costs associated with providing benefits under employee medical plans and healthcarerelated costs associated with workers’ compensation to continue to increase rising healthcare costs in the us could result in significant longterm costs to us which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results in addition rising healthcare costs could force us to make further changes to our benefits program which could negatively impact our ability to attract and retain employees

we have significant ongoing cash requirements that could limit our growth and affect our profitability if we are unable to obtain sufficient capital

our business is highly capital intensive we generally finance our capital expenditures and planned growth with existing cash cash flow from operations issuance of debt and through available borrowings under our existing senior unsecured credit agreement we may require additional capital to finance longterm real estate purchase opportunities and acquisitions which we may fund through additional debt or through equity offerings if we are unable to generate sufficient cash from our operations or raise capital by accessing the debt and equity markets we may be forced to limit our growth and operate our equipment for longer periods of time which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results

our business also has significant ongoing operating cash requirements if our cash requirements are high or our cash flow from operations is low during particular periods we may need to seek additional financing which could be costly or difficult to obtain

limited supply and increased costs of new equipment may adversely affect our earnings and cash flow

we may face difficulty in purchasing new equipment due to decreased supply and increased costs investment in new equipment is a significant part of our annual capital expenditures and we require an available supply of tractors and trailers from equipment manufacturers to operate and grow our business we may also be subject to shortages in raw materials that are required for the production of critical operating equipment and supplies such as shortages in rubber or steel

the price of our equipment may also be adversely affected in the future by regulations on newly manufactured tractors and diesel engines we are subject to regulations issued by the us environmental protection agency the “epa” and various state agencies particularly the california air resources board “carb” that have required progressive reductions in exhaust emissions from diesel engines we may become subject to new or more restrictive regulations or differing interpretations of existing regulations which may increase the cost of providing transportation services or adversely affect our results of operations we are also unable to predict how any future changes in us government policy will affect epa and carb regulation and enforcement these regulations have resulted in higher prices for tractors and diesel engines and increased operating and maintenance costs and there can be no assurance that continued increases in pricing or costs will not have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations

we may be adversely impacted by fluctuations in the availability and price of diesel fuel

diesel fuel is a critical component of our operations and a significant operating expense for our business future fluctuations in prices and diesel fuel availability could have a material adverse effect on our operating results diesel fuel prices and fuel availability can be impacted by factors beyond our control such as natural or manmade disasters adverse weather conditions political events disruption or failure of technology or information systems price and supply decisions by oil producing countries and cartels terrorist activities armed conflict world supply and demand imbalances tariffs sanctions and quotas or other changes to trade agreements we maintain fuel storage and pumping facilities at many of our service center locations however we may be susceptible to fuel shortages at certain locations that could cause us to incur additional expense to ensure adequate supply on a timely basis and to prevent a disruption to our service schedules an interruption in the supply of diesel fuel could have a material adverse effect on our operating results 

 

we do not hedge against the risk of diesel fuel price increases an increase in diesel fuel prices or diesel fuel taxes or any change in federal or state regulations that results in such an increase could have a material adverse effect on our operating results we have fuel surcharge progr ams in place with a majority of our customers which help offset the negative impact of the increased cost of diesel fuel and other petroleumbased products however we also incur fuel costs that cannot be recovered even with respect to customers with whi ch we maintain fuel surcharge programs such as those costs associated with empty miles or the time during which our engines are idling because our fuel surcharge recovery lags behind changes in fuel prices our fuel surcharge recovery may not capture the increased costs we pay for fuel especially when prices are rising leading to fluctuations in our levels of reimbursement we regularly monitor the components of our pricing including fuel surcharges and address individual account profitability issues with our customers when necessary however there can be no assurance that fuel surcharges can be maintained indefinitely or will be sufficiently effective in offsetting increases in diesel fuel prices 

we are subject to various governmental laws and regulations and costs of compliance with liabilities under or violations of existing or future governmental laws or regulations could adversely affect our business

we are subject to various federal state and local governmental laws and regulations that govern among other things the emission and discharge of hazardous materials into the environment the presence of hazardous materials at our properties or in our vehicles fuel storage tanks the transportation of certain materials and the discharge or retention of storm water under certain environmental laws we could also be held responsible for any costs relating to contamination at our past or present facilities and at thirdparty waste disposal sites as well as costs associated with the cleanup of accidents involving our vehicles environmental laws have become and may continue to be increasingly more stringent over time and there can be no assurance that our costs of complying with current or future environmental laws or liabilities arising under such laws will not have a material adverse effect on our business operations or financial condition

in addition to epa and state agency regulations on exhaust emissions with which we must comply there is an increased legislative and regulatory focus on climate change greenhouse gas emissions and the impact of global warming state and local governments are increasingly considering greenhouse gas emissions regulation this possibility of increased regulation of greenhouse gas emissions potentially exposes us to significant new taxes fees and other costs we are also subject to increasing sensitivity to sustainability issues this increased focus on sustainability may result in new regulations andor customer requirements that could adversely impact our business any future limitations on the emission of greenhouse gases other environmental legislation or customer sustainability requirements could increase our future capital expenditures and have an adverse impact on our financial condition results of operations and liquidity

we are subject to the risks of litigation and governmental proceedings or inquiries which could adversely affect our business

the nature of our business exposes us to the potential for various claims and litigation related to labor and employment personal injury property damage cargo claims safety and contract compliance environmental liability and other matters accordingly we are and in the future may be subject to legal proceedings and claims that have arisen in the ordinary course of our business and may include classaction allegations we are also subject to potential governmental proceedings inquiries and claims the parties in such actions may seek amounts from us that may not be covered in whole or in part by insurance defending ourselves against such actions could result in significant costs and could require a substantial amount of time and effort by our management team we cannot predict the outcome of litigation or governmental proceedings or inquiries to which we are a party or whether we will be subject to future legal actions as a result the potential costs associated with legal actions against us could adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations

we are subject to various risks arising from our international business operations and relationships which could adversely affect our business

we arrange for transportation and logistics services to and from various international locations and are subject to both the risks of conducting international business and the requirements of the foreign corrupt practices act of 1977 the “fcpa” failure to comply with the fcpa may result in legal claims against us in addition we face other risks associated with international operations and relationships which may include restrictive trade policies the renegotiation of international trade agreements imposition of duties taxes or government royalties imposed by foreign governments which could adversely affect our business

we are subject to legislative regulatory and legal developments involving taxes

taxes are a significant part of our expenses we are subject to us federal and state income payroll property sales and use fuel and other types of taxes the tax cuts and jobs act the “tax act” which was enacted on december 22 2017 includes a broad range of tax reform provisions affecting businesses including lower corporate tax rates changes in business deductions and international tax provisions changes to tax laws and regulations or changes to the interpretation thereof including regulations and interpretations pertaining to the tax act the ambiguity of tax laws and regulations the subjectivity of factual interpretations higher 

 

tax rates claims  audits investigations or legal proceedings involving taxing authorities could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

our results of operations may be affected by seasonal factors harsh weather conditions and disasters

our operations are subject to seasonal trends common in our industry our revenue and operating margins in the first and fourth quarters are typically lower than those during the second and third quarters due to reduced shipments during the winter months harsh winter weather or natural disasters such as hurricanes tornadoes floods fires and other storms can also adversely impact our performance by reducing demand and reducing our ability to transport freight which could result in decreased revenue and increased operating expenses

if we are unable to retain our key employees or if we do not continue to effectively execute our succession plan our financial condition results of operations and liquidity could be adversely affected

our success will continue to depend upon the experience and leadership of our key employees and executive officers in that regard the loss of the services of any of our key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and liquidity if we are unable to secure replacement personnel who have sufficient experience in our industry and in the management of our business if we are unable to continue to develop and retain a core group of management personnel and execute succession planning strategies or we encounter any unforeseen difficulties associated with the transition of members of our management team our business could be negatively impacted in the future

our principal shareholders control a large portion of our outstanding common stock

earl e congdon david s congdon john r congdon jr and their affiliate family members beneficially own an aggregate of approximately 19 of the outstanding shares of our common stock as long as the congdon family controls a large portion of our voting stock they may be able to significantly influence the election of the entire board of directors and the outcome of all matters involving a shareholder vote the congdon family’s interests may differ from the interests of other shareholders and the status of their ownership could change at their discretion

our financial results may be adversely impacted by potential future changes in accounting practices

future changes in accounting standards or practices and related legal and regulatory interpretations of those changes may adversely impact public companies in general the transportation industry or our operations specifically new accounting standards or requirements could change the way we record revenues expenses assets andor liabilities or could be costly to implement these types of regulations could have a negative impact on our financial position liquidity results of operations andor access to capital

our information technology systems are subject to cyber and other risks some of which are beyond our control which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial position

we rely heavily on the proper functioning and availability of our information systems for our operations as well as for providing valueadded services to our customers our information systems including our accounting communications and data processing systems are integral to the efficient operation of our business it is critical that the data processed by these systems remain confidential as it often includes competitive customer information confidential customer credit card and transaction data employee records and key financial and operational results and statistics the sophistication of efforts by hackers foreign governments cyberterrorists and cybercriminals acting individually or in coordinated groups to launch distributed denial of service attacks or other coordinated attacks that may cause service outages gain inappropriate or block legitimate access to systems or information or result in other business interruptions has continued to increase in recent years we utilize thirdparty service providers who have access to our systems and certain sensitive data which exposes us to additional security risks particularly given the complex and evolving laws and regulations regarding privacy and data protection while we and our thirdparty service providers have experienced cyberattacks and attempted breaches of our and their information technology systems and networks or similar events from time to time no such incidents have been individually or in the aggregate material to us cyber incidents that impact the security availability reliability speed accuracy or other proper functioning of our systems information and measures including outages computer viruses breakins and similar disruptions could have a significant impact on our operations 

although our information systems are protected through physical and software safeguards as well as redundant systems network security measures and backup systems it is difficult to fully protect against the possibility of power loss telecommunications failures cyber attacks and other cyber incidents in every potential circumstance that may arise a significant cyber incident including system failure security breach disruption by malware or ransomware or other damage could interrupt or delay our operations damage our reputation and brand cause a loss of customers expose us to a risk of loss or litigation result in regulatory scrutiny investigations actions fines or penalties andor cause us to incur significant time and expense to remedy such an event any of which could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial position furthermore any failure to comply with data 

 

privacy security or other laws and regulations could result in claims legal or regulatory proceedings inquiries or investigations as cyber threats are continuall y evolving our controls and procedures may become inadequate and we may be required to devote additional resources to modifying or enhancing our systems in the future furthermore while we maintain insurance intended to address costs associated with aspe cts of cyber incidents network failures and data privacyrelated concerns our coverage may not sufficiently cover all types of losses or claims that may arise 

failure to keep pace with developments in technology any disruption to our technology infrastructure or failures of essential services upon which our technology platforms rely could cause us to incur costs or result in a loss of business which may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition

we rely heavily on information technology systems our information technology systems are complex and require ongoing investments and enhancements to meet both internal requirements and the requirements of our customers if we are unable to invest in and enhance or modernize our technology systems in a timely manner or at a reasonable cost or if we are unable to train our employees to operate the new enhanced or modernized systems our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected we also may not achieve the benefits that we anticipate from any new technology or new or modernized system and a failure to do so could result in higher than anticipated costs or adversely affect our results of operations

our information technology systems also depend upon the internet thirdparty service providers global communications providers satellitebased communications systems the electric utilities grid electric utility providers and telecommunications providers we have minimal control over the operation quality or maintenance of these services or whether vendors will improve their services or continue to provide services that are essential to our business disruptions due to transitional challenges in upgrading or enhancing our technology systems failures in the services upon which our information technology platforms rely including those that may arise from adverse weather conditions or natural calamities such as floods hurricanes earthquakes or tornadoes illegal acts including terrorist attacks human error or systems modernization initiatives andor other disruptions may adversely affect our business which could increase our costs or result in a loss of customers that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position

damage to our reputation through unfavorable publicity could adversely affect our financial condition

in the current environment of instantaneous communication and social media outlets the quick and broad dissemination of information through media sources could cause damaging information about us whether accurate or not to be broadly publicized unfavorable publicity about us or our employees could damage our reputation and the value of the old dominion brand and may result in a reduction in demand for our services or the loss of customers our reputation could also be impacted by negative perceptions or publicity regarding esg issues or cybersecurity and data privacy concerns any unfavorable publicity and resulting erosion of trust and confidence could make it difficult for us to attract and retain customers and employees or require us to allocate significant resources to the rebuilding of our reputation and brand any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

antiterrorism measures and terrorist events may disrupt our business

federal state and municipal authorities have implemented and are continuing to implement various antiterrorism measures including checkpoints and travel restrictions on large trucks if additional security measures disrupt or impede the timing of our deliveries we may fail to meet the requirements of our customers or incur increased expenses to do so there can be no assurance that new antiterrorism measures will not be implemented and that such measures will not have a material adverse effect on our operations

a decrease in the demand and value of used equipment may impact our results of operations

as we purchase new tractors and trailers as part of our normal replacement cycle each year we rely on the used equipment market to dispose of our older equipment oversupply in the transportation industry as well as adverse domestic and foreign economic conditions can negatively impact the demand for used equipment and therefore reduce the value we can obtain on our used equipment if we are unable to sell our older equipment at or above our salvage value the resulting losses could have a significant impact on our results of operations

if we raise additional capital in the future your ownership in us could be diluted

any issuance of equity we may undertake in the future to raise additional capital could cause the price of our common stock to decline or require us to issue shares at a price that is lower than that paid by holders of our common stock in the past which would result in those newly issued shares being dilutive if we obtain funds through a credit facility or through the issuance of debt or preferred securities these obligations and securities would likely have rights senior to your rights as a common shareholder which could impair the value of our common stock

 

there can be no assurance of our ability to declare and pay cash dividends in future periods 

we intend to pay a quarterly cash dividend to holders of our common stock for the foreseeable future however dividend payments are subject to approval by our board of directors and are restricted by applicable state law limitations on distributions to shareholders as well as certain covenants under our revolving credit facility as a result future dividend payments are not guaranteed and will depend upon various factors such as our overall financial condition available liquidity anticipated cash needs future prospects for earnings and cash flows as well as other factors considered relevant by our board of directors in addition any reduction or suspension in our dividend payments could adversely affect the price of our common stock

the market value of our common stock has recently been and may in the future be volatile and could be substantially affected by various factors

the price of our common stock on the nasdaq global select market changes constantly we expect that the market price of our common stock will continue to fluctuate due to a variety of factors many of which are beyond our control these factors include among others























our common stock price may continue to fluctuate significantly in the future and these fluctuations may be unrelated to our performance general market price declines or market volatility in the future could adversely affect the price of our common stock and the current market price of our common stock may not be indicative of future market prices

our articles of incorporation our bylaws and virginia law contain provisions that could discourage delay or prevent a change in our control or our management

provisions of our articles of incorporation bylaws and the laws of virginia the state in which we are incorporated may discourage delay or prevent a change in control of us or a change in management that shareholders may consider favorable these provisions

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

overview

we are a leading lessthantruckload “ltl” unionfree motor carrier providing regional interregional and national ltl services through a single integrated organization our service offerings which include expedited transportation are provided through an expansive network of service centers located throughout the continental united states through strategic alliances we also provide ltl services throughout north america in addition to our core ltl services we offer a range of valueadded services including container drayage truckload brokerage and supply chain consulting more than 97 of our revenue has historically been derived from transporting ltl shipments for our customers whose demand for our services is generally tied to industrial production and the overall health of the us domestic economy

in analyzing the components of our revenue we monitor changes and trends in our ltl services using the following key metrics which exclude certain transportation and logistics services where pricing is generally not determined by weight commodity or distance



revenue per hundredweight is a commonlyused indicator of pricing trends but this metric can be influenced by many other factors such as changes in fuel surcharges weight per shipment length of haul and the class or mix of our freight as a result changes in revenue per hundredweight do not necessarily indicate actual changes in underlying base rates





our primary revenue focus is to increase density which is shipment and tonnage growth within our existing infrastructure increases in density allow us to maximize our asset utilization and labor productivity which we measure over many different functional areas of our operations including linehaul load factor pd stops per hour pd shipments per hour platform pounds handled per hour and platform shipments per hour in addition to our focus on density and operating efficiencies it is critical for us to obtain an appropriate yield which is measured as revenue per hundredweight on the shipments we handle we are committed to a disciplined yield management process that focuses on individual account profitability we believe yield management and improvements in efficiency are key components in our ability to produce profitable growth

our primary cost elements are direct wages and benefits associated with the movement of freight operating supplies and expenses which include diesel fuel and depreciation of our equipment fleet and service center facilities we gauge our overall success in managing costs by monitoring our operating ratio a measure of profitability calculated by dividing total operating expenses by revenue which also allows for industrywide comparisons with our competition

we continually upgrade our technological capabilities to improve our customer service and lower our operating costs our technology provides our customers with visibility of their shipments throughout our network increases the productivity of our workforce and provides key metrics that we use to monitor and enhance our processes

 

results o f operations 

the following table sets forth for the years indicated expenses and other items as a percentage of revenue from operations

 



our financial results for 2018 reflected company records in revenue and profitability as we exceeded 40 billion of annual revenue with an operating ratio below 800 we believe the increase in revenue during the year was driven by the continued strength of the domestic economy and consistent execution of our longterm strategy of providing industryleading service to our customers at a fair price these factors combined with the increase in freight density in our service center network and our continued focus on improving operating efficiency led to a 310 basispoint improvement in our operating ratio compared to 2017 as a result our net income and diluted earnings per share increased 306 and 311 respectively in 2018 as compared to 2017

2018 compared to 2017

key financial and operating metrics for 2018 and 2017 are presented below

 



 

revenue

revenue increased 6856 million or 204 as compared to 2017 due to a 6791 million increase in ltl revenue and a 65 million increase in nonltl revenue ltl revenue was higher in 2018 due to increases in both ltl tons and yield the 101 increase in ltl tons during 2018 resulted from a 94 increase in ltl shipments and a 06 increase in ltl weight per shipment as compared to 2017 we believe these increases were driven by a stronger us domestic economy and market share gains resulting from increased demand for the consistent levels of superior service that we provide to our customers

 

ltl revenue per hundredweight increased 9  6 to 2125 in 201 8 as com pared to 2017  we believe the continued increase in our revenue per hundredweight reflects our consistent yield management process and a favorable pricing environment that resulted from general capacity constraints in the transportation industry our ltl revenue and yield were also positively impacted b y an inc rease in fuel surcharges in 2018 as compared to 201 7  excluding fuel surcharges ltl revenue per hundredweight increased 69  in 2018 compared to 2017 

 

most of our tariffs and contracts provide for a fuel surcharge that is generally indexed to the diesel fuel prices published by the doe which reset each week our fuel surcharges are designed to offset fluctuations in the cost of petroleumbased products and are one of the many components included in the overall negotiated price we charge for our services as a percent of revenue fuel surcharges increased to 133 in 2018 from 111 in 2017 this increase was due primarily to an increase in the average price per gallon for diesel fuel during 2018 as compared to 2017 we regularly monitor the components of our pricing including base freight rates and fuel surcharges we also address any individual account profitability issues with our customers as part of our effort to minimize the negative impact on our profitability that would likely result from a rapid and significant change in any of our operating expenses

 

january 2019 update

 

revenue per day increased 83 in january 2019 compared to the same month last year ltl tons per day decreased 15 due primarily to a 44 decrease in weight per shipment that was slightly offset by a 30 increase in ltl shipments ltl revenue per hundredweight increased approximately 98 as compared to the same month last year

operating costs and other expenses

salaries wages and benefits increased 2732 million or 152 in 2018 due to a 2016 million increase in salaries and wages and a 716 million increase in benefit costs the increase in the costs attributable to salaries and wages was due primarily to an increase in the number of fulltime employees and increases in our employees’ wages our average number of fulltime employees increased 142 during 2018 as compared to 2017 to support our shipment growth salaries and wages also increased as a result of higher performancebased compensation and annual wage increases provided to our employees at the beginning of both september 2018 and september 2017 in addition o ur costs were also impacted by productivity declines in our platform and pd operations related to training of our new employees although our costs increased our aggregate productive labor costs as a percent of revenue improved to 270 in 2018 compared to 283 in 2017 our indirect salaries and wages as a percent of revenue also improved to 115 in 2018 compared to 120 in 2017 

 

employee benefit costs increased 716 million or 159 due primarily to the increase in our average number of fulltime employees enhancements to our employees’ paid time off benefits implemented in 2018 and higher 401k benefits directly linked to the increase in our net income the change in our benefit costs was also impacted by a decrease in the costs of certain retirement benefits directly linked to the market price of our common stock and lower workers’ compensation cost per employee in 2018 as compared to 2017 as a percent of salaries and wages our benefit costs increased to 335 in 2018 compared to 332 in 2017 

operating supplies and expenses increased 1092 million or 286 in 2018 as compared to 2017 due primarily to increased costs of diesel fuel the cost of diesel fuel excluding fuel taxes represents the largest component of operating supplies and expenses and can vary based on both average price per gallon and consumption the increase in our diesel fuel costs excluding fuel taxes was due primarily to a 249 increase in our average cost per gallon of diesel fuel during 2018 in addition our gallons consumed increased 108 in 2018 as compared to 2017 due primarily to an 111 increase in linehaul and pd miles driven we do not use diesel fuel hedging instruments therefore our costs are subject to market price fluctuations

depreciation and amortization increased 246 million or 120 due primarily to the assets acquired as part of our 2017 and 2018 capital expenditure programs we believe depreciation will continue to increase based on our 2019 capital expenditure program while our investments in real estate equipment and technology can increase our costs in the shortterm we believe these investments are necessary to support our continued longterm growth and strategic initiatives 

our effective tax rate in 2018 was 257 as compared to 195 in 2017 our provision for income taxes in 2017 included a 1049 million income tax benefit resulting from the revaluation of our deferred tax liabilities in connection with the passage of the tax act in december 2017 the tax act also lowered the federal statutory rate to 21 from 35 beginning in 2018 our effective tax rate generally exceeds the federal statutory rate due to the impact of state taxes and to a lesser extent certain other nondeductible items

 

2017 compared to 201 6 

key financial and operating metrics for 2017 and 2016 are presented below 

 



 

revenue

revenue increased 3666 million or 123 as compared to 2016 due to a 3640 million increase in ltl revenue and a 26 million increase in nonltl revenue ltl revenue was higher in 2017 due to increases in both ltl tons and yield the 74 increase in ltl tons during 2017 resulted from a 58 increase in ltl shipments and a 15 increase in ltl weight per shipment as compared to 2016 we believe our tonnage growth in 2017 was driven by a stronger economic environment and market share gains resulting from increased demand for the consistent levels of premium service that we provide to our customers

ltl revenue per hundredweight increased 48 to 1939 in 2017 as compared to 2016 despite the downward pressure on this metric created by the increase in our ltl weight per shipment and the decline in our average length of haul we believe this increase in our ltl revenue per hundredweight reflected our continued focus on yield management which benefited from a favorable pricing environment our ltl revenue and yield were also positively impacted by an increase in fuel surcharges in 2017 as compared to 2016 excluding fuel surcharges ltl revenue per hundredweight increased 29 in 2017 as compared to 2016

most of our tariffs and contracts provide for a fuel surcharge that is generally indexed to the doe’s published diesel fuel prices that reset each week our fuel surcharges are designed to offset fluctuations in the cost of petroleumbased products and are one of the many components included in the overall negotiated price we charge for our services as a percent of revenue fuel surcharges increased to 111 in 2017 from 95 in 2016 this increase was due primarily to an increase in the average price per gallon for diesel fuel during 2017 as compared to 2016 we regularly monitor the components of our pricing including base freight rates and fuel surcharges we also address any individual account profitability issues with our customers as part of our effort to minimize the negative impact on our profitability that would likely result from a rapid and significant change in any of our operating expenses

operating costs and other expenses

salaries wages and benefits increased 1504 million or 91 in 2017 due to a 1223 million increase in salaries and wages and a 281 million increase in benefit costs the increase in the costs attributable to salaries and wages was due primarily to the 30 increase in the average number of fulltime employees in 2017 annual wage increases provided to our employees in september 2016 and 2017 and higher performancebased compensation linked to our operating results in addition we paid a special bonus to all nonexecutive employees in december 2017 following passage of the tax act that totaled 98 million although our costs increased our aggregate productive labor costs as a percent of revenue decreased to 283 for 2017 from 289 for 2016 and our other indirect salaries and wages as a percent of revenue decreased to 120 for 2017 from 122 for 2016

employee benefit costs increased 281 million or 67 due primarily to an increase in our average number of fulltime employees and higher wage rates which led to higher payrollrelated taxes and paidtimeoff benefits our employee benefit costs also increased for certain retirement benefit plans directly linked to the improvement in our net income and the share price of our common stock our group health costs and workers’ compensation expenses decreased as a percent of salaries and wages which contributed to the overall improvement in total employee benefit costs as a percent of salaries and wages to 332 for 2017 from 342 for 2016

operating supplies and expenses increased 588 million or 182 in 2017 as compared to 2016 due primarily to increased costs of diesel fuel the cost of diesel fuel excluding fuel taxes represents the largest component of operating supplies and expenses and can vary based on both average price per gallon and consumption the increase in our diesel fuel costs excluding fuel taxes was 

 

due primarily to a 235 increase in our average cost per gallon of diesel fuel during 2017 in addition our gallons consumed increased 43 in 2017 as compared to 2016 due primarily to a 45 increase in linehaul and pd miles driven we do not use diesel fuel hedging instruments and our costs are therefore subject to market price fluctuations 

general supplies and expenses increased 211 million or 244 in 2017 as compared to 2016 the increase was due primarily to an increase in our advertising and marketing costs and higher costs for technology and related support

depreciation and amortization increased 159 million or 84 due primarily to the assets acquired as part of our 2016 and 2017 capital expenditure programs these costs however were relatively consistent as a percent of revenue between the periods compared while our investments in real estate equipment and technology can increase our costs in the shortterm we believe these investments are necessary to support our continued growth and strategic initiatives

our effective tax rate in 2017 was 195 as compared to 381 in 2016 our provision for income taxes in 2017 included a 1049 million income tax benefit resulting from the revaluation of our deferred tax liabilities in connection with the passage of the tax act in december 2017 in addition our effective tax rates for 2017 and 2016 were favorably impacted by various tax credits our effective tax rate generally exceeds the federal statutory rate due to the impact of state taxes and to a lesser extent certain other nondeductible items

liquidity and capital resources

a summary of our cash flows is presented below

 



 

the change in our cash flows provided by operating activities during 2018 as compared to 2017 was impacted by an increase in income before income taxes of 2397 million an increase in depreciation and amortization of 246 million a decrease in income taxes paid of 294 million and fluctuations in certain working capital accounts

 

the change in our cash flows provided by operating activities during 2017 was impacted by an increase in income before income taxes of 982 million and an increase in depreciation and amortization of 159 million these increases were more than offset by an increase in income taxes paid of 760 million and other fluctuations in certain working capital accounts

the changes in cash flows used in investing activities for all periods were due to the timing of equipment purchases under our capital expenditure plans changes in our capital expenditures are more fully described below in “capital expenditures”

the changes in cash flows used in financing activities for all periods were due primarily to fluctuations in capital returned to shareholders and fluctuations in our longterm debt which includes our senior unsecured revolving line of credit our financing arrangements are more fully described below under “financing agreements” our return of capital to shareholders is more fully described below under “stock repurchase program” and “dividends to shareholders” respectively

we have three primary sources of available liquidity cash and cash equivalents cash flows from operations and available borrowings under our senior unsecured revolving credit agreement which is described below we believe we also have sufficient access to debt and equity markets to provide other sources of liquidity if needed

 

capital expenditures 

the table below sets forth our net capital expenditures for property and equipment including those obtained through capital leases for the years ended december 31 2018 2017 and 2016

 



 

our capital expenditures varied based upon the projected increase in the number and size of our service center facilities to support our plan for longterm growth our planned tractor and trailer replacement cycle and forecasted tonnage and shipment growth expenditures for land and structures can be dependent upon the availability of land in the geographic areas where we are looking to expand we expect to continue to maintain a high level of capital expenditures in order to support our longterm plan for market share growth

we currently estimate capital expenditures will be approximately 490 million for the year ending december 31 2019 approximately 220 million is allocated for the purchase of service center facilities construction of new service center facilities or expansion of existing service center facilities subject to the availability of suitable real estate and the timing of construction projects approximately 175 million is allocated for the purchase of tractors and trailers and approximately 95 million is allocated for investments in technology and other assets we expect to fund these capital expenditures primarily through cash flows from operations our existing cash and cash equivalents and the use of our senior unsecured revolving credit facility we believe our current sources of liquidity will be sufficient to satisfy our expected capital expenditures

stock repurchase program

our stock repurchase program which was previously announced on may 23 2016 and pursuant to which we could repurchase up to an aggregate of 2500 million of our outstanding common stock expired in accordance with its terms during the second quarter of 2018 on may 17 2018 we announced that our board of directors had approved a new twoyear stock repurchase program authorizing us to repurchase up to an aggregate of 2500 million of our outstanding common stock the “2018 repurchase program” under the 2018 repurchase program which became effective upon the expiration of our prior stock repurchase program we may repurchase shares from time to time in open market purchases or through privately negotiated transactions shares of our common stock repurchased under our repurchase programs are canceled at the time of repurchase and are classified as authorized but unissued shares of our common stock 

during the years ended december 31 2018 2017 and 2016 we repurchased 1175565 91921 and 2062841 shares of our common stock under our repurchase programs for an aggregate of 1633 million 80 million and 1303 million respectively as of december 31 2018 we had 1317 million remaining authorized under the 2018 repurchase program 

dividends to shareholders

 

our board of directors declared a cash dividend of 013 per share for each quarter of 2018 and a cash dividend of 010 per share for each quarter of 2017 we did not declare or pay any dividends on our common stock during 2016

 

on february 7 2019 we announced that our board of directors had declared a cash dividend of 017 per share of our common stock the dividend is payable on march 20 2019 to shareholders of record at the close of business on march 6 2019 although we intend to pay a quarterly cash dividend on our common stock for the foreseeable future the declaration and amount of any future dividend is subject to approval by our board of directors and is restricted by applicable state law limitations on distributions to shareholders as well as certain covenants under our revolving credit facility we anticipate that any future quarterly cash dividends will be funded through cash flows from operations and if needed borrowings under our revolving credit facility 

financing agreements

we had one unsecured senior note agreement with a principal amount outstanding of 450 million and 950 million at december 31 2018 and december 31 2017 respectively our unsecured senior note agreement called for a scheduled principal 

 

payment of 500 million which was paid on january 3 2018  a second scheduled prin cipal payment of 450 million is due on january 3 2021 interest rates on the january 3 2018 and january 3 2021 scheduled principal payments were and are 400 and 479 respectively the effective average interest rate on our outstanding senior note agreement was 479 and 437 at december 31  2018 and december 31 2017 respectively 

on december 15 2015 we entered into an amended and restated credit agreement with wells fargo bank national association “wells fargo” serving as administrative agent for the lenders the “credit agreement” the credit agreement originally provided for a fiveyear 2500 million senior unsecured revolving line of credit and a 1000 million accordion feature which if fully exercised and approved would expand the total borrowing capacity up to an aggregate of 3500 million

on september 9 2016 we exercised a portion of the accordion feature and entered into an amendment to the credit agreement to increase the aggregate commitments from existing lenders by 500 million to an aggregate of 3000 million of the 3000 million line of credit commitments under the credit agreement as amended up to 1000 million may be used for letters of credit

at our option borrowings under the credit agreement bear interest at either i libor plus an applicable margin based on our ratio of net debttototal capitalization that ranges from 10 to 150 or ii a base rate plus an applicable margin based on our ratio of net debttototal capitalization that ranges from 00 to 05 letter of credit fees equal to the applicable margin for libor loans are charged quarterly in arrears on the daily average aggregate stated amount of all letters of credit outstanding during the quarter commitment fees ranging from 0125 to 02 based upon the ratio of net debttototal capitalization are charged quarterly in arrears on the aggregate unutilized portion of the credit agreement

for periods covered under the credit agreement the applicable margin on libor loans and letter of credit fees were 10 and commitment fees were 0125

the amounts outstanding and available borrowing capacity under the credit agreement are presented below

 



 

with the exception of borrowings pursuant to the credit agreement interest rates are fixed on all of our debt instruments therefore shortterm exposure to fluctuations in interest rates is limited to our line of credit facility we do not currently use interest rate derivative instruments to manage exposure to interest rate changes

our senior note agreement and credit agreement contain customary covenants including financial covenants that require us to observe a maximum ratio of debt to total capital and a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio any future whollyowned material domestic subsidiaries of the company would be required to guarantee payment of all of our obligations under these agreements the credit agreement also includes a provision limiting our ability to make restricted payments including dividends and payments for share repurchases unless among other conditions no defaults or events of default are ongoing or would be caused by such restricted payment we were in compliance with all covenants in our outstanding debt instruments for the period ended december 31 2018

a significant decrease in demand for our services could limit our ability to generate cash flow and affect our profitability most of our debt agreements have covenants that require stated levels of financial performance which if not achieved could cause acceleration of the payment schedules as of december 31 2018 we were in compliance with these covenants we do not anticipate a significant decline in business levels or financial performance that would cause us to violate any such covenants in the future and we believe the combination of our existing credit agreement along with our additional borrowing capacity will be sufficient to meet foreseeable seasonal and longterm capital needs

 

contractual obligations 

the following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations as of december 31 2018

 



 



critical accounting policies

in preparing our financial statements we apply the following critical accounting policies that we believe affect our judgments and estimates of amounts recorded in certain assets liabilities revenue and expenses these critical accounting policies are further described in note 1 of the notes to the financial statements included in item 8 of this report

revenue recognition

our revenue is generated from providing transportation and related services to customers in accordance with the bill of lading “bol” contract our general tariff provisions and contractual agreements generally our performance obligations begin when we receive a bol from a customer and are satisfied when we complete the delivery of a shipment and related services we recognize revenue for our performance obligations under our customer contracts over time as our customers receive the benefits of our services in accordance with accounting standards update “asu” 201409 with respect to services not completed at the end of a reporting period we use a percentage of completion method to allocate the appropriate revenue to each separate reporting period under this method we develop a factor for each uncompleted shipment by dividing the actual number of days in transit at the end of a reporting period by that shipment’s standard delivery time schedule this factor is applied to the total revenue for that shipment and revenue is allocated between reporting periods accordingly payment terms vary by customer and are shortterm in nature

allowances for uncollectible accounts and revenue adjustments

we maintain an allowance for uncollectible accounts for estimated losses resulting from the failure of our customers to make required payments we estimate this allowance by analyzing the aging of our customer receivables our historical loss experience and other trends and factors affecting the credit risk of our customers we determine customer receivables to be past due when payment has not been received by the invoice due date writeoffs occur when we determine an account to be uncollectible and could differ from our allowance estimate as a result of factors such as changes in the overall economic environment or risks surrounding our customers additional allowances may be required if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments we periodically review the underlying assumptions in our estimate of the allowance for uncollectible accounts to ensure that the allowance reflects the most recent trends and factors

we also maintain an allowance for estimated revenue adjustments resulting from future billing corrections customer allowances moneyback service guarantees and other miscellaneous revenue adjustments these revenue adjustments are recorded in our revenue from operations we use historical experience trends and current information to update and evaluate these estimates

claims and insurance accruals

claims and insurance accruals reflect the estimated cost of claims for cargo loss and damage bipd workers’ compensation group health and dental the related costs are charged to insurance and claims expense except for workers’ compensation group health and dental which are charged to employee benefits expense

insurers providing excess coverage above a company’s sir or deductible levels typically adjust their premiums to cover insured losses and for other market factors as a result we periodically evaluate our sir and deductible levels to determine the most costefficient balance between our exposure and excess coverage

 

in establishing accruals for claims and expenses we evaluate and monitor each claim individually and we use factors such as historical claims development experience known trends and thirdparty estimates to determine the appropriate r eserves for potential liability we believe the assumptions and methods used to estimate these liabilities are reasonable however any changes in the severity of previouslyreported claims significant changes in medical costs and regulatory changes affec ting the administration of our plans could significantly impact the determination of appropriate reserves in future periods 

property and equipment

property and equipment are recorded at cost and depreciated on a straightline basis over their estimated economic lives we use historical experience certain assumptions and estimates in determining the economic life of each asset when indicators of impairment exist we review property and equipment for impairment due to changes in operational and market conditions and we adjust the carrying value and economic life of any impaired asset as appropriate

estimated economic lives for structures are 7 to 30 years revenue equipment is 4 to 15 years other equipment is 2 to 20 years and leasehold improvements are the lesser of the economic life of the leasehold improvement or the remaining life of the lease the use of different assumptions estimates or significant changes in the resale market for our equipment could result in material changes in the carrying value and related depreciation of our assets

inflation

most of our expenses are affected by inflation which typically results in increased operating costs in response to fluctuations in the cost of petroleum products particularly diesel fuel we generally include a fuel surcharge in our tariffs and contractual agreements the fuel surcharge is designed to offset the cost of diesel fuel above a base price and fluctuates as diesel fuel prices change from the base which is generally indexed to the doe’s published fuel prices that reset each week volatility in the price of diesel fuel independent of inflation has impacted our business as described in this report however we do not believe inflation has had a material effect on our results of operations for any of the past three years

related party transactions

family relationships

each of earl e congdon david s congdon and john r congdon jr are related to one another and served in various management positions andor on our board of directors during 2018 our employment agreement with earl e congdon which expired in accordance with its terms on november 1 2018 and our employment agreement with david s congdon are incorporated by reference as exhibits to this annual report on form 10k we regularly disclose the amount of compensation that we pay to these individuals as well as the compensation paid to any of their family members employed by us that from time to time may require disclosure in the proxy statement for our annual meeting of shareholders

transactions with old dominion truck leasing inc

prior to 2018 we utilized the services of old dominion truck leasing inc “leasing” leased property to leasing and collaborated with leasing for the purchase of certain equipment and fuel leasing which historically had been primarily engaged in the business of leasing tractors trailers and other vehicles as well as providing contract dedicated fleet services was acquired by penske truck leasing during the third quarter of 2017 the “penske acquisition” prior to the penske acquisition john r congdon jr served as leasing’s chairman of the board and ceo and earl e congdon and david s congdon each served on leasing’s board of directors

our business relationships with leasing as well as the positions held at leasing by john r congdon jr earl e congdon and david s congdon ceased in the third quarter of 2017 in connection with the penske acquisition prior to the penske acquisition we purchased 110000 and 254000 of maintenance and other services from leasing in 2017 and 2016 respectively in addition we received 6000 and 12000 from leasing for the rental of property in 2017 and 2016 respectively

audit committee approval

the audit committee of our board of directors reviewed and approved all of the related person transactions described above in accordance with our related person transactions policy




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk

market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact our financial position results of operations and cash flows due to adverse changes in financial market prices and rates

 

we are exposed to interest rate risk directly related to loans if any under our credit agreement which have variable interes t rates a 100 basis point increase in the average interest rate on this agreement would have no material effect on our operating results we have established policies and procedures to manage exposure to market risks and use major institutions that we bel ieve are creditworthy to minimize credit risk 

we are exposed to market risk for investments relating to companyowned life insurance contracts on certain current and former employees the cash surrender value for variable life insurance contracts was 457 million of the 477 million and 509 million of the 531 million of aggregate cash surrender values for all life insurance contracts included on our balance sheets at december 31 2018 and 2017 respectively the underlying investments in our variable life insurance contracts expose us to market fluctuations to provide a meaningful assessment of the market risk for investments relating to companyowned life insurance contracts we performed a sensitivity analysis using a 10 change in market value in those investments on december 31 2018 a 10 change in market value would have caused a 46 million and a 51 million impact on our pretax income in 2018 and 2017 respectively

we are exposed to market risk for awards previously granted under our employee and director phantom stock plans the liability for the unsettled outstanding awards is remeasured at the end of each reporting period based on the price of our common stock the total liability for unsettled awards granted under these phantom stock plans totaled 572 million and 566 million at december 31 2018 and 2017 respectively to provide a meaningful assessment of market risk for our employee and director phantom stock plans we performed a sensitivity analysis using a 10 change in the price of our common stock at december 31 2018 a 10 change in market value of our common stock would have caused a 57 million impact on our operating income with respect to these plans in both 2018 and 2017 respectively

we are also exposed to commodity price risk related to diesel fuel prices and we manage our exposure to that risk primarily through the application of fuel surcharges to our customers

unless the context requires otherwise references in this report to “old dominion” the “company” “we” “us” and “our” refer to old dominion freight line inc 

overview 

we are a leading lessthantruckload “ltl” unionfree motor carrier providing regional interregional and national ltl services which include ground and air expedited transportation and consumer household pickup and delivery pd through a single integrated organization in addition to our core ltl services we offer a range of valueadded services including container drayage truckload brokerage supply chain consulting and warehousing more than 97 of our revenue has historically been derived from transporting ltl shipments for our customers whose demand for our services is generally tied to industrial production and the overall health of the us domestic economy 

we have grown to be the fourth largest ltl motor carrier in the united states as measured by 2016 revenue from the sixth largest ltl motor carrier in the united states as measured by 2011 revenue according to transport topics  we have increased our revenue and customer base over this fiveyear period primarily through organic market share growth our infrastructure allows us to provide nextday and secondday service through each of our regions covering the continental united states we opened 10 and 22 new service centers over the past five and ten years respectively for a total of 228  service centers at december 31 2017  we believe this expansion produced increased capacity within our service center network and provides us with opportunities for future growth 

we believe the growth in demand for our services can be attributed to our ability to consistently provide a superior level of customer service at a fair price which allows our customers to meet their supply chain needs our integrated structure allows us to offer our customers consistent highquality service from origin to destination and we believe our operating structure and proprietary information systems enable us to efficiently manage our operating costs our services are complemented by our technological capabilities which we believe provide the tools to improve the efficiency of our operations while also empowering our customers to manage their individual shipping needs 

we were founded in 1934 and incorporated in virginia in 1950 our principal executive offices are located at 500 old dominion way thomasville north carolina 27360 please refer to the balance sheets and statements of operations included in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” in this report for information regarding our total assets revenue from operations and net income 

our industry 

trucking companies provide transportation services to virtually every industry operating in the united states and generally offer higher levels of reliability and faster transit times than other surface transportation options the trucking industry is comprised principally of two types of motor carriers ltl and truckload ltl freight carriers typically pick up multiple shipments from multiple customers on a single truck the ltl freight is then routed through a network of service centers where the freight may be transferred to other trucks with similar destinations ltl motor carriers generally require a more expansive network of local pd service centers as well as larger breakbulk or hub facilities in contrast truckload carriers generally dedicate an entire truck to one customer from origin to destination 

significant capital is required to create and maintain a network of service centers and a fleet of tractors and trailers the high fixed costs and capital spending requirements for ltl motor carriers make it difficult for new startup or small operators to effectively compete with established carriers in addition successful ltl motor carriers generally employ and regularly update a high level of technologybased systems and processes that provide information to customers and help reduce operating costs 

according to the american trucking associations the trucking industry accounted for 798 of the 8476 billion total us transportation revenue in 2016 the ltl sector had revenue in 2016 of 547 billion which represented 65 of total us transportation revenue the ltl industry is highly competitive on the basis of service and price and has consolidated significantly since the industry was deregulated in 1980 based on 2016 revenue as reported in transport topics  the largest 10 and 25 ltl motor carriers accounted for approximately 51 and 62 respectively of the total ltl market we believe consolidation in our industry will continue due to customer demand for transportation providers offering both national and regional ltl as well as other complementary valueadded services 

competition 

the transportation and logistics industry is intensely competitive and highly fragmented we compete with regional interregional and national ltl carriers and to a lesser extent with truckload carriers small package carriers airfreight carriers and railroads we also compete with and provide transportation services to thirdparty logistics providers that determine both the mode of transportation and the carrier some of our competitors may have a broader global network and a wider range of services than we do competition in our industry is based primarily on service price available capacity and business relationships we believe we are able to gain market share by expanding our capacity and providing highquality service at a fair price 

throughout our organization we continuously seek to improve customer service by maximizing ontime performance and minimizing cargo claims we believe our transit times are generally faster and more reliable than those of our principal national competitors in part because of our more efficient service center network use of team drivers and proprietary technology in addition we provide greater geographic coverage than most of our regional competitors our diversified mix and scope of regional interregional and national ltl service combined with our valueadded service offerings enables us to provide our customers with a single source to meet their shipping and logistics needs we believe the combination of these factors provides us with a distinct advantage over most of our competitors 

we utilize flexible scheduling and train our employees to perform multiple tasks which we believe allows us to achieve greater productivity and higher levels of customer service than our competitors we believe our focus on employee communication continued education development and motivation strengthens the relationships and trust among our employees 

service center operations 

at december 31 2017  we operated 228  service center locations of which we owned 194  and leased 34  our network includes ten major breakbulk facilities located in rialto california atlanta georgia columbus ohio indianapolis indiana greensboro north carolina harrisburg pennsylvania memphis and morristown tennessee dallas texas and salt lake city utah while using various other service centers for additional limited breakbulk activity in order to serve our nextday markets our service centers are strategically located throughout the country so that we can provide the highest quality service and minimize freight rehandling costs 

our service centers are responsible for the pickup and delivery of freight within their local service area each night our service centers load outbound freight for transport to our other service centers for delivery all inbound freight received by the service center in the evening or during the night is generally scheduled for local delivery the next business day unless a 

customer requests a different delivery schedule our management reviews the productivity and service performance of each service center on a daily basis to ensure quality service and efficient operations 

although we have established primary responsibility for customer service at the local service center level our customers may access information and initiate transactions through our centralized customer service department located at our corporate office or through other electronic gateways our systems allow us to offer our customers access to information such as freight tracking shipping documents rate quotes rate databases and account activity these centralized systems and our customer service department provide our customers with a single point of contact to access information across all areas of our operations and for each of our service offerings 

linehaul transportation 

linehaul dispatchers control the movement of freight between service centers through integrated freight movement systems we also utilize loadplanning software to optimize efficiencies in our linehaul operations our management team monitors freight movements transit times load factors and many other productivity measurements to help ensure that we maintain our high levels of service and efficiency 

we utilize scheduled routes and additional linehaul dispatches as necessary to meet our published transit times in addition we gain efficiency through the use of twin 28foot trailers in our linehaul operations the use of twin 28foot trailers permits us to transport freight directly from its point of origin to destination with minimal unloading and reloading which also reduces cargo loss and damage expenses we utilize longcombination vehicles such as triple 28foot trailers and combinations of 48foot and 28foot trailers in states where permitted twin trailers and longcombination vehicles permit more freight to be transported behind a tractor than could otherwise be transported by one trailer 

tractors trailers and maintenance 

at december 31 2017  we owned 8316  tractors we generally use new tractors in linehaul operations for approximately three to five years and then transfer those tractors to pd operations for the remainder of their useful lives in many of our service centers tractors perform pd functions during the day and linehaul functions at night to maximize tractor utilization 

the table below reflects as of december 31 2017  the average age of our tractors and trailers 



we develop certain specifications for tractors and trailers and then negotiate the production and purchase of this equipment with several manufacturers these purchases are planned well in advance of anticipated delivery dates in order to accommodate manufacturers’ production schedules we believe there is sufficient capacity among suppliers to ensure an uninterrupted supply of equipment to support our operations 

the table below sets forth our capital expenditures for tractors and trailers for the years ended december 31 2017  2016  and 2015  for more information concerning our capital expenditures see item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations – liquidity and capital resources” in this report 



at december 31 2017  we operated 39 maintenance centers at strategic service center locations throughout our network these maintenance centers are equipped to perform routine and preventive maintenance and repairs on our equipment 

we adhere to established maintenance policies and procedures to help ensure our fleet is properly maintained tractors are routed to appropriate maintenance facilities at designated mileage intervals or every 90 days whichever occurs first trailers are also scheduled for preventative maintenance every 90 days 

customers 

revenue is generated primarily from customers throughout the united states and north america in 2017  our largest customer accounted for approximately 37 of our revenue and our largest 5 10 and 20 customers accounted for 112 170 and 236 of our revenue respectively for each of the previous three years more than 95 of our revenue was derived from services performed in the united states and less than 5 of our revenue was generated from services performed internationally we believe the diversity of our customer base helps protect our business from adverse developments in a single geographic region and from the reduction or loss of business from a single customer 

we utilize an integrated freightcosting system to determine the price level at which a particular shipment of freight will be profitable we can modify elements of this freightcosting model to simulate the actual conditions under which the freight will be moved many of our customers engage our services through the terms and provisions of our tariffs and through negotiated service contracts we also compete for business by participating in bid solicitations customers generally solicit bids for relatively large numbers of shipments for a period of one to two years and typically choose to enter into contractual arrangements with a limited number of motor carriers based upon price and service 

seasonality 

our tonnage levels and revenue mix are subject to seasonal trends common in our industry although other factors such as macroeconomic changes could cause variation in these trends our revenue and operating margins in the first and fourth quarters are typically lower than those during the second and third quarters due to reduced shipments during the winter months harsh winter weather or natural disasters such as hurricanes tornadoes and floods can also adversely impact our performance by reducing demand and increasing operating expenses we believe seasonal trends will continue to impact our business 

technology 

our technology is critical to the success and delivery of the premium service provided by our operations we continually seek to upgrade and enhance our technological capabilities we also provide access to our systems through multiple gateways that offer our customers and employees maximum flexibility and immediate access to information we employ vehicle safety systems onboard and handheld computer systems freight handling systems and logistics technology to reduce costs and transit times our data systems are integrated at every level within our organization which we believe is critical to our success our systems are protected through physical and software safeguards as well as redundant systems network security measures and backup systems we continue to focus on the development and enhancement of the technology used in our operations in order to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of our services 

insurance 

we carry a significant amount of insurance with thirdparty insurance carriers but we are exposed to the risk of loss on claims up to the limit for which we hold either a selfinsured retention sir or deductible at december 31 2017  the amounts of our sir andor deductibles were as follows 

 million aggregate corridor deductible applicable per annual policy period to any claim that exceeds 50 million and occurs after march 30 2016 

• 100000 per occurrence for cargo loss and damage 

• 10 million per occurrence for workers’ compensation claims and 

• 10 million per covered person paid during 2017 for group health claims 

we believe that our policy of maintaining an sir or deductible for a portion of our risks supported by our safety and loss prevention programs is an effective means of managing insurance costs we periodically review our risk exposure and insurance coverage applicable to those risks and we believe that we maintain sufficient insurance coverage 

diesel fuel availability and cost 

we depend heavily upon the availability and quality of diesel fuel to provide our transportation services we maintain fuel storage and pumping facilities at certain service center locations as the primary source for fueling our fleet and we utilize overtheroad fueling options at retail locations as necessary we could be susceptible to regional andor national fuel shortages which could cause us to incur additional expense in order to obtain an adequate supply within our own fueling network or cause us to rely more heavily on higherpriced retail fuel 

we believe our operations and financial condition are susceptible to the same diesel fuel price increases or shortages as those of our competitors we implemented a fuel surcharge program in august 1999 which has remained in effect since that time and is one of many components that we use to determine the overall price for our transportation services our fuel surcharges are generally indexed to fuel prices published by the us department of energy the “doe” that reset each week 

employees 

as of december 31 2017  we employed 19183  individuals on a fulltime basis none of which were represented under a collective bargaining agreement our fulltime employees work in the following roles 



as of december 31 2017  we employed 5311 linehaul drivers and 4876 pd drivers on a fulltime basis we select our drivers primarily based upon safe driving records and experience among other requirements our drivers must pass a drug test have a current us department of transportation “dot” physical and have a valid commercial driver’s license prior to employment once employed drivers are required to obtain and maintain hazardous materials endorsements to their commercial driver’s licenses drivers like all of our employees are required to take preemployment drug and alcohol tests and are randomly selected for periodic additional testing 

since 1988 we have provided the opportunity for qualified employees to become drivers through the “old dominion driver training program” there are currently 2892 active drivers who have successfully completed this training which was approximately 284 of our driver workforce as of december 31 2017  we believe our driver training and qualification programs have been important factors in improving our safety record and retaining qualified drivers in addition we have experienced an annual turnover rate for our driver graduates of approximately 59 which is below our companywide turnover rate for all drivers of approximately 80 

we reward our drivers who maintain safe driving records with annual bonuses of up to 3000 per driver our safety bonuses paid to drivers totaled 39 million 37 million and 34 million in 2017  2016  and 2015  respectively 

governmental regulation 

we are regulated by the dot and by various state agencies these regulatory authorities have broad powers over matters relating to authorized motor carrier operations as well as motor carrier registration driver hours of service safety and fitness of transportation equipment and drivers transportation of hazardous materials certain mergers and acquisitions and periodic financial reporting the trucking industry is also subject to regulatory and legislative changes from a variety of other governmental authorities which address matters such as increasingly stringent environmental regulations occupational safety and health regulations limits on vehicle weight and size ergonomics port security and driver hours of service 

in addition we are subject to compliance with cargosecurity and transportation regulations issued by the transportation security administration tsa and customs and border protection cbp within the us department of homeland security regulatory requirements and changes in regulatory requirements or guidance may affect our business or the economics of the industry by requiring changes in operating practices that could influence the demand for and increase the costs of providing transportation services 

driver hours of service 

in december 2011 the federal motor carrier safety administration the fmcsa issued revised rules governing hours of service for commercial truck drivers the 2011 rules and mandated compliance by july 1 2013 the 2011 rules reduced the maximum number of hours a truck driver could work each week to 70 hours from the former 82hour limit the 2011 rules maintained the maximum 11hour daily driving limit but required that drivers take a 30minute break prior to working beyond eight hours the 2011 rules also added restrictions to the “34hour restart” provision to include two rest periods between 1 am and 5 am and limited the use of the restart to once every 168 hours compliance with the 2011 rules on july 1 2013 required us to make certain changes in our operating procedures these changes increased our operating costs by limiting the productivity of our drivers 

in december 2014 the fmcsa temporarily suspended through the 2015 omnibus appropriations bill enforcement of the provisions requiring two rest periods between 1 am and 5 am and the 168hour minimum restart restriction in connection with the temporary suspension congress requested that the fmcsa conduct a study to determine whether two rest periods between 1 am and 5 am and the limited use of one restart every 168 hours significantly improved safety benefits in december 2016 congress enacted legislation providing that if the fmcsa study demonstrated significant safety benefits attributable to these two rest periods and the 168hour minimum restart restriction then these two restrictions to the “34hour restart” provision would be reinstated if the fmcsa’s study did not support the safety benefits the suspension would remain in effect in march 2017 the final fmcsa study was submitted to congress and did not demonstrate significant safety benefits attributable to the two rest periods and the 168hour minimum restart restriction as a result the suspension remains in effect 

electronic logging devices 

in december 2015 the fmcsa issued a final rule mandating the use of electronic logging devices “elds” to automatically record drivers’ time for hours of service reporting generally carriers were required to comply with these new requirements by december 18 2017 we currently utilize eld rulecompliant automatic onboard recording devices aobrds in all of our companyowned vehicles and the aobrd data is integrated with our existing comprehensive fleet management and safety systems in order to maximize our ability to integrate aobrd data from vehicles purchased after december 18 2017 with these fleet management and safety systems we applied for and were granted a waiver from certain aspects of the eld rule by the fmcsa in january 2018 this waiver permits us to install eld devices running on aobrd software in newly purchased vehicles until march 18 2018 the fmcsa is currently considering a related request to extend this ability in the form of an exemption from the eld rule until december 18 2018 this extension would allow our aobrdeld thirdparty provider additional time to complete development of software that would integrate eld data as well as aobrd data with our existing comprehensive fleet management and safety systems regardless of whether the exemption is granted however we are wellpositioned to continue to optimize both the safety and efficiency of our fleet and remain compliant with the fmcsas eld regulations and guidance 

commercial drivers license drug and alcohol clearinghouse 

in december 2016 the fmcsa released a final rule establishing the commercial driver’s license drug and alcohol clearinghouse dac the dac is a database that will maintain records of drug and alcohol violations of commercial motor vehicle drivers the dac will require us to check prospective employees for drug and alcohol violations and all current driver employees must be checked at least annually the intent of the clearinghouse is to ensure that drivers cannot conceal drug and alcohol violations by changing jobs or locations compliance with this rule which provides for a threeyear implementation period is required by january 6 2020 

we are subject to future rulemaking by the fmcsa and other regulatory agencies which could be more stringent require additional changes to our operations increase our operating costs or otherwise adversely impact our results of operations 

environmental regulation 

we are subject to various federal state and local environmental laws and regulations that focus on among other things the emission and discharge of hazardous materials into the environment or their presence at our properties or in our vehicles fuel storage tanks transportation of certain materials and the discharge or retention of storm water under specific environmental laws we could also be held responsible for any costs relating to contamination at our past or present facilities and at thirdparty waste disposal sites as well as costs associated with cleanup of accidents involving our vehicles we do not believe that the cost of future compliance with current environmental laws or regulations will have a material adverse effect on our operations financial condition competitive position or capital expenditures for the remainder of 2018  or fiscal year 2019 

however future changes to laws or regulations may adversely affect our operations and could result in unforeseen costs to our business

 item 1a risk factors 

various factors exist that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those projected in any forwardlooking statement in addition to the factors discussed elsewhere in this report we believe the following are some of the important risks and uncertainties that could materially affect our business financial condition or results of operations 

we operate in a highly competitive industry and our business will suffer if we are unable to adequately address potential downward pricing pressures and other factors that may adversely affect our operations and profitability 

numerous competitive factors could impair our ability to maintain our current profitability these factors include but are not limited to the following 

 

if we are unable to effectively compete with other ltl carriers whether on the basis of price service or otherwise we may be unable to retain existing customers or attract new customers either of which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations furthermore continued merger and acquisition activity in transportation and logistics could result in stronger or new competitors which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial 

condition and results of operations we may not be able to compete successfully in an increasingly consolidated ltl industry and cannot predict with certainty how industry consolidation will affect our competitors or us 

if our employees were to unionize our operating costs would increase and our ability to compete would be impaired 

none of our employees are currently represented under a collective bargaining agreement however from time to time there have been efforts to organize our employees at various service centers further congress or one or more states could approve legislation andor the national labor relations board could render decisions or implement rule changes that could significantly affect our business and our relationship with our employees including actions that could substantially liberalize the procedures for union organization in addition we can offer no assurance that the department of labor will not adopt new regulations or interpret existing regulations in a manner that would favor the agenda of unions or that our employees will not unionize in the future particularly if regulatory changes occur that facilitate unionization 

the unionization of our employees could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations because 

 

if we are unable to successfully execute our growth strategy and develop market and consistently deliver highquality services that meet customer expectations our business and future results of operations may suffer 

our growth strategy includes increasing the volume of freight moving through our existing service center network selectively expanding our capacity and broadening the scope of our service offerings in connection with our growth strategy at various times we have expanded and upgraded service centers purchased additional equipment and increased our sales and marketing efforts and we expect to continue to do so our growth strategy exposes us to a number of risks including the following 

 

we cannot ensure that we will overcome the risks associated with our growth strategy if we fail to overcome those risks we may not realize additional revenue or profits from our efforts we may incur additional expenses and as a result our financial position and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 

we may be unable to successfully consummate and integrate acquisitions as part of our growth strategy 

growth through acquisitions historically has been a key component of our ltl growth strategy in the future we may seek to acquire other ltl carriers as well as other complementary businesses exploration of potential acquisitions requires significant attention from our management team in addition we expect to compete for acquisition opportunities with other companies some of which may have greater financial and other resources than we do we cannot ensure that we will have sufficient cash to consummate an acquisition or otherwise be able to obtain financing for an acquisition if we are unable to access sufficient funding for potential acquisitions we may not be able to complete transactions that we otherwise find advantageous 

any subsequent acquisition will entail numerous risks including 

 

in addition we may have difficulty integrating any acquired business and its operations services and personnel into our existing operations and such integration may require a significant amount of time and effort by our management team to the extent we do not successfully avoid or overcome the risks or problems resulting from any acquisitions we undertake there could be a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our customers’ and suppliers’ businesses may be impacted by various economic factors such as recessions downturns in the economy global uncertainty and instability changes in us social political and regulatory conditions andor a disruption of financial markets which may decrease demand for our services 

adverse economic conditions both in the us and internationally can negatively affect our customers’ business levels the amount of transportation services they need their ability to pay for our services and overall freight levels any of which might impair our asset utilization additionally uncertainty and instability in the global economy and any other action that the us government may take to withdraw from or materially modify the north american free trade agreement and certain other international trade arrangements may lead to fewer goods being transported and could have a material adverse effect on our business financial conditions and results of operations customers encountering adverse economic conditions may be unable to obtain additional financing or financing under acceptable terms due to disruptions in the capital and credit markets these customers represent a greater potential for bad debt losses which may require us to increase our reserve for bad debt economic conditions resulting in bankruptcies of one or more of our large customers could have a significant impact on our financial position results of operations or liquidity in a particular year or quarter further when adverse economic times arise customers may select competitors that offer lower rates in an attempt to lower their costs and we might be forced to lower our rates or lose freight volumes 

our suppliers’ business levels also may be negatively affected by adverse economic conditions and changes in the political and regulatory environment both in the us and internationally or financial constraints which could lead to disruptions in the supply and availability of equipment parts and services critical to our operations a significant interruption in our normal supply chain could disrupt our operations increase our costs and negatively impact our ability to serve our customers 

we are also subject to cost increases outside of our control that could materially reduce our profitability if we are unable to increase our rates sufficiently such cost increases include but are not limited to increases in wage rates fuel prices interest rates taxes tolls license and registration fees insurance revenue equipment and healthcare for our employees 

difficulties attracting and retaining qualified drivers and maintenance technicians could result in increases in driver and technician compensation and could adversely affect our profitability our ability to maintain or grow our fleet and our ability to maintain our customer relationships 

from time to time we have experienced difficulty in attracting and retaining sufficient numbers of qualified drivers and such shortages may recur in the future due in part to the time commitment physical requirements our stringent hiring 

standards and current industry conditions the available pool of qualified employee drivers has been declining because of the intense competition for drivers we may face difficulty maintaining or increasing our number of drivers similarly in recent years there has been a decrease in the overall supply of skilled maintenance technicians particularly new technicians with qualifications from technical programs and schools which could make it more difficult to attract and retain skilled technicians the compensation we offer our drivers and technicians is subject to market conditions that may require increases in driver or technician compensation if we are unable to attract and retain a sufficient number of qualified drivers and technicians we could be required to adjust our compensation packages amend our hiring standards or operate with fewer trucks and face difficulty meeting customer demands any of which could adversely affect our growth and profitability 

the fmcsa’s csa initiative could adversely impact our ability to hire qualified drivers meet our growth projections and maintain our customer relationships each of which could adversely impact our results of operations 

the fmcsa’s compliance safety accountability initiative csa is an enforcement and compliance program designed to monitor and improve commercial motor vehicle safety by measuring the safety record of both the motor carrier and the driver these measurements are scored and used by the fmcsa to identify potential safety risks and to direct enforcement action 

our csa scores are dependent upon our safety and compliance experience which could change at any time in addition the safety standards prescribed in csa could change and our ability to maintain an acceptable score could be adversely impacted public disclosure of certain csa scores was restricted through the enactment of the fixing america’s surface transportation act of 2015 the “fast act” on december 4 2015 however the fast act does not restrict public disclosure of all data collected by the fmcsa if we receive unacceptable csa scores and this data is made available to the public our relationships with our customers could be damaged which could result in a loss of business 

the requirements of the csa could also shrink the industry’s pool of drivers as those with unfavorable scores could leave the industry as a result the costs to attract train and retain qualified drivers could increase in addition a shortage of qualified drivers could increase driver turnover decrease asset utilization limit growth and adversely impact our results of operations 

we operate in a highly regulated industry and increased costs of compliance with or liability for violation of existing or future regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business 

we are regulated by the dot and by various state agencies these regulatory authorities have broad powers over matters relating to authorized motor carrier operations as well as motor carrier registration driver hours of service safety and fitness of transportation equipment and drivers transportation of hazardous materials certain mergers and acquisitions and periodic financial reporting the trucking industry is also subject to regulatory and legislative changes from a variety of other governmental authorities which address matters such as increasingly stringent environmental regulations occupational safety and health regulations limits on vehicle weight and size ergonomics port security and driver hours of service we are also subject to the costs and potential adverse impact of compliance associated with addressing interoperability between electronic aobrds and elds in accordance with fmcsa’s eld regulations and guidance which includes our existing waiver and pending exemption request in addition we are subject to compliance with cargosecurity and transportation regulations issued by the tsa and cbp within the us department of homeland security regulatory requirements and changes in regulatory requirements or guidance may affect our business or the economics of the industry by requiring changes in operating practices that could influence the demand for and increase the costs of providing transportation services 

insurance and claims expenses could significantly reduce our profitability 

we are exposed to claims related to cargo loss and damage property damage personal injury workers’ compensation group health and group dental we have insurance coverage with thirdparty insurance carriers but we assume a significant portion of the risk associated with these claims due to our sirs and deductibles our operating results could be adversely affected if any of the following were to occur i the number or the severity of claims increases ii we are required to accrue or pay additional amounts because claims prove to be more severe than our original assessment or iii claims exceed our coverage amounts if claims exceed our sir or deductible levels insurance companies exit the transportation insurance marketplace or insurance market conditions change insurers could raise premiums for excess coverage to cover their expenses and anticipated future losses in addition insurance companies generally require us to collateralize our sir or deductible levels if these collateralization requirements increase our borrowing capacity could be adversely affected 

healthcare legislation may increase our costs and reduce our future profitability 

to attract and retain employees we maintain a competitive health insurance plan for our employees and their dependents we cannot predict the impact that any state or federal healthcare legislation or regulation will have on our operations but we expect costs associated with providing benefits under employee medical plans and healthcarerelated costs associated with workers compensation to continue to increase rising healthcare costs in the us could result in significant longterm costs to us which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results in addition rising healthcare costs could force us to make further changes to our benefits program which could negatively impact our ability to attract and retain employees 

we have significant ongoing cash requirements that could limit our growth and affect our profitability if we are unable to obtain sufficient capital 

our business is highly capital intensive we generally finance our capital expenditures and planned growth with existing cash cash flow from operations issuance of debt and through available borrowings under our existing senior unsecured credit agreement we may require additional capital to finance longterm real estate purchase opportunities and acquisitions which we may fund through additional debt or through equity offerings if we are unable to generate sufficient cash from our operations or raise capital by accessing the debt and equity markets we may be forced to limit our growth and operate our equipment for longer periods of time which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results 

our business also has significant ongoing operating cash requirements if our cash requirements are high or our cash flow from operations is low during particular periods we may need to seek additional financing which could be costly or difficult to obtain 

limited supply and increased costs of new equipment may adversely affect our earnings and cash flow 

we may face difficulty in purchasing new equipment due to decreased supply and increased costs investment in new equipment is a significant part of our annual capital expenditures and we require an available supply of tractors and trailers from equipment manufacturers to operate and grow our business we may also be subject to shortages in raw materials that are required for the production of critical operating equipment and supplies such as shortages in rubber or steel 

the price of our equipment may also be adversely affected in the future by regulations on newly manufactured tractors and diesel engines we are subject to regulations issued by the us environmental protection agency the “epa” and various state agencies particularly the california air resources board carb that have required progressive reductions in exhaust emissions from diesel engines we may become subject to new or more restrictive regulations or differing interpretations of existing regulations which may increase the cost of providing transportation services or adversely affect our results of operations we are also unable to predict how any future changes in us government policy will affect epa and carb regulation and enforcement these regulations have resulted in higher prices for tractors and diesel engines and increased operating and maintenance costs and there can be no assurance that continued increases in pricing or costs will not have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

we may be adversely impacted by fluctuations in the availability and price of diesel fuel 

diesel fuel is a critical component of our operations and a significant operating expense for our business future fluctuations in prices and diesel fuel availability could have a material adverse effect on our operating results diesel fuel prices and fuel availability can be impacted by factors beyond our control such as natural or manmade disasters adverse weather conditions political events disruption or failure of technology or information systems price and supply decisions by oil producing countries and cartels terrorist activities armed conflict and world supply and demand imbalances we maintain fuel storage and pumping facilities at many of our service center locations however we may be susceptible to fuel shortages at certain locations that could cause us to incur additional expense to ensure adequate supply on a timely basis and to prevent a disruption to our service schedules an interruption in the supply of diesel fuel could have a material adverse effect on our operating results 

we do not hedge against the risk of diesel fuel price increases an increase in diesel fuel prices or diesel fuel taxes or any change in federal or state regulations that results in such an increase could have a material adverse effect on our operating results we have fuel surcharge programs in place with a majority of our customers which help offset the negative impact of the 

increased cost of diesel fuel and other petroleumbased products however we also incur fuel costs that cannot be recovered even with respect to customers with which we maintain fuel surcharge programs such as those costs associated with empty miles or the time during which our engines are idling because our fuel surcharge recovery lags behind changes in fuel prices our fuel surcharge recovery may not capture the increased costs we pay for fuel especially when prices are rising leading to fluctuations in our levels of reimbursement we regularly monitor the components of our pricing including fuel surcharges and address individual account profitability issues with our customers when necessary however there can be no assurance that fuel surcharges can be maintained indefinitely or will be sufficiently effective in offsetting increases in diesel fuel prices 

we are subject to various governmental laws and regulations and costs of compliance with liabilities under or violations of existing or future governmental laws or regulations could adversely affect our business 

we are subject to various federal state and local governmental laws and regulations that govern among other things the emission and discharge of hazardous materials into the environment the presence of hazardous materials at our properties or in our vehicles fuel storage tanks the transportation of certain materials and the discharge or retention of storm water under certain environmental laws we could also be held responsible for any costs relating to contamination at our past or present facilities and at thirdparty waste disposal sites as well as costs associated with the cleanup of accidents involving our vehicles environmental laws have become and may continue to be increasingly more stringent over time and there can be no assurance that our costs of complying with current or future environmental laws or liabilities arising under such laws will not have a material adverse effect on our business operations or financial condition 

in addition to epa and state agency regulations on exhaust emissions with which we must comply there is an increased regulatory focus on climate change and greenhouse gas emissions we are also subject to increasing sensitivity to sustainability issues this increased focus on sustainability may result in new regulations andor customer requirements that could adversely impact our business any future limitations on the emission of greenhouse gases other environmental legislation or customer sustainability requirements could increase our future capital expenditures and have an adverse impact on our financial condition results of operations and liquidity 

we are subject to the risks of litigation and governmental proceedings or inquiries which could adversely affect our business 

the nature of our business exposes us to the potential for various claims and litigation related to labor and employment personal injury property damage cargo claims safety and contract compliance environmental liability and other matters accordingly we are and in the future may be subject to legal proceedings and claims that have arisen in the ordinary course of our business and may include classaction allegations we are also subject to potential governmental proceedings inquiries and claims the parties in such actions may seek amounts from us that may not be covered in whole or in part by insurance defending ourselves against such actions could result in significant costs and could require a substantial amount of time and effort by our management team we cannot predict the outcome of litigation or governmental proceedings or inquiries to which we are a party or whether we will be subject to future legal actions as a result the potential costs associated with legal actions against us could adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations 

we are subject to various risks arising from our international business operations and relationships which could adversely affect our business 

we arrange for transportation and logistics services to and from various international locations and are subject to both the risks of conducting international business and the requirements of the foreign corrupt practices act of 1977 the fcpa failure to comply with the fcpa may result in legal claims against us in addition we face other risks associated with international operations and relationships which may include restrictive trade policies the renegotiation of international trade agreements imposition of duties taxes or government royalties imposed by foreign governments 

we are subject to legislative regulatory and legal developments involving taxes 

taxes are a significant part of our expenses we are subject to us federal and state income payroll property sales and use fuel and other types of taxes new or revised tax laws or regulations such as those included in the recently enacted tax cuts and jobs act the tax act higher tax rates claims audits investigations or legal proceedings involving taxing authorities could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

our results of operations may be affected by seasonal factors harsh weather conditions and disasters 

our operations are subject to seasonal trends common in our industry our revenue and operating margins in the first and fourth quarters are typically lower than those during the second and third quarters due to reduced shipments during the winter months harsh winter weather or natural disasters such as hurricanes tornadoes and floods can also adversely impact our performance by reducing demand and reducing our ability to transport freight which could result in decreased revenue and increased operating expenses 

if we are unable to retain our key employees or if we do not effectively execute our succession plan our financial condition results of operations and liquidity could be adversely affected 

our success will continue to depend upon the experience and leadership of our key employees and executive officers in that regard the loss of the services of any of our key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and liquidity if we are unable to secure replacement personnel who have sufficient experience in our industry and in the management of our business if we are unable to continue to develop and retain a core group of management personnel and execute succession planning strategies or we encounter any unforeseen difficulties associated with the recent transition of members of our management team our business could be negatively impacted in the future 

our principal shareholders control a large portion of our outstanding common stock 

earl e congdon david s congdon john r congdon jr and their affiliate family members beneficially own an aggregate of approximately 20 of the outstanding shares of our common stock as long as the congdon family controls a large portion of our voting stock they may be able to significantly influence the election of the entire board of directors and the outcome of all matters involving a shareholder vote the congdon family’s interests may differ from the interests of other shareholders and the status of their ownership could change at their discretion 

our financial results may be adversely impacted by potential future changes in accounting practices 

future changes in accounting standards or practices and related legal and regulatory interpretations of those changes may adversely impact public companies in general the transportation industry or our operations specifically new accounting standards or requirements could change the way we record revenues expenses assets andor liabilities or could be costly to implement these types of regulations could have a negative impact on our financial position liquidity results of operations andor access to capital 

our information technology systems are subject to cyber and other risks some of which are beyond our control which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial position 

we are reliant on the proper functioning and availability of our information systems for our operations as well as providing a valueadded service to our customers our information systems including our accounting communications and data processing systems are integral to the efficient operation of our business it is critical that the data processed by these systems remain confidential as it often includes competitive customer information confidential customer credit card and transaction data employee records and key financial and operational results and statistics cyber incidents that impact the security availability reliability speed accuracy or other proper functioning of these systems and measures including outages computer viruses breakins and similar disruptions could have a significant impact on our operations we utilize thirdparty service providers who have access to our systems and certain sensitive data which exposes us to additional security risks although our information systems are protected through physical and software safeguards as well as redundant systems network security measures and backup systems it is difficult to fully protect against the possibility of power loss telecommunications failures cyber attacks and other cyber incidents in every potential circumstance that may arise a significant cyber incident including system failure security breach disruption by malware or other damage could interrupt or delay our operations damage our reputation cause a loss of customers expose us to a risk of loss or litigation andor cause us to incur significant time and expense to remedy such an event any of which could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial position 

failure to keep pace with developments in technology any disruption to our technology infrastructure or failures of essential services upon which our technology platforms rely could cause us to incur costs or result in a loss of business which may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

we rely heavily on information technology systems our information technology systems are complex and require ongoing investments and enhancements to meet both internal requirements and the requirements of our customers if we are unable to invest in and enhance or modernize our technology systems in a timely manner or at a reasonable cost or if we are unable to train our employees to operate the new enhanced or modernized systems our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected we also may not achieve the benefits that we anticipate from any new technology or new or modernized system and a failure to do so could result in higher than anticipated costs or adversely affect our results of operations 

our information technology systems also depend upon the internet thirdparty service providers global communications providers satellitebased communications systems the electric utilities grid electric utility providers and telecommunications providers we have minimal control over the operation quality or maintenance of these services or whether vendors will improve their services or continue to provide services that are essential to our business disruptions due to transitional challenges in upgrading or enhancing our technology systems failures in the services upon which our information technology platforms rely including those that may arise from adverse weather conditions or natural calamities such as floods hurricanes earthquakes or tornadoes illegal acts including terrorist attacks human error or systems modernization initiatives andor other disruptions may adversely affect our business which could increase our costs or result in a loss of customers that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position 

damage to our reputation through unfavorable publicity could adversely affect our financial condition 

in the current environment of instantaneous communication and social media outlets the quick and broad dissemination of information through media sources could cause damaging information about us whether accurate or not to be broadly publicized unfavorable publicity about us or our employees could damage our reputation and may result in a reduction in demand for our services or the loss of customers that could have a negative impact on our financial condition results of operations and liquidity this unfavorable publicity could also require the need to allocate significant resources to the rebuilding of our reputation 

antiterrorism measures and terrorist events may disrupt our business 

federal state and municipal authorities have implemented and are continuing to implement various antiterrorism measures including checkpoints and travel restrictions on large trucks if additional security measures disrupt or impede the timing of our deliveries we may fail to meet the requirements of our customers or incur increased expenses to do so there can be no assurance that new antiterrorism measures will not be implemented and that such measures will not have a material adverse effect on our operations 

a decrease in the demand and value of used equipment may impact our results of operations 

as we purchase new tractors and trailers as part of our normal replacement cycle each year we rely on the used equipment market to dispose of our older equipment oversupply in the transportation industry as well as adverse domestic and foreign economic conditions can negatively impact the demand for used equipment and therefore reduce the value we can obtain on our used equipment if we are unable to sell our older equipment at or above our salvage value the resulting losses could have a significant impact on our results of operations 

if we raise additional capital in the future your ownership in us could be diluted 

any issuance of equity we may undertake in the future to raise additional capital could cause the price of our common stock to decline or require us to issue shares at a price that is lower than that paid by holders of our common stock in the past which would result in those newly issued shares being dilutive if we obtain funds through a credit facility or through the issuance of debt or preferred securities these obligations and securities would likely have rights senior to your rights as a common shareholder which could impair the value of our common stock 

there can be no assurance of our ability to declare and pay cash dividends in future periods 

we intend to pay a quarterly cash dividend to holders of our common stock for the foreseeable future however dividend payments are subject to approval by our board of directors and are restricted by applicable state law limitations on distributions to shareholders as well as certain covenants under our revolving credit facility as a result future dividend payments are not guaranteed and will depend upon various factors such as our overall financial condition available liquidity anticipated cash needs future prospects for earnings and cash flows as well as other factors considered relevant by our board of directors in addition any reduction or suspension in our dividend payments could adversely affect the price of our common stock 

the market value of our common stock may fluctuate and could be substantially affected by various factors 

the price of our common stock on the nasdaq global select market changes constantly we expect that the market price of our common stock will continue to fluctuate due to a variety of factors many of which are beyond our control these factors include among others 

 

our common stock price may fluctuate significantly in the future and these fluctuations may be unrelated to our performance general market price declines or market volatility in the future could adversely affect the price of our common stock and the current market price of our common stock may not be indicative of future market prices 

our articles of incorporation our bylaws and virginia law contain provisions that could discourage delay or prevent a change in our control or our management 

provisions of our articles of incorporation bylaws and the laws of virginia the state in which we are incorporated may discourage delay or prevent a change in control of us or a change in management that shareholders may consider favorable these provisions

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

overview 

we are a leading lessthantruckload “ltl” unionfree motor carrier providing regional interregional and national ltl services which include ground and air expedited transportation and consumer household pickup and delivery through a single integrated organization in addition to our core ltl services we offer a range of valueadded services including container drayage truckload brokerage supply chain consulting and warehousing more than 97 of our revenue has historically been derived from transporting ltl shipments for our customers whose demand for our services is generally tied to industrial production and the overall health of the us domestic economy 

in analyzing the components of our revenue we monitor changes and trends in our ltl services using the following key metrics which exclude certain transportation and logistics services where pricing is generally not determined by weight commodity or distance 

 

revenue per hundredweight is a commonlyused indicator of pricing trends but this metric can be influenced by many other factors such as changes in fuel surcharges weight per shipment length of haul and the class or mix of our freight as a result changes in revenue per hundredweight do not necessarily indicate actual changes in underlying base rates 

   

 

our primary revenue focus is to increase density which is shipment and tonnage growth within our existing infrastructure increases in density allow us to maximize our asset utilization and labor productivity which we measure over many different functional areas of our operations including linehaul load factor pickup and delivery “pd” stops per hour pd shipments per hour platform pounds handled per hour and platform shipments per hour in addition to our focus on density and operating efficiencies it is critical for us to obtain an appropriate yield which is measured as revenue per hundredweight on the shipments we handle we are committed to a disciplined yield management process that focuses on individual account profitability we believe yield management and improvements in efficiency are key components in our ability to produce profitable growth 

our primary cost elements are direct wages and benefits associated with the movement of freight operating supplies and expenses which include diesel fuel and depreciation of our equipment fleet and service center facilities we gauge our overall 

success in managing costs by monitoring our operating ratio a measure of profitability calculated by dividing total operating expenses by revenue which also allows for industrywide comparisons with our competition 

we continually upgrade our technological capabilities to improve our customer service and lower our operating costs our technology provides our customers with visibility of their shipments throughout our network increases the productivity of our workforce and provides key metrics that we use to monitor and enhance our processes 

results of operations 

the following table sets forth for the years indicated expenses and other items as a percentage of revenue from operations 



  

   

our financial results for 2017 reflect company record increases in revenue net income and earnings per diluted share we believe our results were driven by the strengthening economy and a favorable pricing environment during a period of tightening industry capacity our consistent investments in our service center network and equipment have provided us with the capacity needed to serve our customers’ increasing freight demands and win market share the increased freight density in our service center network and improvement in yield combined with our continued focus on managing our variable costs led to the 110 basispoint improvement in our operating ratio as compared to 2016 in addition to the increase in operating income our net income also increased due in part to net tax benefits recognized in connection with the enactment of the tax act in december 2017 as a result our net income and earnings per diluted share increased 568 and 581 respectively in 2017 as compared to 2016 

2017  compared to 2016   

key financial and operating metrics for 2017  and 2016  are presented below 



revenue 

revenue increased 3666 million or 123 as compared to 2016 due to a 3640 million increase in ltl revenue and a 26 million increase in nonltl revenue ltl revenue was higher in 2017 due to increases in both ltl tons and yield the 74 increase in ltl tons during 2017 resulted from a 58 increase in ltl shipments and a 15 increase in ltl weight per shipment as compared to 2016 we believe our tonnage growth in 2017 was driven by a stronger economic environment and market share gains resulting from increased demand for the consistent levels of premium service that we provide to our customers 

ltl revenue per hundredweight increased 48 to 1939 in 2017 as compared to 2016 despite the downward pressure on this metric created by the increase in our ltl weight per shipment and the decline in our average length of haul we believe this increase in our ltl revenue per hundredweight reflects our continued focus on yield management which benefited from a favorable pricing environment our ltl revenue and yield were also positively impacted by an increase in fuel surcharges in 2017 as compared to 2016 excluding fuel surcharges ltl revenue per hundredweight increased 29 in 2017 as compared to 2016 

most of our tariffs and contracts provide for a fuel surcharge that is generally indexed to the does published diesel fuel prices that reset each week our fuel surcharges are designed to offset fluctuations in the cost of petroleumbased products and are one of the many components included in the overall negotiated price we charge for our services as a percent of revenue fuel surcharges increased to 111 in 2017 from 95 in 2016 this increase was due primarily to an increase in the average price per gallon for diesel fuel during 2017 as compared to 2016 we regularly monitor the components of our pricing including base freight rates and fuel surcharges we also address any individual account profitability issues with our customers as part of our effort to minimize the negative impact on our profitability that would likely result from a rapid and significant change in any of our operating expenses 

operating costs and other expenses 

salaries wages and benefits increased 1504 million or 91 in 2017 due to a 1223 million increase in salaries and wages and a 281 million increase in benefit costs the increase in the costs attributable to salaries and wages was due primarily to the 30 increase in the average number of fulltime employees in 2017 annual wage increases provided to our employees in september 2016 and 2017 and higher performancebased compensation linked to our operating results in addition we paid a special bonus to all nonexecutive employees in december 2017 following passage of the tax act that totaled 98 million although our costs increased our aggregate productive labor costs as a percent of revenue decreased to 283 for 2017 from 289 for 2016 and our other indirect salaries and wages as a percent of revenue decreased to 120 for 2017 from 122 for 2016 

employee benefit costs increased 281 million or 67 due primarily to an increase in our average number of fulltime employees and higher wage rates which led to higher payrollrelated taxes and paidtimeoff benefits our employee benefit costs also increased for certain retirement benefit plans directly linked to the improvement in our net income and the share price of our common stock our group health costs and workers compensation expenses decreased as a percent of salaries and wages which contributed to the overall improvement in total employee benefit costs as a percent of salaries and wages to 332 for 2017 from 342 for 2016 

operating supplies and expenses increased 588 million or 182 in 2017 as compared to 2016 due primarily to increased costs of diesel fuel the cost of diesel fuel excluding fuel taxes represents the largest component of operating supplies and expenses and can vary based on both average price per gallon and consumption the increase in our diesel fuel costs excluding fuel taxes was due primarily to a 235 increase in our average cost per gallon of diesel fuel during 2017 in addition our gallons consumed increased 43 in 2017 as compared to 2016 due primarily to a 45 increase in linehaul and pd miles driven we do not use diesel fuel hedging instruments and our costs are therefore subject to market price fluctuations 

general supplies and expenses increased 211 million or 244 in 2017 as compared to 2016 the increase was due primarily to an increase in our advertising and marketing costs and higher costs for technology and related support 

depreciation and amortization increased 159 million or 84 due primarily to the assets acquired as part of our 2016 and 2017 capital expenditure programs these costs however were relatively consistent as a percent of revenue between the periods compared we believe depreciation will continue to increase based on our 2018 capital expenditure plan while our investments in real estate equipment and technology can increase our costs in the shortterm we believe these investments are necessary to support our continued growth and strategic initiatives 

our effective tax rate in 2017 was 195 as compared to 381 in 2016 our provision for income taxes in 2017 includes a 1049 million income tax benefit resulting from the revaluation of our deferred tax liabilities in connection with the passage of the tax act in december 2017 in addition our effective tax rates for 2017 and 2016 were favorably impacted by various tax credits our effective tax rate generally exceeds the federal statutory rate due to the impact of state taxes and to a lesser extent certain other nondeductible items we expect our effective tax rate to decrease for 2018 to approximately 26  27 as a result of the tax act our estimated tax rate could be impacted by future tax adjustments that may be necessary to comply with clarifying interpretations and guidance related to the tax act 

2016  compared to 2015   

key financial and operating metrics for 2016  and 2015  are presented below 



revenue 

our revenue in 2016 increased 191 million or 06 as compared to 2015 due to a 459 million increase in ltl revenue partially offset by a 268 million reduction in nonltl revenue ltl revenue was higher in 2016 as a result of an increase in ltl revenue per hundredweight that was negatively impacted by a slight decline in ltl tonnage the reduction in 

nonltl revenue was primarily due to strategic changes in our container drayage and international freight forwarding service offerings that we initiated in the second half of 2015 

ltl revenue per hundredweight increased 15 to 1851 in 2016 primarily due to our disciplined yield management process and a generally stable pricing environment the increase in ltl revenue per hundredweight was negatively impacted by a decline in our fuel surcharges that reflected lower average diesel fuel prices excluding fuel surcharges ltl revenue per hundredweight increased 26 in 2016 as compared to 2015 

most of our tariffs and contracts provide for a fuel surcharge that is generally indexed to the does published diesel fuel prices that reset each week our fuel surcharges are designed to offset fluctuations in the cost of petroleumbased products and are one of the many components included in the overall negotiated price we charge for our services fuel surcharge revenue decreased to 95 of revenue in 2016 from 104 in 2015 primarily due to a decrease in the average price per gallon for diesel fuel for those comparative periods we regularly monitor the components of our pricing including base freight rates and fuel surcharges and our costs at the customer level we address individual customer profitability issues to minimize the negative impact on our profitability that would likely result from a rapid and significant change in any of our operating expenses

salaries wages and benefits increased 823 million or 52 in 2016 due to a 471 million increase in salaries and wages and a 352 million increase in benefit costs the increase in salaries and wages excluding benefits was due primarily to the impact of the annual wage increases provided to employees in september 2015 and 2016 and an increase in our direct labor costs to support our strategic reduction in purchased transportation we implemented certain operational initiatives in the second half of 2015 to decrease our reliance on purchased transportation providers but these changes increased our utilization of company employees and equipment these increases were partially offset by lower performancebased compensation linked to operating results as well as improvements in productivity platform pounds and platform shipments per hour improved 40 and 38 respectively in 2016 as compared to 2015 both pd stops and pd shipments per hour remained consistent between the periods compared while our linehaul laden load average declined 17 as compared to 2015 our aggregate productive labor costs increased to 289 of revenue in 2016 as compared to 279 in 2015 while our other indirect salaries and wages increased to 122 of revenue in 2016 as compared to 119 in 2015 

employee benefit costs increased 352 million or 91 in 2016 compared to 2015 primarily due to higher costs for our group health and dental plans and an increase in certain retirement benefit plan costs that are directly linked to the market price of our common stock our group health and dental costs were higher in 2016 primarily due to a 58 increase in the average cost per covered employee as compared to 2015 as a result our employee benefit costs increased to 342 of salaries and wages in 2016 as compared to 326 in 2015 

operating supplies and expenses decreased 309 million in 2016 as compared to 2015 these costs as a percent of revenue improved to 108 of revenue in 2016 from 119 of revenue in 2015 primarily due to a reduction in fuel costs the cost of diesel fuel excluding fuel taxes represents the largest component of operating supplies and expenses and can vary based on both average price per gallon and consumption the decrease in our diesel fuel costs excluding fuel taxes during 2016 was due primarily to a 134 decline in our average cost per gallon while our fuel consumption remained relatively consistent between the periods compared despite the increase in miles driven our fuel consumption benefited from an overall improvement in miles per gallon which continues to improve as we add newer more fuelefficient equipment to our operations we do not use diesel fuel hedging instruments and are therefore subject to market price fluctuations other operating supplies and expenses excluding diesel fuel remained relatively consistent as a percent of revenue between the periods compared 

depreciation and amortization increased 245 million due primarily to the assets acquired as part of our 2015 and 2016 capital expenditure programs as a percent of revenue our depreciation and amortization expense increased to 63 in 2016 compared to 56 in 2015 we believe depreciation will continue to increase based on our 2017 capital expenditure plan while our investments in real estate equipment and technology can increase our costs in the shortterm we believe these investments are necessary to support our continued growth and strategic initiatives 

purchased transportation decreased 422 million or 363 in 2016 as compared to 2015 the decrease was due primarily to the strategic elimination of certain services in the second quarter of 2015 that reduced our use of thirdparty providers for the remainder of 2015 and throughout 2016 we continue to utilize purchased transportation services when beneficial to support our ltl services and other nonltl services including our container drayage and truckload brokerage services 

our effective tax rate in 2016 was 381 as compared to 378 in 2015 our effective tax rates in 2016 and 2015 were favorably impacted by various tax credits our effective tax rate generally exceeds the federal statutory rate of 35 due to the impact of state taxes and to a lesser extent certain other nondeductible items 

liquidity and capital resources 

a summary of our cash flows is presented below 



the change in our cash flows provided by operating activities during 2017 was impacted by an increase in income before income taxes of 982 million and an increase in depreciation and amortization of 159 million these increases were more than offset by an increase in income taxes paid of 760 million and other fluctuations in certain working capital accounts 

the change in our cash flows provided by operating activities during 2016 was impacted by an increase in depreciation and amortization of 245 million as compared to 2015 this increase was partially offset by an 89 million decrease in net income as well as other fluctuations in certain working capital accounts 

the changes in cash flows used in investing activities for all periods were due to the timing of equipment purchases under our capital expenditure plans changes in our capital expenditures are more fully described below in “capital expenditures” 

the changes in cash flows used in financing activities for all periods were due primarily to fluctuations in capital returned to shareholders and fluctuations in our longterm debt which includes our senior unsecured revolving line of credit our financing arrangements are more fully described below under financing agreements our return of capital to shareholders is more fully described below under stock repurchase program and dividends to shareholders respectively 

we have three primary sources of available liquidity cash and cash equivalents cash flows from operations and available borrowings under our senior unsecured revolving credit agreement which is described below we believe we also have sufficient access to debt and equity markets to provide other sources of liquidity if needed 

capital expenditures 

the table below sets forth our net capital expenditures for property and equipment including those obtained through capital leases for the years ended december 31 2017  2016  and 2015  



our capital expenditures varied based upon the projected increase in the number and size of our service center facilities to support our plan for longterm growth our planned tractor and trailer replacement cycle and forecasted tonnage and shipment growth expenditures for land and structures can be dependent upon the availability of land in the geographic areas where we are looking to expand we expect to continue to maintain a high level of capital expenditures in order to support our longterm plan for market share growth 

we currently estimate capital expenditures will be approximately 510 million for the year ending december 31 2018  approximately 200 million is allocated for the purchase of service center facilities construction of new service center facilities or expansion of existing service center facilities subject to the availability of suitable real estate and the timing of construction projects approximately 265 million is allocated for the purchase of tractors and trailers and approximately 45 million is allocated for investments in technology and other assets we expect to fund these capital expenditures primarily through cash flows from operations our existing cash and cash equivalents and the use of our senior unsecured revolving credit facility we believe our current sources of liquidity will be sufficient to satisfy our expected capital expenditures 

stock repurchase program 

during the second quarter of 2016 we completed our stock repurchase program previously announced on november 10 2014 to repurchase up to an aggregate of 2000 million  of our outstanding common stock on may 23 2016 we announced that our board of directors had approved a new twoyear stock repurchase program authorizing us to repurchase up to an aggregate of 2500 million  of our outstanding common stock the “2016 repurchase program” under the 2016 repurchase program we may repurchase shares from time to time in open market purchases or through privately negotiated transactions shares of our common stock repurchased under our repurchase program are canceled at the time of repurchase and are classified as authorized but unissued shares of our common stock 

during the years ended december 31 2017  2016  and 2015  we repurchased 91921 2062841 and 1682419 shares of our common stock under our repurchase programs for an aggregate of 80 million 1303 million and 1141 million respectively as of december 31 2017  we had 1920 million remaining authorized under the 2016 repurchase program 

dividends to shareholders 

our board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of 010 per share in each quarter of fiscal year 2017 we did not declare or pay any dividends on our common stock during fiscal years 2016  or 2015 

  

on february 8 2018 we announced that our board of directors had declared a cash dividend of 013 per share of our common stock the dividend is payable on march 20 2018 to shareholders of record at the close of business on march 6 2018 although we intend to pay a quarterly cash dividend on our common stock for the foreseeable future the declaration of any future dividend is subject to approval by our board of directors and is restricted by applicable state law limitations on distributions to shareholders as well as certain covenants under our revolving credit facility we anticipate that any future quarterly cash dividends will be funded through cash flows from operations and if needed borrowings under our revolving credit facility 

financing agreements 

we had one unsecured senior note agreement with an amount outstanding of 950 million  at each of december 31 2017  and 2016  our unsecured senior note agreement calls for two scheduled principal payments of 500 million  and 450 million  on january 3 2018 and january 3 2021 respectively interest rates on the january 3 2018 and january 3 2021 scheduled principal payments were 400  and 479  respectively the effective average interest rate on our outstanding senior note agreement was 437  at each of december 31 2017  and 2016  the company made the required 500 million principal payment on january 3 2018 

on december 15 2015 we entered into an amended and restated credit agreement with wells fargo bank national association wells fargo serving as administrative agent for the lenders the credit agreement the credit agreement originally provided for a fiveyear 2500 million  senior unsecured revolving line of credit and a 1000 million  accordion feature which if exercised and approved would expand the total borrowing capacity up to an aggregate of 3500 million  

on september 9 2016 we exercised a portion of the accordion feature and entered into an amendment to the credit agreement to increase the aggregate commitments from existing lenders by 500 million  to an aggregate of 3000 million  of the 3000 million  line of credit commitments under the credit agreement as amended up to 1000 million  may be used for letters of credit and 300 million  may be used for borrowings under the wells fargo sweep plus loan program the sweep program we utilize the sweep program to manage our daily cash needs as it automatically initiates borrowings to cover overnight cash requirements primarily for working capital needs 

at our option borrowings under the credit agreement bear interest at either i libor plus an applicable margin based on our ratio of net debttototal capitalization that ranges from 10  to 150  or ii a base rate plus an applicable margin 

based on our ratio of net debttototal capitalization that ranges from 00  to 05  loans under the sweep program bear interest at libor plus applicable margin rate letter of credit fees equal to the applicable margin for libor loans are charged quarterly in arrears on the daily average aggregate stated amount of all letters of credit outstanding during the quarter commitment fees ranging from 0125  to 02  based upon the ratio of net debttototal capitalization are charged quarterly in arrears on the aggregate unutilized portion of the credit agreement wells fargo as administrative agent also receives an annual fee for providing administrative services 

for periods covered under the credit agreement the applicable margin on libor loans and letter of credit fees were 10  and commitment fees were 0125  

the amounts outstanding and remaining borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facilities are presented below 



with the exception of borrowings pursuant to the credit agreement interest rates are fixed on all of our debt instruments therefore shortterm exposure to fluctuations in interest rates related to our debt instruments is limited to our line of credit facility we do not currently use interest rate derivative instruments to manage exposure to interest rate changes 

our senior note agreement and credit agreement contain customary covenants including financial covenants that require us to observe a maximum ratio of debt to total capital and a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio any future whollyowned material domestic subsidiaries of the company would be required to guarantee payment of all of our obligations under these agreements the credit agreement also includes a provision limiting our ability to make restricted payments including dividends and payments for share repurchases unless among other conditions no defaults or events of default are ongoing or would be caused by such restricted payment we were in compliance with all covenants in our outstanding debt instruments for the period ended december 31 2017  

a significant decrease in demand for our services could limit our ability to generate cash flow and could also affect our profitability most of our debt agreements have covenants that require stated levels of financial performance which if not achieved could cause acceleration of the payment schedules as of december 31 2017  we were in compliance with these covenants we do not anticipate a significant decline in business levels or financial performance that would cause us to violate any such covenants in the future and we believe the combination of our existing credit agreement along with our additional borrowing capacity will be sufficient to meet foreseeable seasonal and longterm capital needs 

contractual obligations 

the following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations as of december 31 2017  



  

 

critical accounting policies 

in preparing our financial statements we apply the following critical accounting policies that we believe affect our judgments and estimates of amounts recorded in certain assets liabilities revenue and expenses these critical accounting policies are further described in note 1 of the notes to the financial statements included in item 8 of this report 

revenue recognition 

we recognize revenue based upon when our transportation services have been completed in accordance with the bill of lading contract our general tariff provisions or contractual agreements with our customers generally this occurs when we complete the delivery of a shipment for transportation services not completed at the end of a reporting period we use a percentage of completion method to allocate the appropriate revenue to each separate reporting period under this method we develop a factor for each uncompleted shipment by dividing the actual number of days in transit at the end of a reporting period by that shipment’s standard delivery time schedule this factor is applied to the total revenue for that shipment and revenue is allocated between reporting periods accordingly 

allowances for uncollectible accounts and revenue adjustments 

we maintain an allowance for uncollectible accounts for estimated losses resulting from the failure of our customers to make required payments we estimate this allowance by analyzing the aging of our customer receivables our historical loss experience and other trends and factors affecting the credit risk of our customers we determine customer receivables to be past due when payment has not been received by the invoice due date writeoffs occur when we determine an account to be uncollectible and could differ from our allowance estimate as a result of factors such as changes in the overall economic environment or risks surrounding our customers additional allowances may be required if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments we periodically review the underlying assumptions in our estimate of the allowance for uncollectible accounts to ensure that the allowance reflects the most recent trends and factors 

we also maintain an allowance for estimated revenue adjustments resulting from future billing corrections customer allowances moneyback service guarantees and other miscellaneous revenue adjustments these revenue adjustments are recorded in our revenue from operations we use historical experience trends and current information to update and evaluate these estimates 

claims and insurance accruals 

claims and insurance accruals reflect the estimated cost of claims not covered by insurance for cargo loss and damage bipd workers’ compensation group health and dental the related costs are charged to insurance and claims expense except for workers’ compensation group health and dental which are charged to employee benefits expense 

insurers providing excess coverage above a companys sir or deductible levels typically adjust their premiums to cover insured losses and for other market factors as a result we periodically evaluate our sir and deductible levels to determine the most costefficient balance between our exposure and excess coverage 

in establishing accruals for claims and expenses we evaluate and monitor each claim individually and we use factors such as historical claims development experience known trends and thirdparty estimates to determine the appropriate reserves for potential liability we believe the assumptions and methods used to estimate these liabilities are reasonable however any changes in the severity of previouslyreported claims significant changes in medical costs and regulatory changes affecting the administration of our plans could significantly impact the determination of appropriate reserves in future periods 

property and equipment 

property and equipment are recorded at cost and depreciated on a straightline basis over their estimated economic lives we use historical experience certain assumptions and estimates in determining the economic life of each asset when indicators of impairment exist we review property and equipment for impairment due to changes in operational and market conditions and we adjust the carrying value and economic life of any impaired asset as appropriate 

estimated economic lives for structures are 7 to 30 years revenue equipment is 4 to 15 years other equipment is 2 to 20 years and leasehold improvements are the lesser of the economic life of the leasehold improvement or the remaining life of the 

lease the use of different assumptions estimates or significant changes in the resale market for our equipment could result in material changes in the carrying value and related depreciation of our assets 

inflation 

most of our expenses are affected by inflation which typically results in increased operating costs in response to fluctuations in the cost of petroleum products particularly diesel fuel we generally include a fuel surcharge in our tariffs and contractual agreements the fuel surcharge is designed to offset the cost of diesel fuel above a base price and fluctuates as diesel fuel prices change from the base which is generally indexed to the doe’s published fuel prices that reset each week volatility in the price of diesel fuel independent of inflation has impacted our business as described in this report however we do not believe inflation has had a material effect on our results of operations for any of the past three years 

related party transactions 

family relationships 

each of earl e congdon david s congdon and john r congdon jr are related to one another and served in various management positions andor on our board of directors during 2017  our employment agreements with earl e congdon and david s congdon are incorporated by reference as exhibits to this annual report on form 10k we regularly disclose the amount of compensation that we pay to these individuals as well as the compensation paid to any of their family members employed by us that from time to time may require disclosure in the proxy statement for our annual meeting of shareholders 

transactions with old dominion truck leasing inc 

from time to time we have utilized the services of old dominion truck leasing inc “leasing” leased property to leasing and collaborated with leasing for the purchase of certain equipment and fuel leasing which historically had been primarily engaged in the business of leasing tractors trailers and other vehicles as well as providing contract dedicated fleet services was acquired by penske truck leasing during the third quarter of 2017 the “penske acquisition” prior to the penske acquisition john r congdon jr served as leasing’s chairman of the board and ceo and earl e congdon and david s congdon each served on leasing’s board of directors 

our business relationships with leasing as well as the positions held at leasing by john r congdon jr earl e congdon and david s congdon ceased in the third quarter of 2017 in connection with the penske acquisition prior to the penske acquisition we purchased 110000  254000  and 313000  of maintenance and other services from leasing in 2017  2016  and 2015  respectively in addition we received 6000  12000  and 12000  from leasing for the rental of property in 2017  2016  and 2015  respectively 

audit committee approval 

the audit committee of our board of directors reviewed and approved all of the related person transactions described above in accordance with our related person transactions policy 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact our financial position results of operations and cash flows due to adverse changes in financial market prices and rates 

we are exposed to interest rate risk directly related to loans if any under our credit agreement which have variable interest rates a 100 basis point increase in the average interest rate on this agreement would have no material effect on our operating results we have established policies and procedures to manage exposure to market risks and use major institutions that we believe are creditworthy to minimize credit risk 

we are exposed to market risk for equity investments relating to companyowned life insurance contracts on certain employees at december 31 2017  the cash value for variable life insurance contracts was 509 million of the 531 million of aggregate cash values for all life insurance contracts included on our balance sheets variable life insurance contracts expose us to fluctuations in equity markets however we utilize a thirdparty to manage these assets and minimize that exposure a 10 change in market value in those investments would have had a 51 million impact on our pretax income in 2017 

we are exposed to market risk for awards previously granted under our employee and director phantom stock plans the liability for the unsettled outstanding awards is remeasured at the end of each reporting period based on the price of our common stock at december 31 2017  the total liability for unsettled awards granted under these phantom stock plans totaled 566 million  a 10 change in the price of our common stock at december 31 2017  would have had a 57 million impact on our operating income in 2017  with respect to these plans 

we are also exposed to commodity price risk related to diesel fuel prices and we manage our exposure to that risk primarily through the application of fuel surcharges to our customers 

for further discussion related to these risks see notes 2 and 8 of the notes to the financial statements included in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” and item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations”

unless the context requires otherwise references in this report to “old dominion” the “company” “we” “us” and “our” refer to old dominion freight line inc 

overview 

we are a leading unionfree motor carrier providing regional interregional and national lessthantruckload “ltl” services through a single integrated organization our ltl services include ground and air expedited transportation for timesensitive shipments consumer household pickup and delivery and freight delivery services throughout north america in addition to our core ltl services we offer a range of other valueadded services that include container drayage truckload brokerage supply chain consulting and warehousing more than 97 of our revenue has historically been derived from transporting ltl shipments for our customers whose demand for our services is generally tied to industrial production and the overall health of the us domestic economy 

we have grown to the fourth largest ltl motor carrier in the united states as measured by 2015 revenue from the seventh largest ltl motor carrier in the united states as measured by 2010 revenue according to transport topics  we have increased our revenue and customer base over this fiveyear period primarily through organic market share growth our infrastructure allows us to provide nextday and secondday service through each of our regions covering the continental united states we opened 10 and 44 new service centers over the past five and ten years respectively for a total of 226  service centers at december 31 2016  we believe this expansion produced increased capacity within our service center network and provides us with opportunities for future growth 

we believe the growth in demand for our services can be attributed to our ability to consistently provide a superior level of customer service at a fair price which allows our customers to meet their supply chain needs our integrated structure allows us to offer our customers consistent highquality service from origin to destination and we believe our operating structure and proprietary information systems enable us to efficiently manage our operating costs our services are complemented by our technological capabilities which we believe provide the tools to improve the efficiency of our operations while also empowering our customers to manage their individual shipping needs 

we were founded in 1934 and incorporated in virginia in 1950 our principal executive offices are located at 500 old dominion way thomasville north carolina 27360 please refer to the balance sheets and statements of operations included in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” in this report for information regarding our total assets revenue from operations and net income 

our industry 

trucking companies provide transportation services to virtually every industry operating in the united states and generally offer higher levels of reliability and faster transit times than other surface transportation options the trucking industry is comprised principally of two types of motor carriers ltl and truckload ltl freight carriers typically pick up multiple shipments from multiple customers on a single truck the ltl freight is then routed through a network of service centers where the freight may be transferred to other trucks with similar destinations ltl motor carriers generally require a more expansive network of local pickup and delivery “pd” service centers as well as larger breakbulk or hub facilities in contrast truckload carriers generally dedicate an entire truck to one customer from origin to destination 

significant capital is required to create and maintain a network of service centers and a fleet of tractors and trailers the high fixed costs and capital spending requirements for ltl motor carriers make it difficult for new startup or small operators to effectively compete with established carriers in addition successful ltl motor carriers generally employ and regularly update a high level of technologybased systems and processes that provide information to customers and help reduce operating costs 

according to the american trucking associations the trucking industry accounted for 812 of the 8946 billion total us transportation revenue in 2015 the ltl sector had revenue in 2015 of 563 billion which represented 63 of total us transportation revenue the ltl industry is highly competitive on the basis of service and price and has consolidated significantly since the industry was deregulated in 1980 based on 2015 revenue as reported in transport topics  the largest 10 and 25 ltl motor carriers accounted for approximately 50 and 60 respectively of the total ltl market we believe consolidation in our industry will continue due to customer demand for transportation providers offering both national and regional ltl as well as other complementary valueadded services 

competition 

the transportation and logistics industry is intensely competitive and highly fragmented we compete with regional interregional and national ltl carriers and to a lesser extent with truckload carriers small package carriers airfreight carriers and railroads we also compete with and provide transportation services to thirdparty logistics providers that determine both the mode of transportation and the carrier some of our competitors may have a broader global network and a wider range of services than we do competition in our industry is based primarily on service price available capacity and business relationships we believe we are able to gain market share by expanding our capacity and providing highquality service at a fair price 

throughout our organization we continuously seek to improve customer service by maximizing ontime performance and minimizing cargo claims we believe our transit times are generally faster and more reliable than those of our principal national competitors in part because of our more efficient service center network use of team drivers and proprietary technology in addition we provide greater geographic coverage than most of our regional competitors our diversified mix and scope of regional interregional and national ltl service combined with our valueadded service offerings enables us to provide our customers with a single source to meet their shipping and logistics needs we believe the combination of these factors provide us with a distinct advantage over most of our competitors 

we utilize flexible scheduling and train our employees to perform multiple tasks which we believe allows us to achieve greater productivity and higher levels of customer service than our competitors we believe our focus on employee communication continued education development and motivation strengthens the relationships and trust among our employees

at december 31 2016  we operated 226  service center locations of which we owned 182  and leased 44  our network includes ten major breakbulk facilities located in rialto california atlanta georgia columbus ohio indianapolis indiana greensboro north carolina harrisburg pennsylvania memphis and morristown tennessee dallas texas and salt lake city utah while using various other service centers for additional limited breakbulk activity in order to serve our nextday markets our service centers are strategically located throughout the country so that we can provide the highest quality service and minimize freight rehandling costs 

our service centers are responsible for the pickup and delivery of freight within their local service area each night our service centers load outbound freight for transport to our other service centers for delivery all inbound freight received by the service center in the evening or during the night is generally scheduled for local delivery the next business day unless a 

customer requests a different delivery schedule our management reviews the productivity and service performance of each service center on a daily basis to ensure quality service and efficient operations 

although we have established primary responsibility for customer service at the local service center level our customers may access information and initiate transactions through our centralized customer service department located at our corporate office or through other electronic gateways our systems allow us to offer our customers access to information such as freight tracking shipping documents rate quotes rate databases and account activity these centralized systems and our customer service department provide our customers with a single point of contact to access information across all areas of our operations and for each of our service offerings 

linehaul transportation 

linehaul dispatchers control the movement of freight between service centers through integrated freight movement systems we also utilize loadplanning software to optimize efficiencies in our linehaul operations our management team monitors freight movements transit times load factors and many other productivity measurements to help ensure that we maintain our high levels of service and efficiency 

we utilize scheduled routes and additional linehaul dispatches as necessary to meet our published transit times in addition we gain efficiency through the use of twin 28foot trailers in our linehaul operations the use of twin 28foot trailers permits us to transport freight directly from its point of origin to destination with minimal unloading and reloading which also reduces cargo loss and damage expenses we utilize longcombination vehicles such as triple 28foot trailers and combinations of 48foot and 28foot trailers in states where permitted twin trailers and longcombination vehicles permit more freight to be transported behind a tractor than could otherwise be transported by one trailer 

tractors trailers and maintenance 

at december 31 2016  we owned 7994  tractors we generally use new tractors in linehaul operations for approximately three to five years and then transfer those tractors to pd operations for the remainder of their useful lives in many of our service centers tractors perform pd functions during the day and linehaul functions at night to maximize tractor utilization 

the table below reflects as of december 31 2016  the average age of our tractors and trailers 



we develop certain specifications for tractors and trailers and then negotiate the production and purchase of this equipment with several manufacturers these purchases are planned well in advance of anticipated delivery dates in order to accommodate manufacturers’ production schedules we believe there is sufficient capacity among suppliers to ensure an uninterrupted supply of equipment to support our operations 

the table below sets forth our capital expenditures for tractors and trailers for the years ended december 31 2016  2015  and 2014  for more information concerning our capital expenditures see item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations – liquidity and capital resources ” in this report 



at december 31 2016  we operated 39 maintenance centers at strategic service center locations throughout our network these maintenance centers are equipped to perform routine and preventive maintenance and repairs on our equipment 

we adhere to established maintenance policies and procedures to help ensure our fleet is properly maintained tractors are routed to appropriate maintenance facilities at designated mileage intervals or every 90 days whichever occurs first trailers are also scheduled for preventative maintenance every 90 days 

customers 

revenue is generated primarily from customers throughout the united states and north america in 2016  our largest customer accounted for approximately 30 of our revenue and our largest 5 10 and 20 customers accounted for 104 154 and 219 of our revenue respectively for each of the previous three years more than 95 of our revenue was derived from services performed in the united states and less than 5 of our revenue was generated from services performed internationally we believe the diversity of our customer base helps protect our business from adverse developments in a single geographic region and from the reduction or loss of business from a single customer 

we utilize an integrated freightcosting system to determine the price level at which a particular shipment of freight will be profitable we can modify elements of this freightcosting model to simulate the actual conditions under which the freight will be moved many of our customers engage our services through the terms and provisions of our tariffs and through negotiated service contracts we also compete for business by participating in bid solicitations customers generally solicit bids for relatively large numbers of shipments for a period of one to two years and typically choose to enter into contractual arrangements with a limited number of motor carriers based upon price and service 

seasonality 

our tonnage levels and revenue mix are subject to seasonal trends common in our industry although other factors such as macroeconomic changes could cause variation in these trends our revenue and operating margins in the first and fourth quarters are typically lower than those during the second and third quarters due to reduced shipments during the winter months harsh winter weather or natural disasters such as hurricanes tornadoes and floods can also adversely impact our performance by reducing demand and increasing operating expenses we believe seasonal trends will continue to impact our business 

technology 

our technology is critical to the success and delivery of the premium service provided by our operations we continually seek to upgrade and enhance our technological capabilities we also provide access to our systems through multiple gateways that offer our customers and employees maximum flexibility and immediate access to information we employ vehicle safety systems onboard and handheld computer systems freight handling systems and logistics technology to reduce costs and transit times our data systems are integrated at every level within our organization which we believe is critical to our success our systems are protected through physical and software safeguards as well as redundant systems network security measures and backup systems we continue to focus on the development and enhancement of the technology used in our operations in order to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of our services 

insurance 

we carry a significant amount of insurance with thirdparty insurance carriers but we are exposed to the risk of loss on claims up to the limit for which we hold either a selfinsured retention sir or deductible at december 31 2016  the amounts of our sir andor deductibles were as follows 

• 275 million per occurrence for bodily injury and property damage “bipd” claims plus a onetime 25 

million aggregate corridor deductible applicable to any claim that exceeds 50 million and occurs after 

march 30 2016 

• 100000 per occurrence for cargo loss and damage 

• 10 million per occurrence for workers’ compensation claims and 

• 800000 per covered person paid during 2016 for group health claims 

we believe that our policy of maintaining an sir or deductible for a portion of our risks supported by our safety and loss prevention programs is an effective means of managing insurance costs we periodically review our risk exposure and insurance coverage applicable to those risks and we believe that we maintain sufficient insurance coverage 

diesel fuel availability and cost 

we depend heavily upon the availability and quality of diesel fuel to provide our transportation services we maintain fuel storage and pumping facilities at certain service center locations as the primary source for fueling our fleet and we utilize overtheroad fueling options at retail locations as necessary we could be susceptible to regional andor national fuel shortages which could cause us to incur additional expense in order to obtain an adequate supply within our own fueling network or cause us to rely more heavily on higherpriced retail fuel 

we believe our operations and financial condition are susceptible to the same diesel fuel price increases or shortages as those of our competitors we implemented a fuel surcharge program in august 1999 which has remained in effect since that time and is one of many components that we use to determine the overall price for our transportation services our fuel surcharges are generally indexed to fuel prices published by the us department of energy the “doe” that reset each week 

employees 

as of december 31 2016  we employed 17543  individuals on a fulltime basis none of which were represented under a collective bargaining agreement our fulltime employees work in the following roles 



as of december 31 2016  we employed 4910 linehaul drivers and 4473 pd drivers on a fulltime basis we select our drivers primarily based upon safe driving records and experience among other requirements our drivers must pass a drug test have a current us department of transportation “dot” physical and have a valid commercial driver’s license prior to employment once employed drivers are required to obtain and maintain hazardous materials endorsements to their commercial driver’s licenses drivers like all of our employees are required to take preemployment drug and alcohol tests and are randomly selected for periodic additional testing 

since 1988 we have provided the opportunity for qualified employees to become drivers through the “old dominion driver training program” there are currently 2725 active drivers who have successfully completed this training which was approximately 29 of our driver workforce as of december 31 2016  we believe our driver training and qualification programs have been important factors in improving our safety record and retaining qualified drivers in addition we have experienced an annual turnover rate for our driver graduates of approximately 61 which is below our companywide turnover rate for all drivers of approximately 83 

we reward our drivers who maintain safe driving records with annual bonuses of up to 3000 per driver our safety bonuses paid to drivers totaled 37 million 34 million and 31 million in 2016  2015  and 2014  respectively 

governmental regulation 

we are regulated by the dot and by various state agencies these regulatory authorities have broad powers generally governing matters such as authority to engage in motor carrier operations as well as motor carrier registration driver hours of service safety and fitness of transportation equipment and drivers transportation of hazardous materials certain mergers and acquisitions and periodic financial reporting the trucking industry is also subject to regulatory and legislative changes from a variety of other governmental authorities which address matters such as increasingly stringent environmental regulations occupational safety and health regulations limits on vehicle weight and size ergonomics port security and hours of service 

in addition we are subject to compliance with cargosecurity and transportation regulations issued by the transportation security administration tsa and customs and border protection cbp within the us department of homeland security regulatory requirements and changes in regulatory requirements may affect our business or the economics of the industry by requiring changes in operating practices or by influencing the demand for and increasing the costs of providing transportation services 

driver hours of service 

in december 2011 the federal motor carrier safety administration the fmcsa issued revised rules governing hours of service for commercial truck drivers the 2011 rules and mandated compliance by july 1 2013 the 2011 rules reduced the maximum number of hours a truck driver could work each week to 70 hours from the former 82hour limit the 2011 rules maintained the maximum 11hour daily driving limit but required that drivers take a 30minute break prior to working beyond eight hours the 2011 rules also added restrictions to the “34hour restart” provision to include two rest periods between 1 am and 5 am and limited the use of the restart to once every 168 hours compliance with the 2011 rules on july 1 2013 required us to make certain changes in our operating procedures these changes increased our operating costs by limiting the productivity of our drivers 

in december 2014 the fmcsa temporarily suspended through the 2015 omnibus appropriations bill enforcement of the provisions requiring two rest periods between 1 am and 5 am and the 168hour minimum restart restriction the suspension of these provisions of the 2011 rules allowed us to improve our productivity and we continue to benefit from the suspension of these provisions 

in connection with the temporary suspension congress requested that the fmcsa conduct a study to determine whether two rest periods between 1 am and 5 am and the limited use of one restart every 168 hours significantly improved safety benefits in december 2016 congress enacted legislation providing that if the fmcsa study demonstrates significant safety benefits attributable to these two rest periods and the 168hour minimum restart restriction then these two restrictions to the “34hour restart” provision will be reinstated if the fmcsa’s study does not support the safety benefits the suspension will remain in effect the fmcsa has not yet released its study 

electronic logging devices 

in december 2015 the fmcsa issued final rules to mandate the use of electronic logging devices “elds” to automatically record driving time for hours of service reporting generally carriers must comply with these new requirements by december 2017 we currently utilize elds in all of our companyowned vehicles and do not believe this new requirement will have a significant impact on our operations 

commercial drivers license drug and alcohol clearinghouse 

in december 2016 the fmcsa released a final rule establishing the commercial driver’s license drug and alcohol clearinghouse dac the dac is a database that will maintain records of drug and alcohol violations of commercial motor vehicle drivers the dac will require us to check prospective employees for drug and alcohol violations and all current driver employees must be checked at least annually the intent of the clearinghouse is to ensure that drivers cannot conceal drug and alcohol violations by changing jobs or locations compliance with this rule which provides for a threeyear implementation period is required by january 6 2020 

we are subject to future rulemaking by the fmcsa and other regulatory agencies which could be more stringent require additional changes to our operations increase our operating costs or otherwise adversely impact our results of operations 

environmental regulation 

we are subject to various federal state and local environmental laws and regulations that focus on among other things the emission and discharge of hazardous materials into the environment or their presence at our properties or in our vehicles fuel storage tanks transportation of certain materials and the discharge or retention of storm water under specific environmental laws we could also be held responsible for any costs relating to contamination at our past or present facilities and at thirdparty waste disposal sites as well as costs associated with cleanup of accidents involving our vehicles we do not believe that the cost of future compliance with current environmental laws or regulations will have a material adverse effect on our operations financial condition competitive position or capital expenditures for the remainder of 2017  or fiscal year 2018 however future changes to laws or regulations may adversely affect our operations and could result in unforeseen costs to our business

 item 1a risk factors 

various factors exist that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those projected in any forwardlooking statement in addition to the factors discussed elsewhere in this report we believe the following are some of the important risks and uncertainties that could materially affect our business financial condition or results of operations 

we operate in a highly competitive industry and our business will suffer if we are unable to adequately address potential downward pricing pressures and other factors that may adversely affect our operations and profitability 

numerous competitive factors could impair our ability to maintain our current profitability these factors include but are not limited to the following 

 

if we are unable to effectively compete with other ltl carriers whether on the basis of price service or otherwise we may be unable to retain existing customers or attract new customers either of which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations furthermore continued merger and acquisition activity in transportation and logistics could result in stronger or new competitors which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations we may not be able to compete successfully in an increasingly consolidated ltl industry and cannot predict with certainty how industry consolidation will affect our competitors or us 

if our employees were to unionize our operating costs would increase and our ability to compete would be impaired 

none of our employees are currently represented under a collective bargaining agreement however from time to time there have been efforts to organize our employees at various service centers further congress or one or more states could approve legislation andor the national labor relations board could render decisions or implement rule changes that could significantly affect our business and our relationship with our employees including actions that could substantially liberalize the procedures for union organization in addition we can offer no assurance that the department of labor will not adopt new 

regulations or interpret existing regulations in a manner that would favor the agenda of unions or that our employees will not unionize in the future particularly if regulatory changes occur that facilitate unionization 

the unionization of our employees could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations because 

 

if we are unable to successfully execute our growth strategy our business and future results of operations may suffer 

our growth strategy includes increasing the volume of freight moving through our existing service center network selectively expanding our capacity and broadening the scope of our service offerings in connection with our growth strategy at various times we have expanded and upgraded service centers purchased additional equipment and increased our sales and marketing efforts and we expect to continue to do so our growth strategy exposes us to a number of risks including the following 

 

we cannot assure that we will overcome the risks associated with our growth strategy if we fail to overcome those risks we may not realize additional revenue or profits from our efforts we may incur additional expenses and as a result our financial position and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 

we may be unable to successfully consummate and integrate acquisitions as part of our growth strategy 

growth through acquisitions historically has been a key component of our ltl growth strategy in the future we may seek to acquire other ltl carriers as well as other complementary businesses exploration of potential acquisitions requires significant attention from our management team in addition we expect to compete for acquisition opportunities with other companies some of which may have greater financial and other resources than we do we cannot ensure that we will have sufficient cash to consummate an acquisition or otherwise be able to obtain financing for an acquisition if we are unable to access sufficient funding for potential acquisitions we may not be able to complete transactions that we otherwise find advantageous 

any subsequent acquisition will entail numerous risks including 



 

in addition we may have difficulty integrating any acquired business and its operations services and personnel into our existing operations and such integration may require a significant amount of time and effort by our management team to the extent we do not successfully avoid or overcome the risks or problems resulting from any acquisitions we undertake there could be a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our customers’ and suppliers’ businesses may be impacted by various economic factors such as recessions downturns in the economy global uncertainty and instability changes in us social political and regulatory conditions andor a disruption of financial markets which may decrease demand for our services 

adverse economic conditions both in the united states and internationally can negatively affect our customers’ business levels the amount of transportation services they need their ability to pay for our services and overall freight levels any of which might impair our asset utilization additionally uncertainty and instability in the global economy such as the united kingdoms decision to exit the european union may lead to fewer goods being transported customers encountering adverse economic conditions may be unable to obtain additional financing or financing under acceptable terms due to disruptions in the capital and credit markets these customers represent a greater potential for bad debt losses which may require us to increase our reserve for bad debt economic conditions resulting in bankruptcies of one or more of our large customers could have a significant impact on our financial position results of operations or liquidity in a particular year or quarter further when adverse economic times arise customers may select competitors that offer lower rates in an attempt to lower their costs and we might be forced to lower our rates or lose freight volumes 

our suppliers’ business levels also may be negatively affected by adverse economic conditions and changes in the political and regulatory environment both in the united states and internationally or financial constraints which could lead to disruptions in the supply and availability of equipment parts and services critical to our operations a significant interruption in our normal supply chain could disrupt our operations increase our costs and negatively impact our ability to serve our customers 

we are also subject to cost increases outside of our control that could materially reduce our profitability if we are unable to increase our rates sufficiently such cost increases include but are not limited to increases in fuel prices interest rates taxes tolls license and registration fees insurance revenue equipment and healthcare for our employees 

difficulties attracting and retaining qualified drivers could result in increases in driver compensation and could adversely affect our profitability our ability to maintain or grow our fleet and our ability to maintain our customer relationships 

from time to time we have experienced difficulty in attracting and retaining sufficient numbers of qualified drivers and such shortages may recur in the future due in part to the time commitment physical requirements our stringent hiring standards and current industry conditions the available pool of qualified employee drivers has been declining because of the intense competition for drivers we may face difficulty maintaining or increasing our number of drivers the compensation we offer our drivers is subject to market conditions that may require increases in driver compensation if we are unable to attract and retain a sufficient number of qualified drivers we could be required to adjust our compensation packages amend our hiring standards or operate with fewer trucks and face difficulty meeting customer demands any of which could adversely affect our growth and profitability 

the fmcsa’s csa initiative could adversely impact our ability to hire qualified drivers meet our growth projections and maintain our customer relationships each of which could adversely impact our results of operations 

the fmcsa’s compliance safety accountability initiative csa is an enforcement and compliance program designed to monitor and improve commercial motor vehicle safety by measuring the safety record of both the motor carrier and 

the driver these measurements are scored and used by the fmcsa to identify potential safety risks and to direct enforcement action 

our csa scores are dependent upon our safety and compliance experience which could change at any time in addition the safety standards prescribed in csa could change and our ability to maintain an acceptable score could be adversely impacted public disclosure of certain csa scores was restricted through the enactment of the fixing america’s surface transportation act of 2015 the “fast act” on december 4 2015 however the fast act does not restrict public disclosure of all data collected by the fmcsa if we receive unacceptable csa scores and this data is made available to the public our relationships with our customers could be damaged which could result in a loss of business 

the requirements of the csa could also shrink the industry’s pool of drivers as those with unfavorable scores could leave the industry as a result the costs to attract train and retain qualified drivers could increase in addition a shortage of qualified drivers could increase driver turnover decrease asset utilization limit growth and adversely impact our results of operations 

insurance and claims expenses could significantly reduce our profitability 

we are exposed to claims related to cargo loss and damage property damage personal injury workers’ compensation group health and group dental we have insurance coverage with thirdparty insurance carriers but we assume a significant portion of the risk associated with these claims due to our sirs and deductibles our operating results could be adversely affected if any of the following were to occur i the number or the severity of claims increases ii we are required to accrue or pay additional amounts because claims prove to be more severe than our original assessment or iii claims exceed our coverage amounts if claims exceed our sir or deductible levels insurance companies exit the transportation insurance marketplace or insurance market conditions change insurers could raise premiums for excess coverage to cover their expenses and anticipated future losses in addition insurance companies generally require us to collateralize our sir or deductible levels if these collateralization requirements increase our borrowing capacity could be adversely affected 

healthcare legislation may increase our costs and reduce our future profitability 

to attract and retain employees we maintain a competitive health insurance plan for our employees and their dependents we cannot predict the impact that any state or federal healthcare legislation or regulation will have on our operations but we expect costs associated with providing benefits under employee medical plans and healthcarerelated costs associated with workers compensation to continue to increase rising healthcare costs in the united states could result in significant longterm costs to us which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results in addition rising healthcare costs could force us to make further changes to our benefits program which could negatively impact our ability to attract and retain employees 

we have significant ongoing cash requirements that could limit our growth and affect our profitability if we are unable to obtain sufficient capital 

our business is highly capital intensive we generally finance our capital expenditures and planned growth with existing cash cash flow from operations issuance of debt and through available borrowings under our existing senior unsecured credit agreement we may require additional capital to finance longterm real estate purchase opportunities and acquisitions which we may fund through additional debt or through equity offerings if we are unable to generate sufficient cash from our operations or raise capital by accessing the debt and equity markets we may be forced to limit our growth and operate our equipment for longer periods of time which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results 

our business also has significant ongoing operating cash requirements if our cash requirements are high or our cash flow from operations is low during particular periods we may need to seek additional financing which could be costly or difficult to obtain 

limited supply and increased costs of new equipment may adversely affect our earnings and cash flow 

we may face difficulty in purchasing new equipment due to decreased supply and increased costs investment in new equipment is a significant part of our annual capital expenditures and we require an available supply of tractors and trailers from equipment manufacturers to operate and grow our business we may also be subject to shortages in raw materials that are required for the production of critical operating equipment and supplies such as shortages in rubber or steel 

the price of our equipment may also be adversely affected in the future by regulations on newly manufactured tractors and diesel engines we are subject to regulations issued by the us environmental protection agency the “epa” and various state agencies that have required progressive reductions in exhaust emissions from diesel engines these regulations have resulted in higher prices for tractors and diesel engines and increased operating and maintenance costs and there can be no assurance that continued increases in pricing or costs will not have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

we may be adversely impacted by fluctuations in the availability and price of diesel fuel 

diesel fuel is a critical component of our operations and a significant operating expense for our business future fluctuations in prices and diesel fuel availability could have a material adverse effect on our operating results diesel fuel prices and fuel availability can be impacted by factors beyond our control such as natural or manmade disasters adverse weather conditions political events disruption or failure of technology or information systems price and supply decisions by oil producing countries and cartels terrorist activities armed conflict and world supply and demand imbalances we maintain fuel storage and pumping facilities at many of our service center locations however we may be susceptible to fuel shortages at certain locations that could cause us to incur additional expense to ensure adequate supply on a timely basis and to prevent a disruption to our service schedules an interruption in the supply of diesel fuel could have a material adverse effect on our operating results 

we do not hedge against the risk of diesel fuel price increases an increase in diesel fuel prices or diesel fuel taxes or any change in federal or state regulations that results in such an increase could have a material adverse effect on our operating results we have fuel surcharge programs in place with a majority of our customers which help offset the negative impact of the increased cost of diesel fuel and other petroleumbased products however we also incur fuel costs that cannot be recovered even with respect to customers with which we maintain fuel surcharge programs such as those costs associated with empty miles or the time during which our engines are idling because our fuel surcharge recovery lags behind changes in fuel prices our fuel surcharge recovery may not capture the increased costs we pay for fuel especially when prices are rising leading to fluctuations in our levels of reimbursement we regularly monitor the components of our pricing including fuel surcharges and address individual account profitability issues with our customers when necessary however there can be no assurance that fuel surcharges can be maintained indefinitely or will be sufficiently effective in offsetting increases in diesel fuel prices 

we are subject to various governmental laws and regulations and costs of compliance with liabilities under or violations of existing or future governmental laws or regulations could adversely affect our business 

we are subject to various federal state and local governmental laws and regulations that govern among other things the emission and discharge of hazardous materials into the environment the presence of hazardous materials at our properties or in our vehicles fuel storage tanks the transportation of certain materials and the discharge or retention of storm water under certain environmental laws we could also be held responsible for any costs relating to contamination at our past or present facilities and at thirdparty waste disposal sites as well as costs associated with the cleanup of accidents involving our vehicles environmental laws have become and are expected to continue to be increasingly more stringent over time and there can be no assurance that our costs of complying with current or future environmental laws or liabilities arising under such laws will not have a material adverse effect on our business operations or financial condition 

in addition to the epa regulations on exhaust emissions with which we must comply there is an increased regulatory focus on climate change and greenhouse gas emissions we are also subject to increasing sensitivity to sustainability issues this increased focus on sustainability may result in new regulations andor customer requirements that could adversely impact our business any future limitations on the emission of greenhouse gases other environmental legislation or customer sustainability requirements could increase our future capital expenditures and have an adverse impact on our financial condition results of operations and liquidity 

we are subject to the risks of litigation and governmental proceedings or inquiries which could adversely affect our business 

the nature of our business exposes us to the potential for various claims and litigation related to labor and employment personal injury property damage cargo claims safety and contract compliance environmental liability and other matters accordingly we are and in the future may be subject to legal proceedings and claims that have arisen in the ordinary course of our business and may include classaction allegations we are also subject to potential governmental proceedings inquiries 

and claims the parties in such actions may seek amounts from us that may not be covered in whole or in part by insurance defending ourselves against such actions could result in significant costs and could require a substantial amount of time and effort by our management team we cannot predict the outcome of litigation or governmental proceedings or inquiries to which we are a party or whether we will be subject to future legal actions as a result the potential costs associated with legal actions against us could adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations 

we are subject to various risks arising from our international business operations and relationships which could adversely affect our business 

we arrange for transportation and logistics services to and from various international locations and are subject to both the risks of conducting international business and the requirements of the foreign corrupt practices act of 1977 the fcpa failure to comply with the fcpa may result in legal claims against us in addition we face other risks associated with international operations and relationships which may include restrictive trade policies imposition of duties taxes or government royalties imposed by foreign governments 

we operate in a highly regulated industry and increased costs of compliance with or liability for violation of existing or future regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business 

we are regulated by the dot and by various state agencies these regulatory authorities have broad powers generally governing matters such as authority to engage in motor carrier operations as well as motor carrier registration driver hours of service safety and fitness of transportation equipment and drivers transportation of hazardous materials certain mergers and acquisitions and periodic financial reporting the trucking industry is also subject to regulatory and legislative changes from a variety of other governmental authorities which address matters such as increasingly stringent environmental occupational safety and health regulations limits on vehicle weight and size ergonomics port security and hours of service in addition we are subject to compliance with cargosecurity and transportation regulations issued by the tsa and cbp within the us department of homeland security regulatory requirements and changes in regulatory requirements may affect our business or the economics of the industry by requiring changes in operating practices or by influencing the demand for and increasing the costs of providing transportation services 

our results of operations may be affected by seasonal factors harsh weather conditions and disasters 

our operations are subject to seasonal trends common in our industry our revenue and operating margins in the first and fourth quarters are typically lower than those during the second and third quarters due to reduced shipments during the winter months harsh winter weather or natural disasters such as hurricanes tornadoes and floods can also adversely impact our performance by reducing demand and reducing our ability to transport freight which could result in decreased revenue and increased operating expenses 

if we are unable to retain our key employees or if we do not effectively execute our succession plan our financial condition results of operations and liquidity could be adversely affected 

our success will continue to depend upon the experience and leadership of our key employees and executive officers in that regard the loss of the services of any of our key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and liquidity if we are unable to secure replacement personnel who have sufficient experience in our industry and in the management of our business if we are unable to continue to develop and retain a core group of management personnel and execute succession planning strategies or we encounter any unforeseen difficulties associated with the recent transition of members of our management team our business could be negatively impacted in the future 

our principal shareholders control a large portion of our outstanding common stock 

earl e congdon david s congdon john r congdon jr and members of their respective families beneficially own an aggregate of approximately 26 of the outstanding shares of our common stock as long as the congdon family controls a large portion of our voting stock they may be able to significantly influence the election of the entire board of directors and the outcome of all matters involving a shareholder vote the congdon family’s interests may differ from the interests of other shareholders and the status of their ownership could change at their discretion 

our financial results may be adversely impacted by potential future changes in accounting practices 

future changes in accounting standards or practices and related legal and regulatory interpretations of those changes may adversely impact public companies in general the transportation industry or our operations specifically new accounting standards or requirements could change the way we record revenues expenses assets andor liabilities or could be costly to implement these types of regulations could have a negative impact on our financial position liquidity results of operations andor access to capital 

our information technology systems are subject to cyber and other risks some of which are beyond our control which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial position 

we are reliant on the proper functioning and availability of our information systems for our operations as well as providing a valueadded service to our customers our information systems including our accounting communications and data processing systems are integral to the efficient operation of our business it is critical that the data processed by these systems remain confidential as it often includes competitive customer information confidential customer credit card and transaction data employee records and key financial and operational results and statistics cyber incidents that impact the security availability reliability speed accuracy or other proper functioning of these systems and measures including outages computer viruses breakins and similar disruptions could have a significant impact on our operations we utilize thirdparty service providers who have access to our systems and certain sensitive data which exposes us to additional security risks although our information systems are protected through physical and software safeguards as well as redundant systems network security measures and backup systems it is difficult to fully protect against the possibility of power loss telecommunications failures cyber attacks and other cyber incidents in every potential circumstance that may arise a significant cyber incident including system failure security breach disruption by malware or other damage could interrupt or delay our operations damage our reputation cause a loss of customers expose us to a risk of loss or litigation andor cause us to incur significant time and expense to remedy such an event any of which could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial position 

failure to keep pace with developments in technology any disruption to our technology infrastructure or failures of essential services upon which our technology platforms rely could cause us to incur costs or result in a loss of business which may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

we rely heavily on information technology systems our information technology systems are complex and require ongoing investments and enhancements to meet both internal requirements and the requirements of our customers if we are unable to invest in and enhance our technology systems in a timely manner or at a reasonable cost or if we are unable to train our employees to operate the new or enhanced systems our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected we also may not achieve the benefits that we anticipate from any new technology or system and a failure to do so could result in higher than anticipated costs or adversely affect our results of operations 

our information technology systems also depend upon the internet thirdparty service providers global communications providers satellitebased communications systems the electric utilities grid electric utility providers and telecommunications providers we have minimal control over the operation quality or maintenance of these services or whether vendors will improve their services or continue to provide services that are essential to our business disruptions due to transitional challenges in upgrading or enhancing our technology systems failures in the services upon which our information technology platforms rely including those that may arise from adverse weather conditions or natural calamities such as floods hurricanes earthquakes or tornadoes illegal acts including terrorist attacks human error or systems modernization initiatives andor other disruptions may adversely affect our business which could increase our costs or result in a loss of customers that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position 

damage to our reputation through unfavorable publicity could adversely affect our financial condition 

in the current environment of instantaneous communication and social media outlets the quick and broad dissemination of information through media sources could cause damaging information about us whether accurate or not to be broadly publicized unfavorable publicity about us or our employees could damage our reputation and may result in a reduction in demand for our services or the loss of customers that could have a negative impact on our financial condition results of operations and liquidity this unfavorable publicity could also require the need to allocate significant resources to the rebuilding of our reputation 

antiterrorism measures may disrupt our business 

federal state and municipal authorities have implemented and are continuing to implement various antiterrorism measures including checkpoints and travel restrictions on large trucks if additional security measures disrupt or impede the timing of our deliveries we may fail to meet the requirements of our customers or incur increased expenses to do so there can be no assurance that new antiterrorism measures will not be implemented and that such measures will not have a material adverse effect on our operations 

a decrease in the demand and value of used equipment may impact our results of operations 

as we purchase new tractors and trailers as part of our normal replacement cycle each year we rely on the used equipment market to dispose of our older equipment oversupply in the transportation industry as well as adverse domestic and foreign economic conditions can negatively impact the demand for used equipment and therefore reduce the value we can obtain on our used equipment if we are unable to sell our older equipment at or above our salvage value the resulting losses could have a significant impact on our results of operations 

if we raise additional capital in the future your ownership in us could be diluted 

any issuance of equity we may undertake in the future to raise additional capital could cause the price of our common stock to decline or require us to issue shares at a price that is lower than that paid by holders of our common stock in the past which would result in those newly issued shares being dilutive if we obtain funds through a credit facility or through the issuance of debt or preferred securities these obligations and securities would likely have rights senior to your rights as a common shareholder which could impair the value of our common stock 

there can be no assurance of our ability to declare and pay cash dividends in future periods 

on february 2 2017 we announced that our board of directors had declared the first quarterly cash dividend on our common stock the dividend of 010 per share is payable on march 20 2017 to shareholders of record at the close of business on march 6 2017 we intend to pay a quarterly cash dividend to holders of our common stock for the foreseeable future however dividend payments are subject to approval by our board of directors and are restricted by applicable state law limitations on distributions to shareholders as well as certain covenants under our revolving credit facility as a result future dividend payments are not guaranteed and will depend upon various factors such as our overall financial condition available liquidity anticipated cash needs future prospects for earnings and cash flows as well as other factors considered relevant by our board of directors in addition any reduction or suspension in our dividend payments could adversely affect the price of our common stock 

the market value of our common stock may fluctuate and could be substantially affected by various factors 

the price of our common stock on the nasdaq global select market changes constantly we expect that the market price of our common stock will continue to fluctuate due to a variety of factors many of which are beyond our control these factors include among others 

 

our common stock price may fluctuate significantly in the future and these fluctuations may be unrelated to our performance general market price declines or market volatility in the future could adversely affect the price of our common stock and the current market price of our common stock may not be indicative of future market prices 

our articles of incorporation our bylaws and virginia law contain provisions that could discourage delay or prevent a change in our control or our management 

provisions of our articles of incorporation bylaws and the laws of virginia the state in which we are incorporated may discourage delay or prevent a change in control of us or a change in management that shareholders may consider favorable these provisions

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

overview 

we are a leading lessthantruckload “ltl” unionfree motor carrier providing regional interregional and national ltl services which include ground and air expedited transportation and consumer household pickup and delivery through a single integrated organization in addition to our core ltl services we offer a range of valueadded services including container drayage truckload brokerage supply chain consulting and warehousing more than 97 of our revenue has historically been derived from transporting ltl shipments for our customers whose demand for our services is generally tied to industrial production and the overall health of the us domestic economy 

in analyzing the components of our revenue we monitor changes and trends in our ltl services using the following key metrics which exclude certain transportation and logistics services where pricing is generally not determined by weight commodity or distance 

 

revenue per hundredweight is a commonlyused indicator of pricing trends but this metric can be influenced by many other factors such as changes in fuel surcharges weight per shipment length of haul and the class or mix of our freight as a result changes in revenue per hundredweight do not necessarily indicate actual changes in underlying base rates 

   

 

our primary revenue focus is to increase “density” which is shipment and tonnage growth within our existing infrastructure increases in density allow us to maximize our asset utilization and labor productivity which we measure over many different functional areas of our operations including linehaul load factor pickup and delivery “pd” stops per hour pd shipments per hour platform pounds handled per hour and platform shipments per hour in addition to our focus on density and operating efficiencies it is critical for us to obtain an appropriate yield which is measured as revenue per hundredweight on the shipments we handle we manage our yields by focusing on individual account profitability we believe yield management and improvements in efficiency are key components in our ability to produce profitable growth 

our primary cost elements are direct wages and benefits associated with the movement of freight operating supplies and expenses which include diesel fuel and depreciation of our equipment fleet and service center facilities we gauge our overall success in managing costs by monitoring our operating ratio a measure of profitability calculated by dividing total operating expenses by revenue which also allows for industrywide comparisons with our competition 

we continually upgrade our technological capabilities to improve our customer service and lower our operating costs our technology provides our customers with visibility of their shipments throughout our network increases the productivity of our workforce and provides key metrics that we use to monitor and enhance our processes 

results of operations 

the following table sets forth for the years indicated expenses and other items as a percentage of revenue from operations 



  

   

although our revenue for 2016 increased slightly we believe demand for our service during 2016 was impacted by general weakness in the domestic economy we believe that some shippers placed more emphasis on the cost of service in 2016 rather than our highquality total value proposition which also resulted in some freight diversion to lower cost carriers we nonetheless remained committed to our pricing philosophy and focused on providing superior customer service during 2016 ontime deliveries were above 99 and our cargo claims ratio was below 03 we continue to believe that providing superior service at a fair price will drive additional growth in market share for us particularly in a strong economy 

we also maintained our longterm commitment to the continuous investment in our business in 2016 we spent 4179 million on real estate equipment and technology to increase the capacity of our network to accommodate future growth while also meeting the increasing service demands of our customers as a result of these investments and lower than expected revenue growth certain operating costs as a percent of revenue increased during 2016 this led to a 60 basispoint increase in our operating ratio to 838 as compared to our company record 832 in 2015 net income decreased 89 million or 29 and diluted earnings per share decreased 03 to 356 in 2016 as compared to 357 in 2015 

2016  compared to 2015   

key financial and operating metrics for 2016  and 2015  are presented below 



revenue 

our revenue in 2016 increased 191 million or 06 as compared to 2015 due to a 459 million increase in ltl revenue partially offset by a 268 million reduction in nonltl revenue ltl revenue was higher in 2016 as a result of an increase in ltl revenue per hundredweight that was negatively impacted by a slight decline in ltl tonnage the reduction in nonltl revenue was primarily due to strategic changes in our container drayage and international freight forwarding service offerings that we initiated in the second half of 2015 

ltl revenue per hundredweight increased 15 to 1851 in 2016 primarily due to our disciplined yield management process and a generally stable pricing environment the increase in ltl revenue per hundredweight was negatively impacted by a decline in our fuel surcharges that reflected lower average diesel fuel prices excluding fuel surcharges ltl revenue per hundredweight increased 26 in 2016 as compared to 2015 

most of our tariffs and contracts provide for a fuel surcharge that is generally indexed to the does published diesel fuel prices that reset each week our fuel surcharges are designed to offset fluctuations in the cost of petroleumbased products and are one of the many components included in the overall negotiated price we charge for our services fuel surcharge revenue decreased to 95 of revenue in 2016 from 104 in 2015 primarily due to a decrease in the average price per gallon for diesel fuel for those comparative periods we regularly monitor the components of our pricing including base freight rates and fuel surcharges and our costs at the customer level we address individual customer profitability issues to minimize the negative impact on our profitability that would likely result from a rapid and significant change in any of our operating expenses 

first quarter 2017 update 

total revenue per day for january 2017 increased 53 as compared to january 2016 which includes a 22 increase in ltl tons per day 

operating costs and other expenses 

salaries wages and benefits increased 823 million or 52 in 2016 due to a 471 million increase in salaries and wages and a 352 million increase in benefit costs the increase in salaries and wages excluding benefits was due primarily to the impact of the annual wage increases provided to employees in september 2015 and 2016 and an increase in our direct labor costs to support our strategic reduction in purchased transportation we implemented certain operational initiatives in the second half of 2015 to decrease our reliance on purchased transportation providers but these changes increased our utilization of company employees and equipment these increases were partially offset by lower performancebased compensation linked to operating results as well as improvements in productivity platform pounds and platform shipments per hour improved 40 and 38 respectively in 2016 as compared to 2015 both pd stops and pd shipments per hour remained consistent between the periods compared while our linehaul laden load average declined 17 as compared to 2015 our aggregate productive labor costs increased to 289 of revenue in 2016 as compared to 279 in 2015 while our other indirect salaries and wages increased to 122 of revenue in 2016 as compared to 119 in 2015 

employee benefit costs increased 352 million or 91 in 2016 compared to 2015 primarily due to higher costs for our group health and dental plans and an increase in certain retirement benefit plan costs that are directly linked to the market price of our common stock our group health and dental costs were higher in 2016 primarily due to a 58 increase in the average cost per covered employee as compared to 2015 as a result our employee benefit costs increased to 342 of salaries and wages in 2016 as compared to 326 in 2015 

operating supplies and expenses decreased 309 million in 2016 as compared to 2015 these costs as a percent of revenue improved to 108 of revenue in 2016 from 119 of revenue in 2015 primarily due to a reduction in fuel costs the cost of diesel fuel excluding fuel taxes represents the largest component of operating supplies and expenses and can vary based on both average price per gallon and consumption the decrease in our diesel fuel costs excluding fuel taxes during 2016 was due primarily to a 134 decline in our average cost per gallon while our fuel consumption remained relatively consistent between the periods compared despite the increase in miles driven our fuel consumption benefited from an overall improvement in miles per gallon which continues to improve as we add newer more fuelefficient equipment to our operations we do not use diesel fuel hedging instruments and are therefore subject to market price fluctuations other operating supplies and expenses excluding diesel fuel remained relatively consistent as a percent of revenue between the periods compared 

depreciation and amortization increased 245 million due primarily to the assets acquired as part of our 2015 and 2016 capital expenditure programs as a percent of revenue our depreciation and amortization expense increased to 63 in 2016 compared to 56 in 2015 we believe depreciation will continue to increase based on our 2017 capital expenditure plan while our investments in real estate equipment and technology can increase our costs in the shortterm we believe these investments are necessary to support our continued growth and strategic initiatives 

purchased transportation decreased 422 million or 363 in 2016 as compared to 2015 the decrease was due primarily to the strategic elimination of certain services in the second quarter of 2015 that reduced our use of thirdparty providers for the remainder of 2015 and throughout 2016 we continue to utilize purchased transportation services when beneficial to support our ltl services and other nonltl services including our container drayage and truckload brokerage services 

our effective tax rate in 2016 was 381 as compared to 378 in 2015 our effective tax rates in 2016 and 2015 were favorably impacted by various tax credits our effective tax rate generally exceeds the federal statutory rate of 35 due to the impact of state taxes and to a lesser extent certain other nondeductible items 

2015  compared to 2014   

key financial and operating metrics for 2015  and 2014  are presented below 



revenue 

our revenue in 2015 increased 1845 million or 66 as compared to 2014 ltl tonnage increased 74 primarily due to an 116 increase in ltl shipments although our tonnage growth was affected by a 38 decrease in weight per shipment we attribute the decline in weight per shipment in 2015 to softening economic conditions and changes in the mix of our freight as compared to 2014 

ltl revenue per hundredweight decreased 05 to 1823 in 2015 primarily due to declines in our fuel surcharges ltl revenue per hundredweight excluding fuel surcharges increased 57 in 2015 as compared to 2014 which included the positive effect on this metric from a decrease in weight per shipment we believe the increase in revenue per hundredweight excluding fuel surcharges reflected our continued commitment to a disciplined yield management process and a relatively stable pricing environment 

most of our tariffs and contracts provide for a fuel surcharge that is generally indexed to the does published diesel fuel prices that reset each week our fuel surcharges are designed to offset fluctuations in the cost of petroleumbased products and are one of the many components included in the overall negotiated price we charge for our services fuel surcharge revenue decreased to 104 of revenue in 2015 from 155 in 2014 primarily due to a decrease in the average price per gallon for diesel fuel for those comparative periods 

operating costs and other expenses 

salaries wages and benefits increased 1885 million or 136 in 2015 due to a 1436 million increase in salaries and wages and a 449 million increase in benefit costs the increase in salaries and wages excluding benefits was primarily due to an increase in the average number of fulltime employees of 2063 or 135 over 2014 as well as annual wage increases provided to our employees in september of 2014 and 2015 the increase in fulltime employees was necessary to provide capacity for the increase in shipments during the year we also implemented certain operational initiatives that decreased our reliance on purchased transportation providers and increased our utilization of company employees and equipment the additional freight density contributed to a slight improvement in our pd and platform shipments per hour which improved 11 and 18 respectively from 2014 our aggregate productive labor costs increased to 279 of revenue in 2015 as compared to 258 in 2014 while our other salaries and wages increased to 119 of revenue in 2015 as compared to 115 in 2014 

employee benefit costs increased 449 million or 132 primarily due to an increase in the number of fulltime employees eligible for benefits certain enhancements to paidtimeoff benefits and an increase in our workers compensation expense these increases were partially offset by a reduction in expense for certain retirement benefit plans directly linked to the share price of our common stock our group health costs increased in the fourth quarter of 2015 and continued to increase into 2016 employee benefit costs in 2015 were 326 of salaries and wages as compared to 328 in 2014 

operating supplies and expenses decreased 788 million in 2015 as compared to 2014 the cost of diesel fuel excluding fuel taxes represents the largest component of operating supplies and expenses and can vary based on both average price per gallon and consumption our diesel fuel costs decreased primarily due to a 337 decrease in our average cost per gallon during 2015 as compared to the prior year this decrease was partially offset by an increase in fuel consumption of 91 primarily due to an 116 increase in linehaul and pd miles driven our fuel consumption benefited from an overall improvement in miles per gallon which continues to improve as we add newer more fuelefficient equipment to our operations the additional fuel consumption resulted in an increase in fuel taxes which increased our operating taxes and licenses 

depreciation and amortization expenses increased 189 million primarily due to the assets acquired through our 2015 and 2014 capital expenditures as a percent of revenue our depreciation and amortization expense increased to 56 in 2015 compared to 53 in 2014 

purchased transportation expense decreased 130 million or 101 in 2015 as compared to 2014 we primarily utilized purchased transportation services from thirdparty providers to support our container drayage international freightforwarding and truckload brokerage services we also utilized purchased transportation to perform limited services in our ltl operations the decrease in purchased transportation was primarily due to operational improvement initiatives to reduce our use of thirdparty providers for the movement of our customers’ shipments 

our effective tax rate in 2015 was 378 as compared to 381 in 2014 our effective tax rates in 2015 and 2014 were favorably impacted by various tax credits including credits for the use of alternative fuel in our operations our effective tax rate generally exceeds the federal statutory rate of 35 due to the impact of state taxes and to a lesser extent certain other nondeductible items 

liquidity and capital resources 

a summary of our cash flows is presented below 



the change in our cash flows provided by operating activities during 2016 was impacted by an increase in depreciation and amortization of 245 million as compared to 2015 this increase was partially offset by an 89 million decrease in net income as well as other fluctuations in certain working capital accounts 

the change in our cash flows provided by operating activities in 2015 as compared to 2014 was due primarily to fluctuations within our working capital accounts which included changes in income taxes customer receivables and certain accrued liabilities in addition an increase in our net income and higher depreciation and amortization expenses in 2015 as compared to 2014 as described above in “ results of operations ” also resulted in increased cash flows provided by operating activities 

the changes in our cash flows used in investing activities for all periods were due primarily to fluctuations in our capital expenditure programs and proceeds from asset disposals each year changes in our capital expenditures are more fully described below in “capital expenditures” 

the changes in our cash flows used in financing activities for all periods were due primarily to increases in repurchases of our common stock fluctuations in our senior unsecured revolving line of credit and scheduled principal payments under our longterm debt agreements our repurchases of common stock and financing arrangements are more fully described below in  stock repurchase program  and  financing agreements  respectively 

we have three primary sources of available liquidity cash and cash equivalents cash flows from operations and available borrowings under our senior unsecured revolving credit agreement which is described below we believe we also have sufficient access to debt and equity markets to provide other sources of liquidity if needed 

capital expenditures 

the table below sets forth our net capital expenditures for property and equipment including those obtained through capital leases for the years ended december 31 2016  2015  and 2014  



our capital expenditures varied based upon the projected increase in the number and size of our service center facilities to support our plan for longterm growth our planned tractor and trailer replacement cycle and forecasted tonnage and shipment growth expenditures for land and structures can be dependent upon the availability of land in the geographic areas where we are looking to expand we expect to continue to maintain a high level of capital expenditures in order to support our longterm plan for market share growth 

we currently estimate capital expenditures will be approximately 385 million for the year ending december 31 2017 approximately 185 million is allocated for the purchase of service center facilities construction of new service center facilities or expansion of existing service center facilities subject to the availability of suitable real estate and the timing of construction projects approximately 155 million is allocated for the purchase of tractors and trailers and approximately 45 million is allocated for investments in technology and other assets we expect to fund these capital expenditures primarily through cash flows from operations our existing cash and cash equivalents and the use of our senior unsecured revolving credit facility we believe our current sources of liquidity will be sufficient to satisfy our expected capital expenditures 

stock repurchase program 

during the second quarter of 2016 we completed our 2000 million stock repurchase program previously announced on november 10 2014 on may 23 2016 we announced that our board of directors had approved the 2016 repurchase program under which we may repurchase up to 2500 million of shares of our common stock from time to time in open market purchases or through privately negotiated transactions shares of our common stock repurchased under our repurchase programs are canceled at the time of repurchase and are authorized but unissued shares of our common stock 

during the years ended december 31 2016  2015  and 2014  we repurchased 2062841 1682419 and 70620 shares of our common stock under our repurchase programs for an aggregate of 1303 million 1141 million and 55 million respectively as of december 31 2016  we had 2000 million remaining authorized under the 2016 repurchase program 

dividends to shareholders 

on february 2 2017 we announced that our board of directors had declared a quarterly cash dividend of 010 per share payable on march 20 2017 to shareholders of record at the close of business on march 6 2017 we anticipate that the quarterly cash dividend will be funded through cash flow from operations and if needed borrowings under our revolving credit facility although we intend to pay a quarterly cash dividend on our common stock for the foreseeable future the declaration of any future dividend is subject to approval by our board of directors and is restricted by applicable state law limitations on distributions to shareholders as well as certain covenants under our revolving credit facility we did not declare or pay a dividend on our common stock in 2016  or 2015  

financing agreements 

we have one unsecured senior note agreement with an amount outstanding of 950 million at december 31 2016  at december 31 2015  we had two unsecured senior note agreements with an aggregate amount outstanding of 1200 million the remaining unsecured senior note agreement calls for two scheduled principal payments of 500 million and 450 million on january 3 2018 and january 3 2021 respectively interest rates on the january 3 2018 and january 3 2021 scheduled principal payments are 400 and 479 respectively the effective average interest rates on our outstanding senior note agreements were 437 and 468 at december 31 2016 and 2015 respectively 

on december 15 2015 we entered into an amended and restated credit agreement with wells fargo bank national association wells fargo serving as administrative agent for the lenders the credit agreement the credit agreement originally provided for a fiveyear 2500 million senior unsecured revolving line of credit and a 1000 million accordion feature which if exercised and approved would expand the total borrowing capacity up to an aggregate of 3500 million 

on september 9 2016 we exercised a portion of the accordion feature and entered into an amendment to the credit agreement to increase the aggregate commitments from existing lenders by 500 million to an aggregate of 3000 million of the 3000 million line of credit commitments under the credit agreement as amended up to 1000 million may be used for letters of credit and 300 million may be used for borrowings under the wells fargo sweep plus loan program the sweep program we utilize the sweep program to manage our daily cash needs as it automatically initiates borrowings to cover overnight cash requirements primarily for working capital needs the credit agreement matures on december 15 2020 

at our option borrowings under the credit agreement bear interest at either i libor plus an applicable margin based on our ratio of net debttototal capitalization that ranges from 10  to 150  or ii a base rate plus an applicable margin based on our ratio of net debttototal capitalization that ranges from 00  to 05  loans under the sweep program bear interest at the libor plus applicable margin rate letter of credit fees equal to the applicable margin for libor loans are charged quarterly in arrears on the daily average aggregate stated amount of all letters of credit outstanding during the quarter commitment fees ranging from 0125  to 02  based upon the ratio of net debttototal capitalization are charged quarterly in arrears on the aggregate unutilized portion of the credit agreement wells fargo as administrative agent also receives an annual fee for providing administrative services 

for the year ended december 31 2016  the applicable margin on libor loans was 10  and commitment fees were 0125  for the year ended december 31 2015  the applicable margin on libor loans was 10  and commitment fees ranged from 0125  to 0175  there were 746 million  and 677 million  of outstanding letters of credit at december 31 2016  and 2015  respectively letter of credit fees remained at 10  during the years ended december 31 2016  and 2015  

the amounts outstanding and remaining borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facilities are presented below 



with the exception of borrowings pursuant to the credit agreement interest rates are fixed on all of our debt instruments therefore shortterm exposure to fluctuations in interest rates is limited to our line of credit facility we do not currently use interest rate derivative instruments to manage exposure to interest rate changes 

our senior note agreement and credit agreement contain customary covenants including financial covenants that require us to observe a maximum ratio of debt to total capital and a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio any future whollyowned material domestic subsidiaries of the company would be required to guarantee payment of all of our obligations under these agreements the credit agreement also includes a provision limiting our ability to make restricted payments including dividends and payments for share repurchases unless among other conditions no defaults or events of default are ongoing or would be caused by such restricted payment we were in compliance with all covenants in our outstanding debt instruments for the period ended december 31 2016  

a significant decrease in demand for our services could limit our ability to generate cash flow and could also affect our profitability most of our debt agreements have covenants that require stated levels of financial performance which if not achieved could cause acceleration of the payment schedules as of december 31 2016 we were in compliance with these covenants we do not anticipate a significant decline in business levels or financial performance that would cause us to violate any such covenants in the future and we believe the combination of our existing credit agreement along with our additional borrowing capacity will be sufficient to meet foreseeable seasonal and longterm capital needs 

contractual obligations 

the following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations as of december 31 2016  



  

 

critical accounting policies 

in preparing our financial statements we apply the following critical accounting policies that we believe affect our judgments and estimates of amounts recorded in certain assets liabilities revenue and expenses these critical accounting policies are further described in note 1 of the notes to the financial statements included in item 8 of this report 

revenue recognition 

we recognize revenue based upon when our transportation services have been completed in accordance with the bill of lading contract our general tariff provisions or contractual agreements with our customers generally this occurs when we complete the delivery of a shipment for transportation services not completed at the end of a reporting period we use a percentage of completion method to allocate the appropriate revenue to each separate reporting period under this method we develop a factor for each uncompleted shipment by dividing the actual number of days in transit at the end of a reporting period by that shipment’s standard delivery time schedule this factor is applied to the total revenue for that shipment and revenue is allocated between reporting periods accordingly 

allowances for uncollectible accounts and revenue adjustments 

we maintain an allowance for uncollectible accounts for estimated losses resulting from the failure of our customers to make required payments we estimate this allowance by analyzing the aging of our customer receivables our historical loss experience and other trends and factors affecting the credit risk of our customers we determine customer receivables to be past due when payment has not been received by the invoice due date writeoffs occur when we determine an account to be uncollectible and could differ from our allowance estimate as a result of factors such as changes in the overall economic environment or risks surrounding our customers additional allowances may be required if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments we periodically review the underlying assumptions in our estimate of the allowance for uncollectible accounts to ensure that the allowance reflects the most recent trends and factors 

we also maintain an allowance for estimated revenue adjustments resulting from future billing corrections customer allowances moneyback service guarantees and other miscellaneous revenue adjustments these revenue adjustments are recorded in our revenue from operations we use historical experience trends and current information to update and evaluate these estimates 

claims and insurance accruals 

claims and insurance accruals reflect the estimated cost of claims not covered by insurance for cargo loss and damage bipd workers’ compensation group health and dental the related costs are charged to insurance and claims expense except for workers’ compensation group health and dental which are charged to employee benefits expense 

insurers providing excess coverage above a companys selfinsured retention sir or deductible levels typically adjust their premiums to cover insured losses and for other market factors as a result we periodically evaluate our sir and deductible levels to determine the most costefficient balance between our exposure and excess coverage 

in establishing accruals for claims and expenses we evaluate and monitor each claim individually and we use factors such as historical claims development experience known trends and thirdparty estimates to determine the appropriate reserves for potential liability we believe the assumptions and methods used to estimate these liabilities are reasonable however any changes in the severity of previouslyreported claims significant changes in medical costs and regulatory changes affecting the administration of our plans could significantly impact the determination of appropriate reserves in future periods 

property and equipment 

property and equipment are recorded at cost and depreciated on a straightline basis over their estimated economic lives we use historical experience certain assumptions and estimates in determining the economic life of each asset when indicators of impairment exist we review property and equipment for impairment due to changes in operational and market conditions and we adjust the carrying value and economic life of any impaired asset as appropriate 

estimated economic lives for structures are 7 to 30 years revenue equipment is 4 to 15 years other equipment is 2 to 20 years and leasehold improvements are the lesser of the economic life of the leasehold improvement or the remaining life of the lease the use of different assumptions estimates or significant changes in the resale market for our equipment could result in material changes in the carrying value and related depreciation of our assets 

inflation 

most of our expenses are affected by inflation which typically results in increased operating costs in response to fluctuations in the cost of petroleum products particularly diesel fuel we generally include a fuel surcharge in our tariffs and contractual agreements the fuel surcharge is designed to offset the cost of diesel fuel above a base price and fluctuates as diesel fuel prices change from the base which is generally indexed to the doe’s published fuel prices that reset each week volatility in the price of diesel fuel independent of inflation has impacted our business as described in this report however we do not believe inflation has had a material effect on our results of operations for each of the past three years

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact our financial position results of operations and cash flows due to adverse changes in financial market prices and rates 

we are exposed to interest rate risk directly related to loans if any under our credit agreement which have variable interest rates a 100 basis point increase in the average interest rate on this agreement would have no material effect on our operating results we have established policies and procedures to manage exposure to market risks and use major institutions that we believe are creditworthy to minimize credit risk 

we are exposed to market risk for equity investments relating to companyowned life insurance contracts on certain employees at december 31 2016  the cash value for variable life insurance contracts was 414 million of the 435 million of aggregate cash values for all life insurance contracts included on our balance sheets variable life insurance contracts expose us to fluctuations in equity markets however we utilize a thirdparty to manage these assets and minimize that exposure a 10 change in market value in those investments would have a 41 million impact on our pretax income 

we are exposed to market risk for awards previously granted under our employee and director phantom stock plans the liability for the unsettled outstanding awards is remeasured at the end of each reporting period based on the price of our common stock at december 31 2016  the total liability for unsettled awards granted under these phantom stock plans totaled 390 million  a 10 change in the price of our common stock at december 31 2016  would have had a 39 million impact on our operating income in 2016  with respect to these plans 

we are also exposed to commodity price risk related to diesel fuel prices and manage our exposure to that risk primarily through the application of fuel surcharges to our customers

overview 

we are a leading lessthantruckload “ltl” unionfree motor carrier providing regional interregional and national ltl services which include ground and air expedited transportation and consumer household pickup and delivery through a single integrated organization in addition to our core ltl services we offer a broad range of other valueadded services that include container drayage truckload brokerage supply chain consulting and warehousing our services are complemented by our technological capabilities which we believe provide the tools to improve the efficiency of our operations while empowering our customers to manage their individual shipping needs more than 95 of our revenue has historically been derived from transporting ltl shipments for our customers whose demand for our services is generally tied to industrial production and the overall health of the us domestic economy 

we were the fourth largest ltl motor carrier in the united states as measured by 2014 revenue according to transport topics  we have increased our revenue and customer base over the past five years through organic market share growth our infrastructure allows us to provide nextday and secondday service through each of our six regions covering the continental united states we have added 71 service centers since december 31 2005 12 of which were added during the past five years for a total of 225  at december 31 2015  our investments over the last five years have allowed us to focus on expansion within our service center network which has led to increased density throughout our operations 

we believe the growth in the demand for our services can be attributed to our focus on meeting our customers’ supply chain needs from a single point of contact while providing a superior level of customer service at a fair price our integrated structure allows us to offer our customers consistent highquality service from origin to destination and we believe our operating structure and proprietary information systems enable us to efficiently manage our operating costs 

we were founded in 1934 and incorporated in virginia in 1950 our principal executive offices are located at 500 old dominion way thomasville north carolina 27360 please refer to the balance sheets and statements of operations included in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” in this report for information regarding our total assets revenue from operations and net income 

our industry 

trucking companies provide transportation services to virtually every industry operating in the united states and generally offer higher levels of reliability and faster transit times than other surface transportation options the trucking industry is comprised principally of two types of motor carriers ltl and truckload ltl carriers typically pick up multiple shipments from multiple customers on a single truck and then route that freight for delivery through service centers where the freight may be transferred to other trucks with similar destinations in contrast truckload carriers generally dedicate an entire truck to one customer from origin to destination 

according to the american trucking associations total us transportation revenue in 2014 was 8721 billion of which the trucking industry accounted for 803 the ltl sector had revenue in 2014 of 567 billion which represented 65 of total us transportation revenue in contrast to truckload carriers ltl motor carriers require expansive networks of local pickup and delivery “pd” service centers as well as larger breakbulk or hub facilities significant capital is required to create and maintain a network of service centers and a fleet of tractors and trailers the high fixed costs and capital spending requirements for ltl motor carriers make it difficult for new startup or small operators to effectively compete with established carriers in addition successful ltl motor carriers generally employ and regularly update a high level of technologybased systems and processes that provide information to customers and help reduce operating costs 

the ltl industry is highly competitive on the basis of service and price and has consolidated significantly since the industry was deregulated in 1980 based on 2014 revenue as reported in transport topics  the largest 10 and 25 ltl motor carriers accounted for approximately 49 and 60 respectively of the total ltl market we believe consolidation in our industry will continue due to customer demand for transportation providers offering both national and regional ltl as well as other complementary valueadded services 

competition 

the transportation and logistics industry is intensely competitive and highly fragmented we compete with regional interregional and national ltl carriers and to a lesser extent with truckload carriers small package carriers airfreight carriers and railroads we also compete with and provide transportation services to thirdparty logistics providers that determine both the mode of transportation and the carrier some of our competitors may have a broader global network and a wider range of services than we do we believe competition in our industry is based primarily on service price available capacity and business relationships we believe we are able to gain market share by expanding our capacity and providing highquality service at a fair price 

throughout our organization we continuously seek to improve customer service by maximizing ontime performance and minimizing cargo claims we believe our transit times are generally faster than those of our principal national competitors in part because of our more efficient service center network use of team drivers and proprietary technology in addition we provide greater geographic coverage than most of our regional competitors our diversified mix and scope of regional interregional and national ltl service combined with our valueadded service offerings enables us to provide our customers with a single source to meet their shipping and logistics needs we believe the combination of these factors provide us with a distinct advantage over most of our competitors 

we utilize flexible scheduling and train our employees to perform multiple tasks which we believe allows us to achieve greater productivity and higher levels of customer service than our competitors we believe our focus on employee communication continued education development and motivation strengthens the relationships and trust among our employees 

service center operations 

at december 31 2015  we operated 225  service center locations of which we owned 180  and leased 45  our network includes ten major breakbulk facilities located in rialto california atlanta georgia columbus ohio indianapolis indiana greensboro north carolina harrisburg pennsylvania memphis and morristown tennessee dallas texas and salt lake city utah while using various other service centers for additional limited breakbulk activity in order to serve our nextday markets our service centers are strategically located in six regions of the country so that we can provide the highest quality service and minimize freight rehandling costs 

our service centers are responsible for the pickup and delivery of freight within their local service area each night our service centers load outbound freight for transport to our other service centers for delivery the next business day all inbound freight received by the service center in the evening or during the night is generally scheduled for local delivery the next 

business day unless a customer requests a different delivery schedule our management reviews the productivity and service performance of each service center on a daily basis to ensure quality service and efficient operations 

although we have established primary responsibility for customer service at the local service center level our customers may access information and initiate transactions through our centralized customer service department located at our corporate office or through other electronic gateways our systems offer direct access to information such as freight tracking shipping documents rate quotes rate databases and account activity these centralized systems and our customer service department provide our customers with a single point of contact to access information across all areas of our operations and for each of our service offerings 

linehaul transportation 

linehaul dispatchers control the movement of freight between service centers through integrated freight movement systems we also utilize loadplanning software to optimize efficiencies in our linehaul operations our management team monitors freight movements transit times load factors and many other productivity measurements to help ensure that we maintain our high levels of service and efficiency 

we utilize scheduled routes and additional linehaul dispatches as necessary to meet our published transit times in addition we gain efficiency through the use of twin 28foot trailers in our linehaul operations the use of twin 28foot trailers permits us to transport freight directly from its point of origin to destination with minimal unloading and reloading which also reduces cargo loss and damage expenses we utilize longcombination vehicles such as triple 28foot trailers and combinations of 48foot and 28foot trailers in states where permitted twin trailers and longcombination vehicles permit more freight to be transported behind a tractor than could otherwise be transported by one trailer 

tractors trailers and maintenance 

at december 31 2015  we owned 7688  tractors we generally use new tractors in linehaul operations for approximately three to five years and then transfer those tractors to pd operations for the remainder of their useful lives in many of our service centers tractors perform pd functions during the day and linehaul functions at night to maximize tractor utilization 

the table below reflects as of december 31 2015  the average age of our tractors and trailers 



we develop certain specifications for tractors and trailers and then negotiate the production and purchase of this equipment with several manufacturers these purchases are planned well in advance of anticipated delivery dates in order to accommodate manufacturers’ production schedules we believe there is sufficient capacity among suppliers to ensure an uninterrupted supply of equipment to support our operations 

the table below sets forth our capital expenditures for tractors and trailers for the years ended december 31 2015  2014  and 2013  for more information concerning our capital expenditures see item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations – liquidity and capital resources ” in this report 



at december 31 2015  we operated 38 maintenance centers at strategic service center locations throughout our network these maintenance centers are equipped to perform routine and preventive maintenance and repairs on our equipment 

we adhere to established maintenance policies and procedures to help ensure our fleet is properly maintained tractors are routed to appropriate maintenance facilities at designated mileage intervals or every 90 days whichever occurs first trailers are also scheduled for preventative maintenance every 90 days 

customers 

revenue is generated primarily from customers throughout the united states and north america in 2015  our largest customer accounted for approximately 30 of our revenue and our largest 5 10 and 20 customers accounted for approximately 92 140 and 204 of our revenue respectively for each of the previous three years more than 95 of our revenue was derived from services performed in the united states and less than 5 of our revenue was generated from international services performed we believe the diversity of our customer base helps protect our business from adverse developments in a single geographic region and from the reduction or loss of business from a single customer 

we utilize an integrated freightcosting system to determine the price level at which a particular shipment of freight will be profitable we can modify elements of this freightcosting model to simulate the actual conditions under which the freight will be moved many of our customers engage our services through the terms and provisions of our tariffs and through negotiated service contracts we also compete for business by participating in bid solicitations customers generally solicit bids for relatively large numbers of shipments for a period of one to two years and typically choose to enter into contractual arrangements with a limited number of motor carriers based upon price and service 

seasonality 

our tonnage levels and revenue mix are subject to seasonal trends common in our industry although other factors such as macroeconomic changes could cause variation in these trends operating margins in the first and fourth quarters are typically lower than those during the second and third quarters due to reduced shipments during the winter months harsh winter weather or natural disasters such as hurricanes tornadoes and floods can also adversely impact our performance by reducing demand and increasing operating expenses we believe seasonal trends will continue to impact our business 

technology 

our technology is critical to the success and delivery of the premium service provided by our operations we continually seek to upgrade and enhance our technological capabilities we also provide access to our systems through multiple gateways that offer our customers and employees maximum flexibility and immediate access to information we employ vehicle safety systems onboard and handheld computer systems freight handling systems and logistics technology to reduce costs and transit times our data systems are integrated in every level within our organization which we believe is also critical to our success our systems are protected through physical and software safeguards as well as redundant systems network security measures and backup systems we continue to focus on the development and enhancement of the technology used in our operations in order to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of our services 

insurance 

we carry a significant amount of insurance with thirdparty insurance carriers but we are exposed to the risk of loss on claims up to the limit for which we hold either a selfinsured retention sir or deductible at december 31 2015  the amounts of our sir andor deductibles were as follows 275 million per occurrence for bodily injury and property damage “bipd” claims 100000 per claim for cargo loss and damage 10 million per occurrence for workers’ compensation claims and 500000 per occurrence with a 400000 aggregate over our retention level for group health claims 

we believe that our policy of maintaining an sir or deductible for a portion of our risks supported by our safety and loss prevention programs is an effective means of managing insurance costs we periodically review our risk exposure and insurance coverage applicable to those risks and we believe that we maintain sufficient insurance coverage 

diesel fuel availability and cost 

we depend heavily upon the availability and quality of diesel fuel to provide our transportation services we maintain fuel storage and pumping facilities at certain service center locations as the primary source for fueling our fleet and we utilize overtheroad fueling options at retail locations as necessary we could be susceptible to regional andor national fuel shortages which could cause us to incur additional expense in order to obtain an adequate supply within our own fueling network or cause us to rely more heavily on higherpriced retail fuel 

we believe our operations and financial condition are susceptible to the same diesel fuel price increases or shortages as those of our competitors we implemented a fuel surcharge program in august 1999 which has remained in effect since that time and is one of many components that we use to determine the overall price for our transportation services our fuel surcharges are generally indexed to fuel prices published by the us department of energy the “doe” that reset each week 

employees 

as of december 31 2015  we employed 17931  individuals on a fulltime basis none of which were represented under a collective bargaining agreement our fulltime employees work in the following roles 



as of december 31 2015  we employed 4903 linehaul drivers and 4577 pd drivers on a fulltime basis we select our drivers primarily based upon safe driving records and experience among other requirements our drivers must pass a drug test have a current us department of transportation “dot” physical and have a valid commercial driver’s license prior to employment once employed drivers are required to obtain and maintain hazardous materials endorsements to their commercial driver’s licenses drivers like all of our employees are required to take preemployment drug and alcohol tests and are randomly selected for periodic additional testing 

since 1988 we have provided the opportunity for qualified employees to become drivers through the “old dominion driver training program” there are currently 2601 active drivers who have successfully completed this training which was approximately 27 of our driver workforce as of december 31 2015  we believe our driver training and qualification programs have been important factors in improving our safety record and retaining qualified drivers in addition we have experienced an annual turnover rate for our driver graduates of approximately 54 which is below our companywide turnover rate for all drivers of approximately 103 

we reward our drivers who maintain safe driving records with annual bonuses of up to 3000 per driver our driver safety bonuses totaled 34 million 31 million and 28 million in 2015  2014  and 2013  respectively 

governmental regulation 

we are regulated by the dot and by various state agencies these regulatory authorities have broad powers generally governing matters such as authority to engage in motor carrier operations as well as motor carrier registration driver hours of service safety and fitness of transportation equipment and drivers transportation of hazardous materials certain mergers and acquisitions and periodic financial reporting the trucking industry is also subject to regulatory and legislative changes from a variety of other governmental authorities which address matters such as increasingly stringent environmental occupational safety and health regulations limits on vehicle weight and size ergonomics port security and hours of service in addition we are subject to compliance with cargosecurity and transportation regulations issued by the transportation security administration tsa and customs and border protection cbp within the us department of homeland security regulatory requirements and changes in regulatory requirements may affect our business or the economics of the industry by requiring changes in operating practices or by influencing the demand for and increasing the costs of providing transportation services 

in october 2009 the us court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit ordered the federal motor carrier safety administration the fmcsa to review and reissue rules governing hours of service for commercial truck drivers on december 22 2011 the fmcsa issued its final rule which mandated compliance by july 1 2013 the 2011 rule reduced the maximum number of hours a truck driver could work each week to 70 hours from the former 82hour limit the 2011 rule maintained the maximum 11hour daily driving limit but required drivers to take a 30minute break prior to working beyond eight hours the 2011 rule also modified the “34hour restart” provision to include two periods of rest between 1 am and 5 am and limited a restart to once every 168 hours on december 16 2014 however the 2015 omnibus appropriations bill temporarily suspended enforcement of certain aspects of the restart provisions until september 30 2015 specifically the new law temporarily eliminated the requirements for two rest periods between 1 am and 5 am and the 168hour minimum restart 

provision the law directed the secretary of the dot to conduct a field study of the operational safety health and fatigue aspects of the restart provisions in effect before and after july 1 2013 the dot completed the field study within the mandated september 30 2015 deadline and submitted its findings to the office of the inspector general for review results and conclusions from this study have not been submitted to congress or released publicly therefore certain aspects of the restart provisions remain temporarily suspended 

implementation of the 2011 rule on july 1 2013 required us to make certain changes in our operating procedures these changes increased our operating costs by limiting the productivity of our drivers while the suspension of certain aspects of the restart provisions has allowed us to regain some of this lost productivity the suspension is temporary and our operating costs could be adversely impacted when final rules are implemented 

on december 16 2015 the fmcsa issued final rules to mandate the use of electronic logging devices “elds” to automatically record driving time for hours of service reporting generally carriers must comply with these new requirements by december 18 2017 we currently utilize elds in all of our companyowned vehicles and do not believe this new requirement will have a significant impact on our operations 

we are subject to future rulemaking by the fmcsa and other regulatory agencies which could be more stringent require additional changes to our operations increase our operating costs or otherwise adversely impact our results of operations 

environmental regulation 

we are subject to various federal state and local environmental laws and regulations that focus on among other things the emission and discharge of hazardous materials into the environment or their presence at our properties or in our vehicles fuel storage tanks transportation of certain materials and the discharge or retention of storm water under specific environmental laws we could also be held responsible for any costs relating to contamination at our past or present facilities and at thirdparty waste disposal sites as well as costs associated with cleanup of accidents involving our vehicles we do not believe that the cost of future compliance with current environmental laws or regulations will have a material adverse effect on our operations financial condition competitive position or capital expenditures for the remainder of 2016  or fiscal year 2017 however future changes to laws or regulations may adversely affect our operations and could result in unforeseen costs to our business

 item 1a risk factors 

various factors exist that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those projected in any forwardlooking statement in addition to the factors discussed elsewhere in this report we believe the following are some of the important risks and uncertainties that could materially affect our business financial condition or results of operations 

we operate in a highly competitive industry and our business will suffer if we are unable to adequately address potential downward pricing pressures and other factors that may adversely affect our operations and profitability 

numerous competitive factors could impair our ability to maintain our current profitability these factors include but are not limited to the following 

 

 

if we are unable to effectively compete with other ltl carriers whether on the basis of price service or otherwise we may be unable to retain existing customers or attract new customers either of which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations furthermore continued merger and acquisition activity in transportation and logistics could result in stronger or new competitors which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations we may not be able to compete successfully in an increasingly consolidated ltl industry and cannot predict with certainty how industry consolidation will affect our competitors or us 

if our employees were to unionize our operating costs would increase and our ability to compete would be impaired 

none of our employees are currently represented under a collective bargaining agreement however from time to time there have been efforts to organize our employees at various service centers further congress or one or more states could approve legislation andor the national labor relations board could render decisions or implement rule changes that could significantly affect our business and our relationship with our employees including actions that could substantially liberalize the procedures for union organization in addition we can offer no assurance that the department of labor will not adopt new regulations or interpret existing regulations in a manner that would favor the agenda of unions or that our employees will not unionize in the future particularly if regulatory changes occur that facilitate unionization 

the unionization of our employees could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations because 

 

if we are unable to successfully execute our growth strategy our business and future results of operations may suffer 

our growth strategy includes increasing the volume of freight moving through our existing service center network selectively expanding our capacity and broadening the scope of our service offerings in connection with our growth strategy at various times we have expanded and upgraded service centers purchased additional equipment and increased our sales and marketing efforts and we expect to continue to do so our growth strategy exposes us to a number of risks including the following 

 

we cannot assure that we will overcome the risks associated with our growth strategy if we fail to overcome those risks we may not realize additional revenue or profits from our efforts we may incur additional expenses and therefore our financial position and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 

we may be unable to successfully consummate and integrate acquisitions as part of our growth strategy 

although we have not completed an acquisition since 2008 growth through acquisitions has been a key component of our ltl growth strategy throughout our history in the future we may seek to acquire other ltl carriers as well as other complementary businesses exploration of potential acquisitions requires significant attention from our management team in addition we expect to compete for acquisition opportunities with other companies some of which may have greater financial and other resources than we do we cannot ensure that we will have sufficient cash to consummate an acquisition or otherwise be able to obtain financing for any acquisition if we are unable to access sufficient funding for potential acquisitions we may not be able to complete transactions that we otherwise find advantageous 

any subsequent acquisition will entail numerous risks including 

 

in addition we may have difficulty integrating any acquired business and its operations services and personnel into our existing operations and such integration may require a significant amount of time and effort by our management team to the extent we do not successfully avoid or overcome the risks or problems resulting from any acquisitions we undertake there could be a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our customers’ and suppliers’ businesses may be impacted by a downturn in the economy andor a disruption of financial markets which may decrease demand for our services 

adverse economic conditions can negatively affect our customers’ business levels the amount of transportation services they need their ability to pay for our services and overall freight levels any of which might impair our asset utilization customers encountering adverse economic conditions may be unable to obtain additional financing or financing under acceptable terms due to disruptions in the capital and credit markets these customers represent a greater potential for bad debt losses which may require us to increase our reserve for bad debt economic conditions resulting in bankruptcies of one or more of our large customers could have a significant impact on our financial position results of operations or liquidity in a particular year or quarter further when adverse economic times arise customers may select competitors that offer lower rates in an attempt to lower their costs and we might be forced to lower our rates or lose freight 

our suppliers’ business levels also may be negatively affected by adverse economic conditions or financial constraints which could lead to disruptions in the supply and availability of equipment parts and services critical to our operations a significant interruption in our normal supply chain could disrupt our operations increase our costs and negatively impact our ability to serve our customers 

we also are subject to cost increases outside of our control that could materially reduce our profitability if we are unable to increase our rates sufficiently such cost increases include but are not limited to increases in fuel prices interest rates taxes tolls license and registration fees insurance revenue equipment and healthcare for our employees 

difficulties attracting and retaining qualified drivers could result in increases in driver compensation and could adversely affect our profitability our ability to maintain or grow our fleet and our ability to maintain our customer relationships 

from time to time we have experienced difficulty in attracting and retaining sufficient numbers of qualified drivers and such shortages may recur in the future due in part to the time commitment physical requirements our stringent company hiring standards and current industry conditions the available pool of qualified employee drivers has been declining because of the intense competition for drivers we may face difficulty maintaining or increasing our number of drivers the compensation we offer our drivers is subject to market conditions that may require increases in driver compensation if we are unable to attract and retain a sufficient number of qualified drivers we could be required to adjust our compensation packages amend our hiring standards or operate with fewer trucks and face difficulty meeting customer demands any of which could adversely affect our growth and profitability 

the fmcsa’s csa initiative could adversely impact our ability to hire qualified drivers meet our growth projections and maintain our customer relationships each of which could adversely impact our results of operations 

the fmcsa’s compliance safety accountability initiative csa is an enforcement and compliance program designed to monitor and improve commercial motor vehicle safety by measuring the safety record of both the motor carrier and the driver these measurements are scored and used by the fmcsa to identify potential safety risks and to direct enforcement action 

our csa scores are dependent upon our safety and compliance experience which could change at any time in addition the safety standards prescribed in csa could change and our ability to maintain an acceptable score could be adversely impacted public disclosure of certain csa scores was restricted through the enactment of the fixing america’s surface transportation act of 2015 the “fast act” on december 4 2015 however the fast act does not restrict public disclosure of all data collected by the fmcsa if we receive unacceptable csa scores and this data is made available to the public our relationships with our customers could be damaged which could result in a loss of business 

the requirements of csa could also shrink the industry’s pool of drivers as those with unfavorable scores could leave the industry as a result the costs to attract train and retain qualified drivers could increase in addition a shortage of qualified drivers could increase driver turnover decrease asset utilization limit growth and adversely impact our results of operations 

insurance and claims expenses could significantly reduce our profitability 

we are exposed to claims related to cargo loss and damage property damage personal injury workers’ compensation group health and group dental we have insurance coverage with thirdparty insurance carriers but we assume a significant portion of the risk associated with these claims due to our sirs and deductibles our operating results would be adversely affected if any of the following were to occur i the number or the severity of claims increases ii we are required to accrue or pay additional amounts because the claims prove to be more severe than our original assessment or iii claims exceed our excess coverage amounts if claims exceed our sir or deductible levels insurance companies exit the transportation insurance marketplace or insurance market conditions change insurers could raise premiums for excess coverage to cover their expenses and anticipated future losses in addition insurance companies generally require us to collateralize our sir or deductible levels if these collateralization requirements increase our borrowing capacity could be adversely affected 

healthcare legislation may increase our costs and reduce our future profitability 

to attract and retain employees we maintain a competitive health insurance plan for our employees and their dependents we cannot predict the impact that any state or federal healthcare legislation or regulation will have on our operations but we expect costs associated with providing benefits under employee medical plans and healthcarerelated costs associated with workers compensation to continue to increase rising healthcare costs in the united states could result in significant longterm costs to us which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results in addition rising healthcare costs could force us to make further changes to our benefits program which could negatively impact our ability to attract and retain employees 

we have significant ongoing cash requirements that could limit our growth and affect our profitability if we are unable to obtain sufficient capital 

our business is highly capital intensive we generally finance our capital expenditures and planned growth with existing cash cash flow from operations issuance of debt and through available borrowings under our existing senior unsecured credit agreement we may require additional capital to finance longterm real estate purchase opportunities and acquisitions which we may fund through additional debt or through equity offerings if we are unable in the future to generate sufficient cash from our operations or raise capital by accessing the debt and equity markets we may be forced to limit our growth and operate our equipment for longer periods of time which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results 

our business also has significant ongoing operating cash requirements if our cash requirements are high or our cash flow from operations is low during particular periods we may need to seek additional financing which could be costly or difficult to obtain 

limited supply and increased costs of new equipment may adversely affect our earnings and cash flow 

we may face difficulty in purchasing new equipment due to decreased supply and increased costs investment in new equipment is a significant part of our annual capital expenditures and we require an available supply of tractors and trailers from equipment manufacturers to operate and grow our business we may also be subject to shortages in raw materials that are required for the production of critical operating equipment and supplies such as shortages in rubber or steel 

the price of our equipment may also be adversely affected in the future by regulations on newly manufactured tractors and diesel engines we are subject to regulations issued by the us environmental protection agency the “epa” and various state agencies that have required progressive reductions in exhaust emissions from diesel engines these regulations have resulted in higher prices for tractors and diesel engines and increased operating and maintenance costs and there can be no assurance that continued increases in pricing or costs will not have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

we may be adversely impacted by fluctuations in the availability and price of diesel fuel 

diesel fuel is a critical component of our operations and a significant operating expense for our business despite the recent decline in diesel fuel prices future increases in such prices and decreases in diesel fuel availability could have a material adverse effect on our operating results diesel fuel prices and fuel availability can be impacted by factors beyond our control such as natural or manmade disasters adverse weather conditions political events disruption or failure of technology or information systems price and supply decisions by oil producing countries and cartels terrorist activities armed conflict and world supply and demand imbalances we maintain fuel storage and pumping facilities at many of our service center locations however we may be susceptible to fuel shortages at certain locations that could cause us to incur additional expense to ensure adequate supply on a timely basis and to prevent a disruption to our service schedules an interruption in the supply of diesel fuel could have a material adverse effect on our operating results 

we do not hedge against the risk of diesel fuel price increases an increase in diesel fuel prices or diesel fuel taxes or any change in federal or state regulations that results in such an increase could have a material adverse effect on our operating results we have fuel surcharge programs in place with a majority of our customers which help offset the negative impact of the increased cost of diesel fuel and other petroleumbased products however we also incur fuel costs that cannot be recovered even with respect to customers with which we maintain fuel surcharge programs such as those costs associated with empty miles or the time when our engines are idling because our fuel surcharge recovery lags behind changes in fuel prices our fuel surcharge recovery may not capture the increased costs we pay for fuel especially when prices are rising leading to fluctuations in our levels of reimbursement we regularly monitor the components of our pricing including fuel surcharges and address individual account profitability issues with our customers when necessary however there can be no assurance that fuel surcharges can be maintained indefinitely or will be sufficiently effective in offsetting increases in diesel fuel prices 

we are subject to various environmental laws and regulations and costs of compliance with liabilities under or violations of existing or future environmental laws or regulations could adversely affect our business 

we are subject to various federal state and local environmental laws and regulations that govern among other things the emission and discharge of hazardous materials into the environment the presence of hazardous materials at our properties or in our vehicles fuel storage tanks the transportation of certain materials and the discharge or retention of storm water under certain environmental laws we could also be held responsible for any costs relating to contamination at our past or present facilities and at thirdparty waste disposal sites as well as costs associated with the cleanup of accidents involving our vehicles environmental laws have become and are expected to continue to be increasingly more stringent over time and there can be no assurance that our costs of complying with current or future environmental laws or liabilities arising under such laws will not have a material adverse effect on our business operations or financial condition 

in addition to the epa regulations on exhaust emissions with which we must comply there is an increased regulatory focus on climate change and greenhouse gas emissions in the united states we are also subject to increasing sensitivity to sustainability issues this increased focus on sustainability may result in new regulations andor customer requirements that could adversely impact our business any future limitations on the emission of greenhouse gases other environmental legislation or customer sustainability requirements could increase our future capital expenditures and have an adverse impact on our financial condition results of operations and liquidity 

we are subject to the risks of litigation and governmental proceedings which could adversely affect our business 

the nature of our business exposes us to the potential for various claims and litigation related to labor and employment personal injury property damage cargo claims safety and contract compliance environmental liability and other matters accordingly we are and in the future may be subject to legal proceedings and claims that have arisen in the ordinary course of our business and may include classaction allegations we are also subject to potential governmental proceedings and claims the parties in such legal actions may seek amounts from us that may not be covered in whole or in part by insurance defending ourselves against such legal actions could result in significant costs and could require a substantial amount of time and effort by our management team we cannot predict the outcome of litigation or governmental proceedings to which we are a party or whether we will be subject to future legal actions as a result the potential costs associated with legal actions against us could adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations 

we are subject to various risks arising from our international business operations and relationships which could adversely affect our business 

we arrange for transportation and logistics services to and from various international locations and are subject to both the risks of conducting international business and the requirements of the foreign corrupt practices act of 1977 the fcpa failure to comply with the fcpa may result in legal claims against us in addition we face other risks associated with international operations and relationships which may include restrictive trade policies imposition of duties taxes or government royalties imposed by foreign governments 

we operate in a highly regulated industry and increased costs of compliance with or liability for violation of existing or future regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business 

we are regulated by the dot and by various state agencies these regulatory authorities have broad powers generally governing matters such as authority to engage in motor carrier operations as well as motor carrier registration driver hours of service safety and fitness of transportation equipment and drivers transportation of hazardous materials certain mergers and acquisitions and periodic financial reporting the trucking industry is also subject to regulatory and legislative changes from a variety of other governmental authorities which address matters such as increasingly stringent environmental occupational safety and health regulations limits on vehicle weight and size ergonomics port security and hours of service in addition we are subject to compliance with cargosecurity and transportation regulations issued by the tsa and cbp within the us department of homeland security regulatory requirements and changes in regulatory requirements may affect our business or the economics of the industry by requiring changes in operating practices or by influencing the demand for and increasing the costs of providing transportation services 

our results of operations may be affected by seasonal factors harsh weather conditions and disasters 

our operations are subject to seasonal trends common in our industry our operating margins in the first and fourth quarters are typically lower than those during the second and third quarters due to reduced shipments during the winter months harsh weather and disaster whether natural or manmade can also adversely affect our performance by reducing demand and reducing our ability to transport freight which could result in decreased revenue and increased operating expenses 

if we are unable to retain our key employees or if we do not effectively execute our succession plan our financial condition results of operations and liquidity could be adversely affected 

our success will continue to depend upon the experience and leadership of our key employees and executive officers in that regard the loss of the services of any of our key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and liquidity if we are unable to secure replacement personnel that have sufficient experience in our industry and in the management of our business if we are unable to continue to develop and retain a core group of management personnel and execute succession planning strategies or we encounter any unforeseen difficulties associated with the recent transition of members of our management team our business could be negatively impacted in the future 

our principal shareholders control a large portion of our outstanding common stock 

earl e congdon david s congdon john r congdon jr and members of their respective families beneficially own an aggregate of approximately 25 of the outstanding shares of our common stock as long as the congdon family controls a large portion of our voting stock they may be able to significantly influence the election of the entire board of directors and the outcome of all matters involving a shareholder vote the congdon family’s interests may differ from the interests of other shareholders and the status of their ownership could change at their discretion 

our financial results may be adversely impacted by potential future changes in accounting practices 

future changes in accounting standards or practices and related legal and regulatory interpretations of those changes may adversely impact public companies in general the transportation industry or our operations specifically new accounting standards or requirements could change the way we record revenues expenses assets andor liabilities or could be costly to implement these types of regulations could have a negative impact on our financial position liquidity results of operations andor access to capital 

our information technology systems are subject to cyber and other risks some of which are beyond our control which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial position 

we are reliant on the proper functioning and availability of our information systems for our operations as well as providing a valueadded service to our customers our information systems including our accounting communications and data processing systems are integral to the efficient operation of our business it is critical that the data processed by these systems remain confidential as it often includes competitive customer information confidential customer credit card and transaction data employee records and key financial and operational results and statistics cyber incidents that impact the security availability reliability speed accuracy or other proper functioning of these systems and measures including outages computer viruses breakins and similar disruptions could have a significant impact on our operations we utilize thirdparty service providers who have access to our systems and certain sensitive data which exposes us to additional security risks although our information systems are protected through physical and software safeguards as well as redundant systems network security measures and backup systems it is not practicable to protect against the possibility of power loss telecommunications failures cybersecurity attacks and other cyber incidents in every potential circumstance that may arise a significant cyber incident including system failure security breach disruption by malware or other damage could interrupt or delay our operations damage our reputation cause a loss of customers expose us to a risk of loss or litigation andor cause us to incur significant time and expense to remedy such an event any of which could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial position 

we rely heavily on information technology systems and any disruption to our technology infrastructure or failures of essential services upon which our information technology platforms rely could cause us to incur costs or result in a loss of business which may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

our information technology systems are complex and require ongoing investments and enhancements to meet both internal requirements and the requirements of our customers our information technology systems also depend upon the internet thirdparty service providers global communications providers satellitebased communications systems the electric utilities grid electric utility providers and telecommunications providers we have no control over the operation quality or maintenance of these services or whether vendors will improve their services or continue to provide services that are essential to our business disruptions due to transitional challenges in upgrading or enhancing our technology systems or failures in the services upon which our information technology platforms rely which may arise from adverse weather conditions or natural calamities such as floods hurricanes earthquakes or tornadoes illegal acts including terrorist attacks human error or systems modernization initiatives andor other disruptions may adversely affect the services we provide which could increase our costs or result in a loss of customers that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position 

damage to our reputation through unfavorable publicity could adversely affect our financial condition 

in the current environment of instantaneous communication and social media outlets the quick and broad dissemination of information through media sources could cause damaging information about us whether accurate or not to be broadly publicized unfavorable publicity about the company or our employees could damage our reputation and may result in a reduction in demand for our services or the loss of customers that could have a negative impact on our financial condition results of operations and liquidity this unfavorable publicity could also require the need to allocate significant resources to the rebuilding of our reputation 

antiterrorism measures may disrupt our business 

federal state and municipal authorities have implemented and are continuing to implement various antiterrorism measures including checkpoints and travel restrictions on large trucks if additional security measures disrupt or impede the timing of our deliveries we may fail to meet the requirements of our customers or incur increased expenses to do so there can be no assurance that new antiterrorism measures will not be implemented and that such measures will not have a material adverse effect on our operations 

a decrease in the demand and value of used equipment may impact our results of operations 

as we purchase new tractors and trailers as part of our normal replacement cycle each year we rely on the used equipment market to dispose of our older equipment oversupply in the transportation industry as well as adverse domestic and foreign economic conditions can negatively impact the demand for used equipment and therefore reduce the value we can obtain on our used equipment if we are unable to sell our older equipment at or above our salvage value the resulting losses could have a significant impact on our results of operations 

if we raise additional capital in the future your ownership in us could be diluted 

any issuance of equity we may undertake in the future to raise additional capital could cause the price of our common stock to decline or require us to issue shares at a price that is lower than that paid by holders of our common stock in the past which would result in those newly issued shares being dilutive if we obtain funds through a credit facility or through the issuance of debt or preferred securities these obligations and securities would likely have rights senior to your rights as a common shareholder which could impair the value of our common stock 

the market value of our common stock may fluctuate and could be substantially affected by various factors 

the price of our common stock on the nasdaq global select market constantly changes we expect that the market price of our common stock will continue to fluctuate as a result of a variety of factors many of which are beyond our control these factors include among others 

 

our common stock price may fluctuate significantly in the future and these fluctuations may be unrelated to our performance general market price declines or market volatility in the future could adversely affect the price of our common stock and the current market price of our common stock may not be indicative of future market prices 

our articles of incorporation our bylaws and virginia law contain provisions that could discourage delay or prevent a change in our control or our management 

provisions of our articles of incorporation bylaws and the laws of virginia the state in which we are incorporated may discourage delay or prevent a change in control of us or a change in management that shareholders may consider favorable these provisions 

 

these provisions could discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for you and other shareholders to take certain corporate actions these provisions could also limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock

 item 2 properties 

we own our principal executive office located in thomasville north carolina consisting of a twostory office building of approximately 168000 square feet on 318 acres of land at december 31 2015  we operated 225  service centers of which 180  were owned and 45  were leased our owned service centers include most of our larger facilities and account for approximately 90 of the total door capacity in our network we own each of our major breakbulk facilities listed below and have provided the number of doors as of december 31 2015  



our 225  facilities are strategically dispersed over the states in which we operate at december 31 2015  the terms of our leased properties ranged from monthtomonth to a lease that expires in 2039 we believe that as current leases expire we will be able to renew them or find comparable facilities without incurring any material negative impact on service to our customers or our operating results 

we also own eight nonoperating service center properties three of these properties are leased to third parties with lease terms that range from monthtomonth to a lease that expires in 2036

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

overview 

we are a leading lessthantruckload “ltl” unionfree motor carrier providing regional interregional and national ltl services which include ground and air expedited transportation and consumer household pickup and delivery through a single integrated organization in addition to our core ltl services we offer a broad range of valueadded services including container drayage truckload brokerage supply chain consulting and warehousing more than 95 of our revenue has historically been derived from transporting ltl shipments for our customers whose demand for our services is generally tied to industrial production and the overall health of the us domestic economy 

in analyzing the components of our revenue we monitor changes and trends in our ltl services using the following key metrics which exclude certain transportation and logistics services where pricing is generally not determined by weight commodity or distance 

 

revenue per hundredweight is a commonlyused indicator of pricing trends but this metric can be influenced by other factors such as changes in fuel surcharges weight per shipment length of haul and the class or mix of our freight as a result changes in revenue per hundredweight do not necessarily indicate actual changes in underlying base rates 

 

 

our primary revenue focus is to increase “density” which is shipment and tonnage growth within our existing infrastructure increases in density allow us to maximize our asset utilization and labor productivity which we measure over many different functional areas of our operations including linehaul load factor pickup and delivery “pd” stops per hour pd shipments per hour platform pounds handled per hour and platform shipments per hour in addition to our focus on density and operating efficiencies it is critical for us to obtain an appropriate yield on the shipments we handle we manage our yields by focusing on individual account profitability we believe yield management and improvements in efficiency are key components in our ability to produce profitable growth 

our primary cost elements are direct wages and benefits associated with the movement of freight operating supplies and expenses which include diesel fuel and depreciation of our equipment fleet and service center facilities we gauge our overall success in managing costs by monitoring our operating ratio a measure of profitability calculated by dividing total operating expenses by revenue which also allows for industrywide comparisons with our competitors 

we continually upgrade our technological capabilities to improve our customer service and lower our operating costs our technology provides our customers with visibility of their shipments throughout our network increases the productivity of our workforce and provides key metrics that we use to monitor and enhance our processes 

results of operations 

the following table sets forth for the years indicated expenses and other items as a percentage of revenue from operations 



  

   

2015  compared to 2014   

key financial and operating metrics for 2015  and 2014  are presented below 



in 2015 we produced revenue growth of 66 increased net income by 139 and increased diluted earnings per diluted share by 152 these results were achieved during a period of general softening in the domestic economic environment we believe our revenue growth was primarily driven by an increase in tonnage attributable to winning additional market share as our new and existing customers increasingly respond to the value of our premium service our tonnage growth resulted from an increase in shipments which was partially offset by the decline in weight per shipment we believe our longterm strategy of providing industryleading service continues to drive our market share growth while also allowing us to remain committed to our disciplined yield management process 

our tonnage growth during 2015 led to increased density within our freight movement operations and service center network the additional freight density and our focus on operational efficiency led to productivity improvements in both of our platform and pd operations these improvements when combined with our disciplined yield management process generated a 100 basispoint improvement in our operating ratio in 2015 which represents the sixth consecutive year that our operating ratio has improved at least 100 basis points as a result our net income and earnings per diluted share in 2015 were 3047 million and 357 respectively 

revenue 

our revenue in 2015 increased 1845 million or 66 as compared to 2014 ltl tonnage increased 74 primarily due to the 116 increase in ltl shipments although our tonnage growth was affected by a 38 decrease in weight per shipment we attribute the decline in weight per shipment in 2015 to softening economic conditions and changes in the mix of our freight 

ltl revenue per hundredweight decreased 05 to 1823 in 2015 primarily due to declines in our fuel surcharges ltl revenue per hundredweight excluding fuel surcharges increased 57 in 2015 as compared to 2014 which includes the positive effect on this metric from a decrease in weight per shipment we believe the increase in revenue per hundredweight excluding fuel surcharges reflects our continued commitment to a disciplined yield management process and a relatively stable pricing environment 

most of our tariffs and contracts provide for a fuel surcharge that is generally indexed to the us department of energys doe published diesel fuel prices that reset each week our fuel surcharges are designed to offset fluctuations in the cost of petroleumbased products and are one of the many components included in the overall negotiated price we charge for our services fuel surcharge revenue decreased to 104 of revenue in 2015 from 155 in 2014 primarily due to a decrease in the average price per gallon for diesel fuel for those comparative periods we regularly monitor the components of our pricing including base freight rates and fuel surcharges and our costs at the customer level we address individual customer profitability issues to minimize the negative impact on our profitability that would likely result from a rapid and significant change in any of our operating expenses 

operating costs and other expenses 

salaries wages and benefits increased 1885 million or 136 in 2015 due to a 1436 million increase in salaries and wages and a 449 million increase in benefit costs the increase in salaries and wages excluding benefits was primarily due to an increase in the average number of fulltime employees of 2063 or 135 over 2014 as well as annual wage increases provided to our employees in september of 2014 and 2015 the increase in fulltime employees was necessary to provide capacity for the increase in shipments during the year we also implemented certain operational initiatives that decreased our reliance on purchased transportation providers and increased our utilization of company employees and equipment the additional freight density contributed to a slight improvement in our pd and platform shipments per hour which improved 11 and 18 respectively from 2014 our aggregate productive labor costs increased to 279 of revenue in 2015 as compared to 258 in 2014 while our other salaries and wages increased to 119 of revenue in 2015 as compared to 115 in 2014 

employee benefit costs increased 449 million or 132 primarily due to an increase in the number of fulltime employees eligible for benefits certain enhancements to paidtimeoff benefits and an increase in our workers compensation expense these increases were partially offset by a reduction in expense for certain retirement benefit plans directly linked to the share price of our common stock in the fourth quarter of 2015 our group health costs increased and we anticipate this trend to continue into 2016 employee benefit costs in 2015 were 326 of salaries and wages as compared to 328 in 2014 

operating supplies and expenses decreased 788 million in 2015 as compared to 2014 the cost of diesel fuel excluding fuel taxes represents the largest component of operating supplies and expenses and can vary based on both average price per gallon and consumption our diesel fuel costs decreased primarily due to a 337 decrease in our average cost per gallon during 2015 as compared to the prior year this decrease was partially offset by an increase in fuel consumption of 91 primarily due to an 116 increase in linehaul and pd miles driven our fuel consumption benefited from an overall improvement in miles per gallon which continues to improve as we add newer more fuelefficient equipment to our operations the additional fuel consumption resulted in an increase in fuel taxes which increased our operating taxes and licenses we do not use diesel fuel hedging instruments and are therefore subject to market price fluctuations other operating supplies and expenses excluding diesel fuel remained relatively consistent as a percent of revenue between the periods compared 

depreciation and amortization expenses increased 189 million primarily due to the assets acquired through our 2015 and 2014 capital expenditures as a percent of revenue our depreciation and amortization expense increased to 56 in 2015 compared to 53 in 2014 while our investments in real estate equipment and technology can increase our costs we believe these investments are necessary to support our continued growth and strategic initiatives 

purchased transportation expense decreased 130 million or 101 in 2015 as compared to 2014 we primarily utilized purchased transportation services from thirdparty providers to support our container drayage international freightforwarding and truckload brokerage services we also utilized purchased transportation to perform limited pd services in our ltl operations the decrease in purchased transportation was primarily due to operational improvement initiatives to reduce our use of thirdparty providers for the movement of our customers’ shipments 

our effective tax rate in 2015 was 378  as compared to 381  in 2014 our effective tax rates in 2015 and 2014 were favorably impacted by various tax credits including credits for the use of alternative fuel in our operations our effective tax rate generally exceeds the federal statutory rate of 35 due to the impact of state taxes and to a lesser extent certain other nondeductible items 

2014  compared to 2013   

key financial and operating metrics for 2014  and 2013  are presented below 



our 2014 financial results reflected strong increases in revenue net income and earnings per diluted share our revenue increased 193 to 279 billion and our operating ratio improved by 130 basis points to 842 which represented the fifth consecutive year that our operating ratio has improved by more than 100 basis points as a result our net income increased 298 from the prioryear period to 2675 million in 2014 

our revenue growth in 2014 was driven by a 169 increase in ltl tons combined with a 21 increase in revenue per hundredweight our tonnage growth was primarily the result of market share gains from new and existing customers that desire the value of superior service at a fair price this growth increased density throughout our operations which contributed to our improved profitability for the year our growth has required continuous and significant investments in our service center network equipment technology and employees as a result our capital expenditures were 3677 million in 2014 and were even higher in 2015 in addition we added 2370 fulltime employees in 2014 which included an increase in our total number of drivers of 1253 or 168 we believe these investments provided the additional capacity needed to meet demand and positioned us well for anticipated future growth

our revenue increased 4502 million or 193 during 2014 which was a result of increases in both ltl tonnage and yield ltl tonnage increased 169 primarily due to the 142 increase in ltl shipments and a 23 increase in weight per shipment we believe that our tonnage growth in 2014 was primarily due to further market share gains from our existing customers the addition of new customers and the general improvement in the domestic economy 

ltl revenue per hundredweight increased 21 to 1833 in 2014 despite declines in fuel surcharge rates the decrease in length of haul and the increase in weight per shipment each of which generally has the effect of lowering this metric ltl revenue per hundredweight excluding fuel surcharges increased 28 in 2014 as compared to 2013 we believe the increase in revenue per hundredweight reflected our disciplined yield management process and a favorable pricing environment that resulted from general capacity constraints in the ltl industry 

our fuel surcharges are designed to offset fluctuations in the cost of petroleumbased products and are one of the many components included in the overall negotiated price we charge for our services fuel surcharge revenue decreased to 155 of revenue in 2014 from 161 in 2013 primarily due to a decrease in the average price per gallon for diesel fuel for those comparative periods most of our tariffs and contracts provide for a fuel surcharge that is generally indexed to the does published diesel fuel prices that reset each week fluctuations in fuel surcharges between the periods are primarily the result of changes in the underlying price of diesel fuel we regularly monitor the components of our pricing including base freight rates and fuel surcharges we also address any individual account profitability issues with our customers as part of our effort to minimize the negative impact on our profitability that would likely result from a rapid and significant change in any of our operating expenses 

operating costs and other expenses 

salaries wages and benefits increased 2105 million or 180 in 2014 due to a 1704 million increase in salaries and wages and a 401 million increase in benefit costs the increases in salaries and wages excluding benefits were primarily due to the 135 increase in the average number of fulltime employees over 2013 and the annual wage increases in 2013 and 2014 the increase in employees primarily related to our productive labor workforce which was necessary to keep pace with our increased volumes during the year in addition to the increase in employees our costs were also impacted by a productivity decline in our platform operations that increased these costs as a percent of revenue our aggregate productive labor costs increased to 258 of revenue in 2014 as compared to 255 in 2013 while our other salaries and wages improved to 115 of revenue in 2014 as compared to 117 in 2013 

employee benefit costs increased 401 million primarily due to the increase in the number of fulltime employees eligible for benefits which led to higher payrollrelated taxes and paid time off benefits our employee benefit costs also increased for certain retirement benefit plans directly linked to the improvement in our net income and the share price of our common stock the cost for our health and dental benefit plans increased over 2013 primarily due to an increase in the total number of eligible employees in the plans this increase was partially offset by a reduction in the average cost per employee for these benefits in 2014 as compared to 2013 as a result health and dental benefit expenses decreased as a percent of salaries and wages which contributed to the overall improvement in total employee benefit costs as a percent of salaries and wages to 328 for 2014 from 346 for 2013 

operating supplies and expenses increased 475 million in 2014 as compared to 2013 although these costs as a percent of revenue improved to 155 of revenue in 2014 from 165 in 2013 the cost of diesel fuel excluding fuel taxes represents the largest component of operating supplies and expenses and can vary based on both consumption and average price per gallon our total miles driven in 2014 increased 164 as compared to 2013 which compared favorably to our diesel fuel consumption which increased only 130 during the same period our consumption trends continued to improve due to certain operational initiatives to increase our average miles per gallon and the increased use of new fuelefficient equipment our cost of diesel fuel excluding fuel taxes also benefited from a decrease in our average cost per gallon of 43 for 2014 from 2013 we do not use diesel fuel hedging instruments and are therefore subject to market price fluctuations other operating supplies and expenses excluding diesel fuel remained relatively consistent as a percent of revenue between the periods compared 

depreciation and amortization expense increased 194 million primarily due to the increase in depreciable assets acquired through our 2014 and 2013 capital expenditure plans as a percent of revenue our depreciation and amortization expense decreased to 53 in 2014 as compared to 54 in 2013 

purchased transportation expense increased 229 million or 215 in 2014 as compared to 2013 these costs however were relatively consistent as a percent of revenue between the periods compared we primarily utilized purchased transportation services from thirdparty providers in 2014 to support our container drayage truckload brokerage and international freightforwarding services to a lesser extent we also utilized purchased transportation in our ltl operations to maximize the efficient movement of freight 

miscellaneous expenses net increased 156 million in 2014 due to changes in our gains and losses recognized on the sale of operating assets increased consulting costs associated with our ongoing technology enhancement efforts and increased legal costs net gains on the sales of operating assets in 2014 were 07 million as compared to net gains of 57 million in 2013 

our effective tax rate for 2014 was 381 as compared to 373 in 2013 our effective tax rates in 2014 and 2013 were favorably impacted by various tax credits including credits for the use of alternative fuel in operations our effective tax rate generally exceeded the federal statutory rate of 35 due to the impact of state taxes and to a lesser extent certain other nondeductible items 

liquidity and capital resources 

a summary of our cash flows is presented below 



the change in our cash flows provided by operating activities in 2015 from 2014 was due primarily to fluctuations within our working capital accounts which include changes in income taxes customer receivables and certain accrued liabilities in addition an increase in our net income and higher depreciation and amortization expenses in 2015 as compared to 2014 as described above in “ results of operations ” also resulted in increased cash flows provided by operating activities 

the change in our cash flows provided by operating activities in 2014 from 2013 was due primarily to the significant improvement in our net income and higher depreciation and amortization expenses in 2014 as compared to 2013 which is more fully described above in “ results of operations ”   other changes in our cash flows provided by operating activities are related to various fluctuations within our working capital accounts 

the changes in our cash flows used in investing activities were primarily due to increases in our capital expenditure plan each year the changes in our capital expenditure plan are more fully described below in “ capital expenditures”   

the changes in our cash flows used in financing activities were primarily due to repurchases of our common stock which is more fully described below in stock repurchase program in addition scheduled principal payments under our longterm debt agreements and fluctuations in our senior unsecured revolving line of credit also impacted our cash flows used in financing activities in each of the years compared 

we have three primary sources of available liquidity cash and cash equivalents cash flows from operations and available borrowings under our senior unsecured revolving credit agreement which is described below we believe we also have sufficient access to debt and equity markets to provide other sources of liquidity 

capital expenditures 

the table below sets forth our net capital expenditures for property and equipment including those obtained through capital leases and nonmonetary exchanges for the years ended december 31 2015  2014  and 2013  



our capital expenditure requirements are generally based upon the projected increase in the number and size of our service center facilities to support our plan for longterm growth our planned tractor and trailer replacement cycle and forecasted tonnage and shipment growth expenditures for land and structures can be dependent upon the availability of land in the areas we are looking to expand our capital expenditures for tractors and trailers were higher in each of 2015 and 2014 as compared to the previous year due to the volume of equipment scheduled for replacement in those years as well as the 

equipment needs for anticipated growth we expect to continue to maintain a high level of capital expenditures in order to support our longterm plan for market share growth 

we currently estimate capital expenditures will be approximately 440 million for the year ending december 31 2016 approximately 180 million is allocated for the purchase of service center facilities construction of new service center facilities or expansion of existing service center facilities subject to the availability of suitable real estate and the timing of construction projects approximately 220 million is allocated for the purchase of tractors and trailers and approximately 40 million is allocated for investments in technology and other assets we expect to fund these capital expenditures primarily through cash flows from operations our existing cash and cash equivalents and the use of our senior unsecured revolving credit facility we believe our current sources of liquidity will be sufficient to satisfy our expected capital expenditures 

stock repurchase program 

on november 10 2014 we announced that our board of directors had approved a stock repurchase program authorizing us to repurchase up to an aggregate of 2000 million of our outstanding common stock we may repurchase shares from timetotime in open market purchases or through privately negotiated transactions the program expires on november 6 2016 shares of our common stock repurchased by us under the repurchase program are canceled at the time of repurchase and are authorized but unissued shares of our common stock during the twelve months ended december 31 2015 we repurchased 1682419 shares for 1141 million during the twelve months ended december 31 2014 we repurchased 70620 shares for 55 million as of december 31 2015 we had repurchased a total of 1753039 shares for 1196 million and 804 million remained authorized under the program 

financing agreements 

on december 15 2015 we entered into an amended and restated credit agreement with wells fargo bank national association wells fargo serving as administrative agent for the lenders the 2015 credit agreement the 2015 credit agreement provides for a fiveyear 2500 million  senior unsecured revolving line of credit we may also request an increase in the line of credit commitments up to an aggregate of 3500 million  which may include term loan commitments in minimum increments of 250 million  of the 2500 million  line of credit commitments up to 1000 million  may be used for letters of credit and 300 million  may be used for borrowings under the wells fargo sweep plus loan program the sweep program we utilize the sweep program to manage our daily cash needs as it automatically initiates borrowings to cover overnight cash requirements primarily for working capital needs 

the amounts outstanding and remaining borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facilities are presented below 



at our option borrowings under the 2015 credit agreement bear interest at either i libor plus an applicable margin based on our ratio of debttototal capitalization that ranges from 10  to 150  or ii a base rate plus an applicable margin based on our ratio of debttototal capitalization that ranges from 00  to 05  loans under the sweep program bear interest at the libor plus applicable margin rate letter of credit fees equal to the applicable margin for libor and base rate loans are charged quarterly in arrears on the daily average aggregate stated amount of all letters of credit outstanding during the quarter commitment fees ranging from 0125  to 02  based upon the ratio of debttototal capitalization are charged quarterly in arrears on the aggregate unutilized portion of the 2015 credit agreement wells fargo as administrative agent also receives an annual fee for providing administrative services 

for the periods covered under the 2015 credit agreement the applicable margin and letter of credit fees were 10  and commitment fees were 0125  

the 2015 credit agreement superseded and replaced our previous fiveyear 2000 million  senior unsecured revolving credit facility dated august 10 2011 as amended on november 7 2014 the 2011 credit agreement for periods in 2015 and 2014 under the 2011 credit agreement the applicable margin and letter of credit fees were 10  and commitment fees were 0175  

the 2015 credit agreement contains customary covenants including financial covenants that require us to observe a maximum ratio of debt to total capital and a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio any future whollyowned material domestic subsidiaries of old dominion would be required to guarantee payment of all of our obligations under the 2015 credit agreement 

the 2015 credit agreement also includes a provision limiting our ability to make restricted payments including dividends and payments for share repurchases unless among other conditions no defaults or events of default under the 2015 credit agreement are ongoing or would be caused by such restricted payment we did not declare or pay a cash dividend on our common stock in 2015 or 2014 and we have no plans to declare or pay a cash dividend in 2016 our share repurchases are described above in “ stock repurchase program ” 

we had two outstanding unsecured senior note agreements with an aggregate amount outstanding of 1200 million  at december 31 2015  at december 31 2014  we had three outstanding unsecured senior note agreements with an aggregate amount outstanding of 1557 million  these notes include scheduled principal payments with maturities that range from 2016 to 2021 of which 250 million  is due in the next twelve months interest rates on these notes are fixed and range from 400 to 585 the effective average interest rate on our outstanding senior note agreements was 468  and 487  at december 31 2015  and 2014  respectively 

with the exception of borrowings pursuant to the 2015 credit agreement interest rates are fixed on all of our debt instruments therefore shortterm exposure to fluctuations in interest rates is limited to our revolving credit facility we do not currently use interest rate derivative instruments to manage exposure to interest rate changes 

a significant decrease in demand for our services could limit our ability to generate cash flow and affect profitability most of our debt agreements have covenants that require stated levels of financial performance which if not achieved could cause acceleration of the payment schedules as of december 31 2015  we were in compliance with these covenants we do not anticipate a significant decline in business levels or financial performance that would cause us to violate any such covenants in the future and we believe the combination of our 2015 credit agreement along with our additional borrowing capacity will be sufficient to meet foreseeable seasonal and longterm capital needs 

contractual obligations 

the following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations as of december 31 2015  



  

 

critical accounting policies 

in preparing our financial statements we apply the following critical accounting policies that we believe affect our judgments and estimates of amounts recorded in certain assets liabilities revenue and expenses these critical accounting policies are further described in note 1 of the notes to the financial statements included in item 8 of this report 

revenue recognition 

we recognize revenue based upon when our transportation services have been completed in accordance with the bill of lading contract our general tariff provisions or contractual agreements with our customers generally this occurs when we complete the delivery of a shipment for transportation services not completed at the end of a reporting period we use a percentage of completion method to allocate the appropriate revenue to each separate reporting period under this method we develop a factor for each uncompleted shipment by dividing the actual number of days in transit at the end of a reporting period by that shipment’s standard delivery time schedule this factor is applied to the total revenue for that shipment and revenue is allocated between reporting periods accordingly 

allowances for uncollectible accounts and revenue adjustments 

we maintain an allowance for uncollectible accounts for estimated losses resulting from the failure of our customers to make required payments we estimate this allowance by analyzing the aging of our customer receivables our historical loss experience and other trends and factors affecting the credit risk of our customers we determine customer receivables to be past due when payment has not been received by the invoice due date writeoffs occur when we determine an account to be uncollectible and could differ from our allowance estimate as a result of factors such as changes in the overall economic environment or risks surrounding our customers additional allowances may be required if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments we periodically review the underlying assumptions in our estimate of the allowance for uncollectible accounts to ensure that the allowance reflects the most recent trends and factors 

we also maintain an allowance for estimated revenue adjustments resulting from future billing corrections customer allowances moneyback service guarantees and other miscellaneous revenue adjustments these revenue adjustments are recorded in our revenue from operations we use historical experience trends and current information to update and evaluate these estimates 

claims and insurance accruals 

claims and insurance accruals reflect the estimated cost of claims not covered by insurance for cargo loss and damage bipd workers’ compensation group health and dental the related costs are charged to insurance and claims expense except for workers’ compensation group health and dental which are charged to employee benefits expense 

insurers providing excess coverage above a companys selfinsured retention sir or deductible levels typically adjust their premiums to cover insured losses and for other market factors as a result we periodically evaluate our sir and deductible levels to determine the most costefficient balance between our exposure and excess coverage 

in establishing accruals for claims and expenses we evaluate and monitor each claim individually and we use factors such as historical claims development experience known trends and thirdparty estimates to determine the appropriate reserves for potential liability we believe the assumptions and methods used to estimate these liabilities are reasonable however any changes in the severity of previouslyreported claims significant changes in medical costs and regulatory changes affecting the administration of our plans could significantly impact the determination of appropriate reserves in future periods 

property and equipment 

property and equipment are recorded at cost and depreciated on a straightline basis over their estimated economic lives we use historical experience certain assumptions and estimates in determining the economic life of each asset when indicators of impairment exist we review property and equipment for impairment due to changes in operational and market conditions and we adjust the carrying value and economic life of any impaired asset as appropriate 

estimated economic lives for structures are 7 to 30 years revenue equipment is 4 to 15 years other equipment is 2 to 20 years and leasehold improvements are the lesser of the economic life of the leasehold improvement or the remaining life of the lease the use of different assumptions estimates or significant changes in the resale market for our equipment could result in material changes in the carrying value and related depreciation of our assets 

inflation 

most of our expenses are affected by inflation which typically results in increased operating costs in response to fluctuations in the cost of petroleum products particularly diesel fuel we generally include a fuel surcharge in our tariffs and contractual agreements the fuel surcharge is designed to offset the cost of diesel fuel above a base price and fluctuates as diesel fuel prices change from the base which is generally indexed to the doe’s published fuel prices that reset each week volatility in the price of diesel fuel independent of inflation has impacted our business as described in this report however we do not believe inflation has had a material effect on our results of operations for each of the past three years

audit committee approval

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact our financial position results of operations and cash flows due to adverse changes in financial market prices and rates 

we are exposed to interest rate risk directly related to loans if any under our 2015 credit agreement which have variable interest rates a 100 basis point increase in the average interest rate on this agreement would have no material effect on our operating results we have established policies and procedures to manage exposure to market risks and use major institutions that we believe are creditworthy to minimize credit risk 

we are exposed to market risk for equity investments relating to companyowned life insurance contracts on certain employees at december 31 2015  the cash value for variable life insurance contracts was 356 million of the 378 million of aggregate cash values for all life insurance contracts included on our balance sheets variable life insurance contracts expose us to fluctuations in equity markets however we utilize a thirdparty to manage these assets and minimize that exposure a 10 change in market value in those investments would have a 36 million impact on our pretax income 

we are exposed to market risk for awards granted under our employee and director phantom stock plans the liability for the unsettled outstanding awards is remeasured at the end of each reporting period based on the closing price of our common stock at that date at december 31 2015  the total liability for unsettled awards granted under our employee and director 

phantom stock plans totaled 253 million  a 10 change in the price of our common stock at december 31 2015  would have had a 25 million impact on our operating income in 2015  with respect to these plans 

we are also exposed to commodity price risk related to diesel fuel prices and manage our exposure to that risk primarily through the application of fuel surcharges to our customers 

for further discussion related to these risks see notes 2 and 7 of the notes to the financial statements included in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” and item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations”

overview 

we are a leading lessthantruckload “ltl” unionfree motor carrier providing regional interregional and national ltl services which include ground and air expedited transportation and consumer household pickup and delivery through a single integrated organization we were the fifth largest ltl motor carrier in the united states as measured by 2013 revenue according to transport topics  in addition to our core ltl services we offer a broad range of valueadded services including international freight forwarding container drayage truckload brokerage supply chain consulting and warehousing our services are complemented by our technological capabilities which we believe provide the tools to improve the efficiency of our operations while empowering our customers to manage their individual shipping needs more than 95 of our revenue is derived from transporting ltl shipments for our customers whose demand for our services is generally tied to industrial production and the overall health of the us domestic economy 

we have increased our revenue and customer base over the past five years primarily through organic growth our infrastructure allows us to provide nextday and secondday service within each of our six regions covering the continental united states as well as interregional and national service between these regions to support our ongoing expansion we added 12 new service centers during the past five years for a total of 222  at december 31 2014  

we believe our growth can be attributed to our focus on meeting our customers’ complete supply chain needs from a single point of contact while providing a superior level of customer service at a fair and equitable price our integrated structure allows us to offer our customers consistent highquality service from origin to destination and we believe our operating structure and proprietary information systems also enable us to efficiently manage our operating costs 

we were founded in 1934 and incorporated in virginia in 1950 our principal executive offices are located at 500 old dominion way thomasville north carolina 27360 please refer to the balance sheets and statements of operations included in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” in this report for information regarding our total assets revenue from operations and net income 

our industry 

trucking companies provide transportation services to virtually every industry operating in the united states and generally offer higher levels of reliability and faster transit times than other surface transportation options the trucking industry is comprised principally of two types of motor carriers ltl and truckload ltl carriers typically pick up multiple shipments from multiple customers on a single truck and then route that freight for delivery through service centers where the freight may be transferred to other trucks with similar destinations in contrast truckload carriers generally dedicate an entire truck to one customer from origin to destination 

according to the american trucking associations total us freight transportation revenue in 2013 was 8400 billion of which the trucking industry accounted for 812 the ltl sector had revenue in 2013 of 544 billion which represented 65 of total us freight transportation revenue in contrast to truckload carriers ltl motor carriers require expansive networks of local pickup and delivery “pd” service centers as well as larger breakbulk or hub facilities significant capital is required to create and maintain a network of service centers and a fleet of tractors and trailers the high fixed costs and capital spending requirements for ltl motor carriers make it difficult for new startup or small operators to effectively compete with established carriers in addition successful ltl motor carriers generally employ and regularly update a high level of technologybased systems and processes that provide information to customers and help reduce operating costs 

the ltl industry is highly competitive on the basis of service and price and has consolidated significantly since the industry was deregulated in 1980 based on 2013 revenue as reported in transport topics  the largest 10 and 25 ltl motor carriers accounted for approximately 473 and 578 respectively of the total ltl market we believe consolidation in our industry will continue due to customer demand for transportation providers offering both national and regional ltl as well as other complementary valueadded services

we compete with regional interregional and national ltl carriers and to a lesser extent with truckload carriers small package carriers airfreight carriers and railroads we also compete with and provide transportation services to thirdparty logistics providers that determine both the mode of transportation and the carrier we compete with several large and diversified transportation service providers each of which may have a broader global network and a wider range of services than we do competition is based primarily on service price and business relationships we believe we are able to compete effectively in our markets by providing highquality and timely service at a fair and equitable price 

throughout our organization we continuously seek to improve customer service by maximizing ontime performance and minimizing cargo claims we believe our transit times are generally faster than those of our principal national competitors in part because of our more efficient service center network use of team drivers and proprietary technology in addition we provide greater geographic coverage than most of our regional competitors our diversified mix and scope of regional interregional and national ltl service combined with our valueadded service offerings enables us to provide our customers with a single source to meet their shipping and logistics needs we believe this provides us with a distinct advantage over most of our regional multiregional and national competition 

we utilize flexible scheduling and train our employees to perform multiple tasks which we believe allows us to achieve greater productivity and higher levels of customer service than our competitors we believe our focus on employee communication continued education development and motivation strengthens the relationships and trust among our employees 

service center operations 

at december 31 2014  we operated through 222  service center locations of which we owned 176  and leased 46  we operate a total of ten major breakbulk facilities located in rialto california atlanta georgia chicago illinois indianapolis indiana greensboro north carolina harrisburg pennsylvania memphis and morristown tennessee dallas texas and salt lake city utah while using various other service centers for additional limited breakbulk activity in order to serve our nextday markets our service centers are strategically located in six regions of the country so that we can provide the highest quality service and minimize freight rehandling costs 

our service centers are responsible for the pickup and delivery of freight within their local service area each night our service centers load outbound freight for transport to other service centers for delivery all inbound freight received by the service center in the evening or during the night is generally scheduled for local delivery the next business day unless a 

customer requests a different delivery schedule our management reviews the productivity and service performance of each service center on a daily basis to help ensure quality service and efficient operations 

while we have established primary responsibility for customer service at the local service center level our customers may access information and initiate transactions through our centralized customer service department located at our corporate office or through several other gateways such as our website mobile applications electronic data interchange “edi” email and fax notification systems and automated voice response systems our systems offer direct access to information such as freight tracking shipping documents rate quotes rate databases and account activity these centralized systems and our customer service department provide our customers with a single point of contact to access information across all areas of our operations and for each of our service offerings 

linehaul transportation 

linehaul dispatchers control the movement of freight between service centers through integrated freight movement systems we also utilize loadplanning software to optimize efficiencies in our linehaul operations our management team monitors freight movements transit times load factors and many other productivity measurements to help ensure that we maintain our high levels of service and efficiency 

we utilize scheduled routes and additional linehaul dispatches as necessary to meet our published transit times in addition we lower our cost structure by primarily using twin 28foot trailers in our linehaul operations the use of twin 28foot trailers permits us to transport freight directly from its point of origin to destination with minimal unloading and reloading which also reduces cargo loss and damage expenses we utilize longcombination vehicles such as triple 28foot trailers and combinations of 48foot and 28foot trailers in states where permitted twin trailers and longcombination vehicles permit more freight to be transported behind a tractor than could otherwise be transported by one trailer 

tractors trailers and maintenance 

at december 31 2014  we owned 6907  tractors we generally use new tractors in linehaul operations for approximately three to five years and then transfer those tractors to pd operations for the remainder of their useful lives in many of our service centers tractors perform pd functions during the day and linehaul functions at night to maximize tractor utilization 

at december 31 2014  we owned 27259  trailers we primarily purchase new trailers for our operations however we occasionally purchase preowned equipment that meets our specifications the purchase of preowned equipment can provide an excellent value but also can increase our fleet’s average age the table below reflects as of december 31 2014  the average age of our tractors and trailers 



we develop certain specifications for tractors and trailers and then negotiate the production and purchase of this equipment with several manufacturers these purchases are planned well in advance of anticipated delivery dates in order to accommodate manufacturers’ production schedules we believe there is sufficient capacity among suppliers to ensure an uninterrupted supply of equipment to support our operations 

the table below sets forth our capital expenditures for tractors and trailers for the years ended december 31 2014  2013  and 2012  for more information concerning our capital expenditures see item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations – liquidity and capital resources ” in this report 



at december 31 2014  we operated 38 maintenance centers at certain service center locations throughout our network these maintenance centers are equipped to perform routine and preventive maintenance and repairs on our equipment 

we adhere to established maintenance policies and procedures to help ensure our fleet is properly maintained tractors are routed to appropriate maintenance facilities at designated mileage intervals or every 90 days whichever occurs first trailers are scheduled for maintenance every 90 days 

customers 

revenue is generated primarily from customers throughout the united states and north america in 2014  our largest customer accounted for approximately 26 of our revenue and our largest 5 10 and 20 customers accounted for approximately 97 148 and 215 of our revenue respectively for each of the previous three years more than 95 of our revenue was derived from transporting ltl shipments for our customers and less than 5 of our revenue was generated from international services we believe the diversity of our customer base helps protect our business from adverse developments in a single geographic region and from the reduction or loss of business from a single customer 

we utilize an integrated freightcosting system to determine the price level at which a particular shipment of freight will be profitable we can modify elements of this freightcosting model to simulate the actual conditions under which the freight will be moved many of our customers engage our services through the terms and provisions of our tariffs and through negotiated service contracts we also compete for business by participating in bid solicitations customers generally solicit bids for relatively large numbers of shipments for a period of one to two years and typically choose to enter into contractual arrangements with a limited number of motor carriers based upon price and service 

seasonality 

our operations are subject to seasonal trends common in the trucking industry our operating margins in the first quarter are normally lower due to reduced demand during the winter months harsh weather can also adversely affect our performance by reducing demand and reducing our ability to transport freight which could result in decreased revenue and increased operating expenses 

technology 

we continually seek to upgrade and enhance our technological capabilities and we provide access to our systems through multiple gateways that offer our customers and employees maximum flexibility and immediate access to information we employ vehicle safety systems onboard and handheld computer systems freight handling systems and logistics technology to reduce costs and transit times our data systems are integrated in every level within our organization which we believe is critical to our success and performance our systems are protected through physical and software safeguards as well as redundant systems network security measures and backup systems considered appropriate by management we continue to focus on the development and enhancement of the technology used in our operations in order to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of our services 

insurance 

we carry a significant amount of insurance with thirdparty insurance carriers but we are exposed to the risk of loss on claims up to the limit for which we hold either a selfinsured retention sir or deductible at december 31 2014  the amounts of our sir andor deductibles were as follows 275 million per occurrence for bodily injury and property damage “bipd” claims 100000 per claim for cargo loss and damage 10 million per occurrence for workers’ compensation claims and 400000 per occurrence with a 400000 aggregate over our retention level for group health claims 

we believe that our policy of maintaining an sir or deductible for a portion of our risks supported by our safety and loss prevention programs is an effective means of managing insurance costs we periodically review our risk exposure and insurance coverage applicable to those risks and we believe that we maintain sufficient insurance coverage 

diesel fuel availability and cost 

we depend heavily upon the availability of diesel fuel to provide our transportation services we maintain fuel storage and pumping facilities at certain service center locations as the primary source for fueling our fleet and we utilize overtheroad fueling options at retail locations as necessary we could be susceptible to regional andor national fuel shortages which could cause us to incur additional expense in order to obtain an adequate supply within our own fueling network or cause us to rely more heavily on higherpriced retail fuel 

we believe our operations and financial condition are susceptible to the same diesel fuel price increases or shortages as those of our competitors we implemented a fuel surcharge program in august 1999 which has remained in effect since that time and is one of many components that we use to determine the overall price for our transportation services our fuel surcharges are generally indexed to fuel prices published by the us department of energy the “doe” that reset each week 

employees 

as of december 31 2014  we employed 16443  individuals on a fulltime basis none of which were represented under a collective bargaining agreement our fulltime employees work in the following roles 



as of december 31 2014  we employed 4484 linehaul drivers and 4249 pd drivers on a fulltime basis we select our drivers primarily based upon safe driving records and experience among other requirements our drivers must pass a drug test have a current us department of transportation “dot” physical and have a valid commercial driver’s license prior to employment once employed drivers are required to obtain and maintain hazardous materials endorsements to their commercial driver’s licenses drivers like all of our employees are required to take preemployment drug and alcohol tests and are randomly selected for periodic additional testing 

since 1988 we have provided the opportunity for qualified employees to become drivers through the “old dominion driver training program” there are currently 2290 active drivers who have successfully completed this training which was approximately 26 of our driver workforce as of december 31 2014  we believe our driver training and qualification programs have been important factors in improving our safety record and retaining qualified drivers we reward our drivers who maintain safe driving records with bonuses of up to 3000 per driver payable each year our driver safety bonuses totaled 31 million 28 million and 26 million in 2014  2013  and 2012  respectively in addition we have experienced an annual turnover rate for our driver graduates of approximately 58 which is below our companywide turnover rate for all drivers of approximately 109 

governmental regulation 

we are subject to regulation by many federal governmental agencies including the federal motor carrier safety administration the “fmcsa” the pipeline and hazardous materials safety administration and the surface transportation board which are agencies within the dot we are also subject to rules and regulations of various state agencies these regulatory authorities have broad powers generally governing matters such as authority to engage in motor carrier operations motor carrier registration driver hours of service safety and fitness of transportation equipment and drivers certain mergers consolidations and acquisitions and periodic financial reporting in addition we are subject to compliance with cargosecurity and transportation regulations issued by the transportation security administration tsa within the us department of homeland security 

in october 2009 the us court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit ordered the fmcsa to review and reissue rules governing hours of service for commercial truck drivers by july 26 2011 this deadline was extended and on december 22 2011 the fmcsa issued its final rule which mandated compliance by july 1 2013 the 2011 rule reduced the maximum number of hours a truck driver could work each week to 70 hours from the former 82hour limit the 2011 rule maintained the maximum 11hour daily driving limit but required drivers to take a 30minute break prior to working beyond 

eight hours the 2011 rule also modified the “34hour restart” provision to include two periods of rest between 1 am and 5 am and limited a restart to once every 168 hours on december 16 2014 however the 2015 omnibus appropriations bill temporarily suspended enforcement of certain aspects of the restart provisions until september 30 2015 specifically the new law temporarily eliminated the requirements for two rest periods between 1 am and 5 am and the 168hour minimum restart provision during this suspension period the law directs the secretary of the dot to conduct a study of the operational safety health and fatigue aspects of the restart provisions in effect before and after july 1 2013 

implementation of the 2011 rule on july 1 2013 required us to make certain changes in our operating procedures these changes increased our operating costs by limiting the productivity of our drivers while the suspension of certain aspects of the restart provisions should allow us to regain some of this lost productivity the suspension is temporary and we do not plan to make significant changes to our operations as a result we could continue to incur higher operating costs than we had before the 2011 rule went into effect 

we are subject to future rulemaking by the fmcsa and other regulatory agencies which could be more stringent require additional changes to our operations increase our operating costs or otherwise adversely impact our results of operations 

the trucking industry is subject to regulatory and legislative changes from a variety of other governmental authorities which address matters such as i increasingly stringent environmental and occupational safety and health regulations ii limits on vehicle weight and size iii ergonomics and iv port security these changes may affect our business or the economics of our industry by requiring changes in operating practices or by influencing the demand for and increasing the costs of providing our services 

environmental regulation 

we are subject to various federal state and local environmental laws and regulations that focus on among other things the emission and discharge of hazardous materials into the environment or their presence at our properties or in our vehicles fuel storage tanks transportation of certain materials and the discharge or retention of storm water under specific environmental laws we could also be held responsible for any costs relating to contamination at our past or present facilities and at thirdparty waste disposal sites as well as costs associated with cleanup of accidents involving our vehicles we do not believe that the cost of future compliance with current environmental laws or regulations will have a material adverse effect on our operations financial condition competitive position or capital expenditures for the remainder of 2015  or fiscal year 2016 however future changes to laws or regulations may adversely affect our operations and could result in unforeseen costs to our business

 item 1a risk factors 

various factors exist that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those projected in any forwardlooking statement in addition to the factors discussed elsewhere in this report we believe the following are some of the important risks and uncertainties that could materially affect our business financial condition or results of operations 

we operate in a highly competitive industry and our business will suffer if we are unable to adequately address potential downward pricing pressures and other factors that may adversely affect our operations and profitability 

numerous competitive factors could impair our ability to maintain our current profitability these factors include but are not limited to the following 

 6 

 

if we are unable to effectively compete with other ltl carriers whether on the basis of price service or otherwise we may be unable to retain existing customers or attract new customers either of which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

if our employees were to unionize our operating costs would increase and our ability to compete would be impaired 

none of our employees are currently represented under a collective bargaining agreement however from time to time there have been efforts to organize our employees at various service centers further congress or one or more states could approve legislation andor the national labor relations board could render decisions or implement rule changes that could significantly affect our business and our relationship with our employees including actions that could substantially liberalize the procedures for union organization in addition we can offer no assurance that the department of labor will not adopt new regulations or interpret existing regulations in a manner that would favor the agenda of unions or that our employees will not unionize in the future particularly if regulatory changes occur that facilitate unionization 

the unionization of our employees could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations because 

 

if we are unable to successfully execute our growth strategy our business and future results of operations may suffer 

our growth strategy includes increasing the volume of freight moving through our existing service center network selectively expanding our geographic footprint and broadening the scope of our service offerings in connection with our growth strategy at various times we have made selective acquisitions purchased additional equipment expanded and upgraded service centers and increased our sales and marketing efforts and we expect to continue to do so our growth strategy exposes us to a number of risks including the following 

 

we cannot assure that we will overcome the risks associated with our growth strategy if we fail to overcome those risks we may not realize additional revenue or profits from our efforts we may incur additional expenses and therefore our financial position and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 

we may be unable to successfully consummate and integrate acquisitions as part of our growth strategy 

growth through acquisitions has been a key component of our ltl growth strategy throughout our history in the future we may seek to acquire other ltl carriers as well as other complementary businesses exploration of potential acquisitions requires significant attention from our senior management team in addition we expect to compete for acquisition opportunities with other companies some of which may have greater financial and other resources than we do we cannot assure that we will 

have sufficient cash with which to consummate an acquisition or otherwise be able to obtain financing for any acquisition if we are unable to access sufficient funding for potential acquisitions we may not be able to complete transactions that we otherwise find advantageous 

any subsequent acquisition will entail numerous risks including 

 

in addition we may have difficulty integrating any acquired business and its operations services and personnel into our existing operations and such integration may require a significant amount of time and effort by our management team to the extent we do not successfully avoid or overcome the risks or problems resulting from any acquisitions we undertake there could be a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our customers’ and suppliers’ businesses may be impacted by a downturn in the economy andor a disruption of financial markets which may decrease demand for our services 

adverse economic conditions can negatively affect our customers’ business levels the amount of transportation services they need their ability to pay for our services and overall freight levels all of which might impair our asset utilization customers encountering adverse economic conditions may be unable to obtain additional financing or financing under acceptable terms due to disruptions in the capital and credit markets these customers represent a greater potential for bad debt losses which may require us to increase our reserve for bad debt economic conditions resulting in bankruptcies of one or more of our large customers could have a significant impact on our financial position results of operations or liquidity in a particular year or quarter further when adverse economic times arise customers may bid out freight or select competitors that offer lower rates in an attempt to lower their costs and we might be forced to lower our rates or lose freight 

our suppliers’ business levels also may be negatively affected by adverse economic conditions or financial constraints which could lead to disruptions in the supply and availability of equipment parts and services critical to our operations a significant interruption in our normal supply chain could disrupt our operations increase our costs and negatively impact our ability to serve our customers 

we also are subject to cost increases outside of our control that could materially reduce our profitability if we are unable to increase our rates sufficiently such cost increases include but are not limited to increases in fuel prices driver wages interest rates taxes tolls license and registration fees insurance revenue equipment and healthcare for our employees 

difficulties attracting and retaining qualified drivers could result in increases in driver compensation and could adversely affect our profitability and our ability to maintain or grow our fleet 

from time to time we have experienced difficulty in attracting and retaining sufficient numbers of qualified drivers and such shortages may recur in the future due in part to the time commitment the physical strains of the work and the current industry conditions the available pool of employee drivers has been declining regulatory requirements including the compliance safety accountability initiative the csa of the fmcsa have also reduced the number of eligible drivers and may continue to do so in the future because of the intense competition for drivers we may face difficulty maintaining or increasing our number of drivers the compensation we offer our drivers is subject to market conditions that may require increases in driver compensation which becomes more likely as economic conditions improve if we are unable to attract and retain a sufficient number of drivers we could be required to adjust our compensation packages or operate with fewer trucks and face difficulty meeting customer demands any of which could adversely affect our growth and profitability 

insurance and claims expenses could significantly reduce our profitability 

we are exposed to claims related to cargo loss and damage property damage personal injury workers’ compensation group health and group dental we have insurance coverage with thirdparty insurance carriers but we assume a significant portion of the risk associated with these claims due to our sirs and deductibles our operating results would be adversely affected if any of the following were to occur i the number or severity of claims increases ii we are required to accrue or pay additional amounts because the claims prove to be more severe than our original assessment or iii claims exceed our excess coverage amounts if claims exceed our sir or deductible levels or insurance market conditions change insurers could raise premiums for excess coverage to cover their expenses and anticipated future losses in addition insurance companies require us to obtain letters of credit to collateralize our sir or deductible levels if these requirements increase our borrowing capacity could be adversely affected 

healthcare legislation may increase our costs and reduce our future profitability 

to attract and retain employees we maintain a competitive health insurance plan for our employees and their dependents we cannot predict the impact that any state or federal healthcare legislation or regulation including the patient protection and affordable care act will have on our operations but we expect costs associated with providing benefits under employee medical plans to continue to increase rising healthcare costs in the united states could result in significant longterm costs to us which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results in addition rising healthcare costs could force us to make further changes to our benefits program which could negatively impact our ability to attract and retain employees 

we have significant ongoing cash requirements that could limit our growth and affect our profitability if we are unable to obtain sufficient capital 

our business is highly capital intensive we generally finance our capital expenditures and planned growth with existing cash cash flow from operations issuance of debt and through available borrowings under our existing senior unsecured credit agreement we may require additional capital to finance longterm real estate purchase opportunities and acquisitions which we may fund through additional debt or through equity offerings if we are unable in the future to generate sufficient cash from our operations or raise capital by accessing the debt and equity markets we may be forced to limit our growth and operate our equipment for longer periods of time which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results 

our business also has significant ongoing operating cash requirements if our cash requirements are high or our cash flow from operations is low during particular periods we may need to seek additional financing which could be costly or difficult to obtain 

limited supply and increased prices for new equipment may adversely affect our earnings and cash flow 

we may face difficulty in purchasing new equipment due to decreased supply and increased costs investment in new equipment is a significant part of our annual capital expenditures and we require an available supply of tractors and trailers from equipment manufacturers to operate and grow our business we are also subject to shortages in raw materials that are required for the production of critical operating equipment and supplies such as shortages in rubber or steel 

the price of our equipment may also be adversely affected in the future by regulations on newly manufactured tractors and diesel engines we have incurred significant increases in the cost of tractors due to regulations issued by the us environmental protection agency the “epa” and various state agencies that require progressive reductions in exhaust emissions from diesel engines beginning in october 2002 new diesel engines were required to meet these new emission limits some of the regulations required reductions in the sulfur content of diesel fuel beginning in june 2006 and the introduction of emissions aftertreatment devices on newlymanufactured engines and vehicles beginning with modelyear 2007 the final phase of these regulations required reduced nitrogen and nonmethane hydrocarbon emissions beginning with modelyear 2010 beginning in 2013 these regulations also required that all heavyduty diesel engines built for highway applications over 14000 pounds include certified onboard diagnostics systems to monitor emissions these regulations have resulted in higher prices for tractors and diesel engines and increased operating and maintenance costs and there can be no assurance that continued increases in pricing or costs will not have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

we may be adversely impacted by fluctuations in the availability and price of diesel fuel 

diesel fuel is a critical component of our operations and a significant operating expense for our business diesel fuel prices and fuel availability can be impacted by factors beyond our control such as natural or manmade disasters adverse weather conditions political events disruption or failure of technology or information systems price and supply decisions by oil producing countries and cartels terrorist activities armed conflict and world supply and demand imbalances we maintain fuel storage and pumping facilities at many of our service center locations however we may be susceptible to fuel shortages at certain locations that could cause us to incur additional expense to ensure adequate supply on a timely basis to prevent a disruption to our service schedules an interruption in the supply of diesel fuel could have a material adverse effect on our operating results 

we do not hedge against the risk of diesel fuel price increases an increase in diesel fuel prices or diesel fuel taxes or any change in federal or state regulations that results in such an increase could have a material adverse effect on our operating results we have fuel surcharge programs in place with a majority of our customers which help offset the negative impact of the increased cost of diesel fuel and other petroleumbased products however we also incur fuel costs that cannot be recovered even with respect to customers with which we maintain fuel surcharge programs such as those costs associated with empty miles or the time when our engines are idling because our fuel surcharge recovery lags behind changes in fuel prices our fuel surcharge recovery may not capture the increased costs we pay for fuel especially when prices are rising leading to fluctuations in our levels of reimbursement we regularly monitor the components of our pricing including fuel surcharges and address individual account profitability issues with our customers when necessary however there can be no assurance that fuel surcharges can be maintained indefinitely or will be sufficiently effective in offsetting increases in diesel fuel prices 

we are subject to various environmental laws and regulations and costs of compliance with liabilities under or violations of existing or future environmental laws or regulations could adversely affect our business 

we are subject to various federal state and local environmental laws and regulations that govern among other things the emission and discharge of hazardous materials into the environment the presence of hazardous materials at our properties or in our vehicles fuel storage tanks the transportation of certain materials and the discharge or retention of storm water under certain environmental laws we could also be held responsible for any costs relating to contamination at our past or present facilities and at thirdparty waste disposal sites as well as costs associated with the cleanup of accidents involving our vehicles environmental laws have become and are expected to continue to be increasingly more stringent over time and there can be no assurance that our costs of complying with current or future environmental laws or liabilities arising under such laws will not have a material adverse effect on our business operations or financial condition 

in addition to the epa regulations on exhaust emissions with which we must comply there is an increased regulatory focus on climate change and greenhouse gas emissions in the united states we are also subject to increasing sensitivity to sustainability issues this increased focus on sustainability may result in new regulations andor customer requirements that could adversely impact our business any future limitations on the emission of greenhouse gases other environmental legislation or customer sustainability requirements could increase our future capital expenditures and have an adverse impact on our financial condition results of operations and liquidity 

we are subject to the risks of litigation and governmental proceedings which could adversely affect our business 

we are and in the future may be subject to legal and governmental proceedings and claims the parties in such legal actions may seek amounts from us that may not be covered in whole or in part by insurance defending ourselves against such legal actions could result in significant costs and could require a substantial amount of time and effort by our management team we cannot predict the outcome of litigation or governmental proceedings to which we are a party or whether we will be subject to future legal actions as a result the potential costs associated with legal actions against us could adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations 

we are subject to various risks arising from our international business operations and relationships which could adversely affect our business 

we arrange for transportation and logistics services to and from various international locations and are subject to both the risks of conducting international business and the requirements of the foreign corrupt practices act of 1977 the fcpa failure to comply with the fcpa may result in legal claims against us in addition we face other risks associated with international operations and relationships which may include restrictive trade policies imposition of duties taxes or government royalties imposed by foreign governments 

we operate in a highly regulated industry and increased costs of compliance with or liability for violation of existing or future regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business 

we are regulated by the dot and by various state agencies these regulatory authorities have broad powers generally governing matters such as authority to engage in motor carrier operations as well as motor carrier registration driver hours of service safety and fitness of transportation equipment and drivers transportation of hazardous materials certain mergers and acquisitions and periodic financial reporting in addition the trucking industry is subject to regulatory and legislative changes from a variety of other governmental authorities which address matters such as i increasingly stringent environmental occupational safety and health regulations ii limits on vehicle weight and size iii ergonomics iv port security and v hours of service in addition we are subject to compliance with cargosecurity and transportation regulations issued by the tsa within the us department of homeland security regulatory requirements and changes in regulatory requirements may affect our business or the economics of the industry by requiring changes in operating practices or by influencing the demand for and increasing the costs of providing transportation services 

in october 2009 the us court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit ordered the fmcsa to review and reissue rules governing hours of service for commercial truck drivers by july 26 2011 this deadline was extended and on december 22 2011 the fmcsa issued its final rule which mandated compliance by july 1 2013 the 2011 rule reduced the maximum number of hours a truck driver could work each week to 70 hours from the former 82hour limit the 2011 rule maintained the maximum 11hour daily driving limit but required drivers to take a 30minute break prior to working beyond

implementation of the 2011 rule on july 1 2013 required us to make certain changes in our operating procedures these changes increased our operating costs by limiting the productivity of our drivers while the suspension of certain aspects of the restart provisions should allow us to regain some of this lost productivity the suspension is temporary and we do not plan to make significant changes to our operations as a result we could continue to incur higher operating costs than we had before the 2011 rule went into effect 

we are subject to future rulemaking by the fmcsa and other regulatory agencies which could be more stringent require additional changes to our operations increase our operating costs or otherwise adversely impact our results of operations 

the fmcsa’s csa initiative could adversely impact our ability to hire qualified drivers meet our growth projections and maintain our customer relationships each of which could adversely impact our results of operations 

the csa includes compliance and enforcement initiatives designed to monitor and improve commercial motor vehicle safety by measuring the safety record of both the motor carrier and the driver these measurements are scored and used by the fmcsa to identify potential safety risks and to direct enforcement action certain measurements and scores collected by the csa from transportation companies are available to the general public on the fmcsa’s website 

our csa scores are dependent upon our safety and compliance experience which could change at any time in addition the safety standards prescribed in csa could change and our ability to maintain an acceptable score could be adversely impacted if we receive an unacceptable csa score our relationships with our customers could be damaged which could result in a loss of business 

the requirements of csa could shrink the industry’s pool of drivers as those with unfavorable scores could leave the industry as a result the costs to attract train and retain qualified drivers could increase in addition a shortage of qualified drivers could increase driver turnover decrease asset utilization limit growth and adversely impact our results of operations 

our results of operations may be affected by seasonal factors and harsh weather conditions 

our operations are subject to seasonal trends common in the trucking industry our operating margins in the first quarter are normally lower due to reduced demand during the winter months harsh weather can also adversely affect our performance by reducing demand and reducing our ability to transport freight which could result in decreased revenue and increased operating expenses 

if we are unable to retain our key employees our financial condition results of operations and liquidity could be adversely affected 

our success will continue to depend upon the experience and leadership of our key employees and executive officers in that regard the loss of the services of any of our key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and liquidity if we are unable to secure replacement personnel that have sufficient experience in our industry and in the management of our business if we are unable to continue to develop and retain a core group of management personnel and execute succession planning strategies our business could be negatively impacted in the future 

our principal shareholders control a large portion of our outstanding common stock 

earl e congdon david s congdon john r congdon jr and members of their respective families beneficially own an aggregate of approximately 25 of the outstanding shares of our common stock as long as the congdon family controls a large portion of our voting stock they may be able to significantly influence the election of the entire board of directors and the outcome of all matters involving a shareholder vote the congdon family’s interests may differ from the interests of other shareholders and the status of their ownership could change at their discretion 

our financial results may be adversely impacted by potential future changes in accounting practices 

future changes in accounting standards or practices and related legal and regulatory interpretations of those changes may adversely impact public companies in general the transportation industry or our operations specifically new accounting standards or requirements such as a conversion from us generally accepted accounting principles to international financial reporting standards could change the way we record revenues expenses assets andor liabilities or could be costly to implement these types of regulations could have a negative impact on our financial position liquidity results of operations andor access to capital 

our information technology systems are subject to cyber and other risks some of which are beyond our control which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial position 

we are reliant on the proper functioning and availability of our information systems for our operations as well as providing a valueadded service to our customers our information systems including our accounting systems and communications and data processing systems are integral to the efficient operation of our business it is critical that the data processed by these systems remain confidential as it often includes competitive customer information confidential customer transaction data employee records and key financial and operational results and statistics cyber incidents that impact the security availability reliability speed accuracy or other proper functioning of these systems and measures including outages computer viruses breakins and similar disruptions could have a significant impact on our operations although our information systems are protected through physical and software safeguards as well as redundant systems network security measures and backup systems considered appropriate by management it is not practicable to protect against the possibility of power loss telecommunications failures cybersecurity attacks and other cyber incidents in every potential circumstance that may arise a significant cyber incident including system failure security breach disruption by malware or other damage could interrupt or delay our operations damage our reputation cause a loss of customers expose us to a risk of loss or litigation andor cause us to incur significant time and expense to remedy such an event any of which could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial position 

we rely heavily on information technology systems and any disruption to our technology infrastructure or failures of essential services upon which our information technology platforms rely could cause us to incur costs or result in a loss of business which may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

our information technology systems are complex and require ongoing investments and enhancements to meet our internal and our customers’ requirements our information technology systems also depend upon the internet thirdparty service providers global communications providers satellitebased communications systems the electric utilities grid electric utility providers and telecommunications providers we have no control over the operation quality or maintenance of these services or whether vendors will improve their services or continue to provide services that are essential to our business disruptions due to transitional challenges in upgrading or enhancing our technology systems or failures in the services upon which our information technology platforms rely which may arise from adverse weather conditions or natural calamities such as floods hurricanes earthquakes or tornadoes illegal acts including terrorist attacks human error or systems modernization initiatives andor other disruptions may adversely affect the services we provide which could increase our costs or result in a loss of customers that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position 

misuse of social media outlets could damage our reputation and adversely affect our financial condition  

customers competitors employees and other individuals continue to increase the use of social media outlets and we maintain and manage our own corporate presence through various social media outlets we support new ways of sharing data and communicating through these social media outlets however information distributed via social networking could result in unfavorable publicity about us being disseminated quickly and broadly this unfavorable publicity could damage our reputation and may result in a reduction in demand for our services or the loss of customers that could have a negative impact on our financial condition results of operations and liquidity 

a decrease in the demand and value of used equipment may impact our results of operations 

as we purchase new tractors as part of our normal replacement cycle each year we rely on the used equipment market to dispose of our older equipment oversupply in the transportation industry as well as adverse domestic and foreign economic conditions can negatively impact the demand for used tractors and therefore reduce the value we can obtain on our used equipment if we are unable to sell our older equipment at or above our salvage value the resulting losses could have a significant impact on our results of operations 

if we raise additional capital in the future your ownership in us could be diluted 

any issuance of equity we may undertake in the future to raise additional capital could cause the price of our common stock to decline or require us to issue shares at a price that is lower than that paid by holders of our common stock in the past which would result in those newly issued shares being dilutive if we obtain funds through a credit facility or through the issuance of debt or preferred securities these obligations and securities would likely have rights senior to your rights as a common shareholder which could impair the value of our common stock 

the market value of our common stock may fluctuate and could be substantially affected by various factors 

the price of our common stock on the nasdaq global select market constantly changes we expect that the market price of our common stock will continue to fluctuate as a result of a variety of factors many of which are beyond our control these factors include among others 

 

our common stock price may fluctuate significantly in the future and these fluctuations may be unrelated to our performance general market price declines or market volatility in the future could adversely affect the price of our common stock and the current market price of our common stock may not be indicative of future market prices 

our articles of incorporation our bylaws and virginia law contain provisions that could discourage delay or prevent a change in our control or our management 

provisions of our articles of incorporation bylaws and the laws of virginia the state in which we are incorporated may discourage delay or prevent a change in control of us or a change in management that shareholders may consider favorable these provisions 

 

these provisions could discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for you and other shareholders to take certain corporate actions these provisions could also limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

overview 

we are a leading lessthantruckload “ltl” unionfree motor carrier providing regional interregional and national ltl services which include ground and air expedited transportation and consumer household pickup and delivery through a single integrated organization in addition to our core ltl services we offer a broad range of valueadded services including international freight forwarding container drayage truckload brokerage supply chain consulting and warehousing more than 95 of our revenue has historically been derived from transporting ltl shipments for our customers whose demand for our services is generally tied to industrial production and the overall health of the us domestic economy 

in analyzing the components of our revenue we monitor changes and trends in our ltl services using the following key metrics which exclude certain transportation and logistics services where pricing is generally not determined by weight commodity or distance 

 

revenue per hundredweight is a commonlyused indicator of pricing trends but this metric can be influenced by other factors such as changes in fuel surcharges weight per shipment length of haul and the class or mix of our freight as a result changes in revenue per hundredweight do not necessarily indicate actual changes in underlying base rates 

 

 

our primary revenue focus is to increase “density” which is shipment and tonnage growth within our existing infrastructure increases in density allow us to maximize our asset utilization and labor productivity which we measure over many different functional areas of our operations including linehaul load factor pickup and delivery “pd” stops per hour pd shipments per hour platform pounds handled per hour and platform shipments per hour in addition to our focus on density and operating efficiencies it is critical for us to obtain an appropriate yield on the shipments we handle we manage our yields by focusing on individual account profitability we believe yield management and improvements in efficiency are key components in our ability to produce profitable growth 

our primary cost elements are direct wages and benefits associated with the movement of freight fuel and other operating supplies and expenses and depreciation of our equipment fleet and service center facilities we gauge our overall success in managing costs by monitoring our operating ratio a measure of profitability calculated by dividing total operating expenses by revenue which also allows for industrywide comparisons with our competition 

results of operations 

the following table sets forth for the years indicated expenses and other items as a percentage of revenue from operations 



  

   

2014  compared to 2013   

key financial and operating metrics for 2014  and 2013  are presented below 



our 2014 financial results reflect strong increases in revenue net income and earnings per diluted share our revenue increased 193 to 279 billion and our operating ratio improved by 130 basis points to 842 which represents the fifth consecutive year that our operating ratio has improved by more than 100 basis points as a result our net income increased 298 from the prioryear period to 2675 million in 2014 

our revenue growth was driven by a 169 increase in ltl tons combined with a 21 increase in revenue per hundredweight our tonnage growth is primarily the result of market share gains from new and existing customers that desire the value of superior service at a fair and equitable price this growth increased density throughout our operations which contributed to our improved profitability for the year our growth has required continuous and significant investments in our service center network equipment technology and employees as a result our capital expenditures were 3677 million in 2014 and we expect our capital expenditures to be even higher in 2015 in addition we added 2370 fulltime employees in 2014 which included an increase in our total number of drivers of 1253 or 168 we believe these investments provided the additional capacity to meet existing demand and positions us well for anticipated future growth 

revenue 

our revenue increased 4502 million or 193 during 2014 which was a result of increases in both ltl tonnage and yield ltl tonnage increased 169 primarily due to the 142 increase in ltl shipments and a 23 increase in weight per shipment we believe that our tonnage growth in 2014 was primarily due to further market share gains from our existing customers the addition of new customers and the general improvement in the domestic economy 

ltl revenue per hundredweight increased 21 to 1833 in 2014 despite declines in fuel surcharge rates the decrease in length of haul and the increase in weight per shipment each of which generally has the effect of lowering this metric ltl revenue per hundredweight excluding fuel surcharges increased 28 in 2014 as compared to 2013 we believe the increase in revenue per hundredweight reflects our disciplined yield management process and a favorable pricing environment that has resulted from general capacity constraints in the ltl industry 

our fuel surcharges are designed to offset fluctuations in the cost of petroleumbased products and are one of the many components included in the overall negotiated price we charge for our services fuel surcharge revenue decreased to 155 of revenue in 2014 from 161 in 2013 primarily due to a decrease in the average price per gallon for diesel fuel for those comparative periods most of our tariffs and contracts provide for a fuel surcharge that is generally indexed to the u s department of energys doe published diesel fuel prices that reset each week fluctuations in fuel surcharges between the periods are primarily the result of changes in the underlying price of diesel fuel we regularly monitor the components of our pricing including base freight rates and fuel surcharges we also address any individual account profitability issues with our customers as part of our effort to minimize the negative impact on our profitability that would likely result from a rapid and significant change in any of our operating expenses 

operating costs and other expenses 

salaries wages and benefits increased 2105 million or 180 in 2014 due to a 1704 million increase in the costs for salaries and wages and a 401 million increase in benefit costs the increases in salaries and wages excluding benefits are primarily due to the 135 increase in the average number of fulltime employees over 2013 and the annual wage increases in 2013 and 2014 the increase in employees primarily relates to our productive labor workforce which was necessary to keep pace with our increased volumes during the year in addition to the increase in employees our costs were also impacted by a productivity decline in our platform operations that increased these costs as a percent of revenue our aggregate productive labor costs increased to 258 of revenue in 2014 as compared to 255 in 2013 while our other salaries and wages improved to 115 of revenue in 2014 as compared to 117 in 2013 

employee benefit costs increased 401 million primarily due to the increase in the number of fulltime employees eligible for benefits which led to higher payrollrelated taxes and paid time off benefits our employee benefit costs also increased for certain retirement benefit plans directly linked to the improvement in our net income and the share price of our common stock the cost for our health and dental benefit plans increased over 2013 primarily due to an increase in the total number of eligible employees in the plans this increase was partially offset by a reduction in the average cost per employee for these benefits in 2014 as compared to 2013 as a result health and dental benefit expenses decreased as a percent of salaries and wages which contributed to the overall improvement in total employee benefit costs as a percent of salaries and wages to 328 for 2014 from 346 for 2013 

operating supplies and expenses increased 475 million in 2014 as compared to 2013 although these costs as a percent of revenue improved to 155 of revenue in 2014 from 165 in 2013 the cost of diesel fuel excluding fuel taxes represents the largest component of operating supplies and expenses and can vary based on both consumption and average price per gallon our total miles in 2014 increased 164 as compared to 2013 which compares favorably to our diesel fuel consumption which increased only 130 during the same period our consumption trends continued to improve due to certain operational initiatives to increase our average miles per gallon and the increased use of new fuelefficient equipment our cost of diesel fuel excluding fuel taxes also benefited from a decrease in our average cost per gallon of 43 for 2014 from 2013 we do not use diesel fuel hedging instruments and are therefore subject to market price fluctuations other operating supplies and expenses excluding diesel fuel remained relatively consistent as a percent of revenue between the periods compared 

depreciation and amortization expense increased 194 million primarily due to the increase in depreciable assets acquired through our 2014 and 2013 capital expenditure plans as a percent of revenue our depreciation and amortization expense decreased to 53 of revenue in 2014 as compared to 54 in 2013 our capital expenditure plan for 2015 is projected to be higher than 2014 which we expect will result in increased depreciation costs in future periods while our investments increase costs in the short term we believe these investments are necessary to support our current demand and longterm growth initiatives 

purchased transportation expense increased 229 million or 215 in 2014 as compared to 2013 these costs however were relatively consistent as a percent of revenue between the periods compared we primarily utilize purchased transportation services from thirdparty providers to support our container drayage truckload brokerage and international freightforwarding services to a lesser extent we also utilize purchased transportation in our ltl operations to maximize the efficient movement of freight 

miscellaneous expenses net increased 156 million in 2014 due to changes in our gains and losses recognized on the sale of operating assets increased consulting costs associated with our ongoing technology enhancement efforts and increased legal costs net gains on the sales of operating assets in 2014 were 07 million as compared to net gains of 57 million in 2013 

our effective tax rate for 2014 was 381  as compared to 373  in 2013 our effective tax rates in 2014 and 2013 were favorably impacted by various tax credits including credits for the use of alternative fuel in operations our effective tax rate generally exceeds the federal statutory rate of 35 due to the impact of state taxes and to a lesser extent certain other nondeductible items 

2013  compared to 2012   

key financial and operating metrics for 2013  and 2012  are presented below 



our financial results for 2013 reflected the continued execution and success of our longterm strategies we increased our revenue 95 in 2013 primarily through increased market share as we continued to win share by providing a value proposition consisting of superior service at a fair and equitable price with a focus on yield management and operating efficiencies we were able to improve our margins which increased earnings per diluted share 213 as a result our operating ratio improved 110 basis points to 855 in 2013 

revenue 

our revenue increased 2031 million or 95 during 2013 which was primarily a result of increases in both ltl tonnage and price as compared to 2012 tonnage increased 56 primarily due to a 66 increase in shipments partially offset by a 10 decrease in ltl weight per shipment our tonnage growth in 2013 was primarily due to increased market share as our growth exceeded both the growth rate of the us economy as well as the growth rate for the ltl industry 

ltl revenue per hundredweight increased 38 to 1795 in 2013 which reflected our disciplined yield management process and a stable pricing environment we believe that revenue per hundredweight is a good indicator of pricing trends however we manage our yield by focusing on individual customer profitability due to the influence of various factors on revenue per hundredweight such as changes in fuel surcharges weight per shipment length of haul and mix of freight the impact of these factors can result in changes to revenue per hundredweight that do not necessarily indicate actual changes in underlying rates 

our fuel surcharges are designed to offset fluctuations in the cost of petroleumbased products and are one of the many components included in the overall negotiated price we charge for our services fuel surcharge revenue decreased to 161 of revenue in 2013 from 165 in 2012 primarily due to a slight decrease in the average price per gallon for diesel fuel most of our tariffs and contracts provide for a fuel surcharge which is recorded as additional revenue as diesel fuel prices increase above stated levels these levels are generally indexed to the doe’s published fuel prices that reset each week we regularly monitor the components of our pricing including base freight rates and fuel surcharges we also address any individual account profitability issues with our customers as part of our effort to minimize the negative impact on our profitability that would likely result from a rapid and significant change in any of our operating expenses 

operating costs and other expenses 

salaries wages and benefits increased 1042 million or 98 in 2013 due to a 722 million increase in the costs for salaries and wages and a 320 million increase in benefit costs of the total increase in salaries and wages our direct labor costs for drivers platform employees and fleet technicians increased 568 million or 100 in 2013 as compared to 2012 the increase in the costs for our salaries and wages excluding benefits was due primarily to a 75 increase in average fulltime employees over 2012 and the impact of wage increases provided to employees in september 2012 and 2013 we primarily increased our headcount in 2013 due to our increased volume of shipments as well as to ensure sufficient labor capacity for future revenue growth we also hired additional drivers in the second half of 2013 to address inefficiencies that resulted from 

changes to the fmcsa’s hoursofservice regulations although our salaries and wages excluding benefits increased during 2013 these costs decreased as a percent of revenue to 372 from 374 in 2012 as a result of increased efficiencies within our operations our platform pounds handled per hour pd stops per hour and pd shipments per hour improved 10 07 and 05 respectively over the prioryear period 

employee benefit costs increased 320 million as a result of the increase in the number of fulltime employees eligible for benefits however we also experienced a significant increase in the costs per employee for our group health and dental plans during 2013 our group health and dental costs increased 145 million or 147 in 2013 as compared to 2012 with the majority of the increase occurring in the second half of the year we experienced significant increases in both the number of claims and the average severity per claim during 2013 we believe there will be additional costs associated with the ongoing implementation of the 2010 patient protection and affordable care act and consequently we believe our group health and dental costs may continue to increase in future periods our employee benefit costs also increased for certain retirement benefit plans directly linked to the improvement in our net income and the share price of our common stock employee benefit costs as a percent of salaries and wages increased to 346 for 2013 from 337 for 2012 

operating supplies and expenses increased 67 million in 2013 as compared to 2012 these costs as a percent of revenue improved to 165 of revenue in 2013 from 177 in 2012 this improvement was primarily due to a 100 basis point decrease as a percent of revenue for our cost of diesel fuel excluding fuel taxes which is the largest component of operating supplies and expenses and can vary based on both consumption and average price per gallon much of this improvement was due to our diesel fuel consumption increasing only 35 as compared to the 63 increase in our intercity miles in 2013 our consumption trends have improved due to a focus on improving our average miles per gallon which has benefited from certain operational initiatives and the increased use of new fuelefficient equipment the average price per gallon of diesel fuel also decreased 23 as compared to 2012 we do not use diesel fuel hedging instruments and are therefore subject to market price fluctuations 

general supplies and expenses increased 109 million in 2013 primarily due to an overall increase in our marketing activities which include costs to support our brand and services our other general supplies and expenses remained relatively consistent as a percent of revenue 

depreciation and amortization expense increased to 54 of revenue in 2013 as compared to 52 in 2012 this increase was primarily due to additional depreciation recorded on the tractors and trailers purchased as part of our 2012 and 2013 capital expenditure plans our capital expenditure plan for 2014 was higher than 2013 and we expect depreciation costs to increase in future periods as a result while our investments can increase costs in the short term we believe these investments are necessary to support our longterm growth initiatives 

purchased transportation expense increased 119 million in 2013 as compared to 2012 our purchased transportation expense is primarily related to our use of thirdparty transportation providers to support our container drayage truckload brokerage and international freight forwarding operations growth in these services has resulted in the increase in our purchased transportation costs for 2013 to a lesser extent we utilized purchased transportation in our ltl operations consisting primarily of rail and truckload providers to maximize the efficient movement of freight between our service centers 

miscellaneous expenses net was impacted primarily by an increase of 57 million in gains recognized on the sale of operating assets our other miscellaneous expenses remained relatively consistent as a percent of revenue 

our effective tax rate for 2013 was 373 as compared to 380 in 2012 our effective tax rate in 2013 was favorably impacted by various tax credits including credits for the use of alternative fuel in operations provided by the american taxpayer relief act of 2012 these alternative fuel tax credits expired on december 31 2013 our effective tax rate generally exceeds the federal statutory rate of 35 due to the impact of state taxes and to a lesser extent certain other nondeductible items 

liquidity and capital resources 

a summary of our cash flows is presented below 



the changes in our cash flows provided by operating activities for the periods presented above are due primarily to the significant improvement in our net income which increased 614 million in 2014 and 367 million in 2013 over the comparable prioryear periods these increases are more fully described above in “ results of operations ” depreciation and amortization expenses also increased 194 million in 2014 and 163 million in 2013 over the comparable prioryear periods which was primarily due to the ongoing execution of our capital expenditure plan that is more fully described below  other changes in our cash flows provided by operating activities are related to various fluctuations within our working capital accounts which primarily include changes in customer receivables income taxes and certain accrued liabilities 

the changes in our cash flows used in investing activities are primarily due to fluctuations in our capital expenditure plan each year the changes in our capital expenditure plan are more fully described below in “ capital expenditures”   

the changes in our cash flows from financing activities consists primarily of scheduled principal payments under our longterm debt agreements and fluctuations in our senior unsecured revolving line of credit in addition changes in cash flows from financing activities also includes the effect of repurchases of our common stock which is more fully described below in stock repurchase program 

we have three primary sources of available liquidity cash and cash equivalents cash flows from operations and available borrowings under our senior unsecured revolving credit agreement which is described below we believe we also have sufficient access to debt and equity markets to provide other sources of liquidity 

capital expenditures 

the table below sets forth our net capital expenditures for property and equipment including those obtained through capital leases and nonmonetary exchanges for the years ended december 31 2014  2013  and 2012  



our capital expenditure requirements are generally based upon the projected increase in the number and size of our service center facilities to support our plan for longterm growth our planned tractor and trailer replacement cycle and forecasted tonnage growth expenditures for land and structures is dependent upon the availability of land in the areas we are looking to expand our capital expenditures for tractors and trailers were higher in 2014 and 2012 due to the volume of equipment scheduled for replacement in those years as well as the equipment needs for anticipated growth in tonnage we expect to continue to maintain a high level of capital expenditures in order to support our longterm plan for market share growth 

we currently estimate capital expenditures will be approximately 4633 million for the year ending december 31 2015 approximately 1647 million is allocated for the purchase of service center facilities construction of new service center facilities or expansion of existing service center facilities subject to the availability of suitable real estate and the timing of construction projects approximately 2718 million is allocated for the purchase of tractors trailers and other equipment and approximately 268 million is allocated for investments in technology and other assets we expect to fund these capital expenditures primarily through cash flows from operations our existing cash and cash equivalents and the use of our senior unsecured revolving credit facility we believe our current sources of liquidity will be sufficient to satisfy our expected capital expenditures 

we anticipate that there will be additional environmental regulations and legislation resulting from the increased regulatory focus on climate change and greenhouse gas emissions in the united states at this time we cannot predict the requirements of any future regulations however any limitations on the emission of greenhouse gases or other environmental legislation could increase our future capital expenditures and have an adverse impact on our financial condition results of operations and liquidity 

stock repurchase program 

on november 10 2014 we announced that our board of directors approved a stock repurchase program authorizing us to repurchase up to an aggregate of 2000 million of our outstanding common stock we may repurchase shares from timetotime in open market purchases or through privately negotiated transactions the program expires on november 6 2016 shares of our common stock repurchased by us under the repurchase program are canceled at the time of repurchase and are authorized but unissued shares of our common stock as of december 31 2014 we had repurchased 70620 shares for approximately 55 million and had approximately 1945 million still authorized under the program 

financing agreements 

we have a fiveyear 2000 million senior unsecured revolving credit facility pursuant to the terms of a second amended and restated credit agreement dated august 10 2011 as amended on november 7 2014 the “credit agreement” with wells fargo bank national association “wells fargo” serving as administrative agent for the lenders of the 2000 million line of credit commitments 1500 million may be used for letters of credit and 200 million may be used for borrowings under the wells fargo sweep plus loan program we utilize the sweep program to manage our daily cash needs as the sweep program automatically initiates borrowings to cover overnight cash requirements up to an aggregate of 200 million in addition we have the right to request an increase in the line of credit commitments up to a total of 3000 million in minimum increments of 250 million 

at our option revolving loans under the facility bear interest at either a the applicable margin percentage for base rate loans plus the higher of wells fargo’s prime rate the federal funds rate plus 05 per annum or the one month libor rate plus 10 per annum b the libor rate plus the applicable margin percentage for libor loans or c the libor market index rate “libor index rate” plus the applicable margin percentage for libor market index loans the applicable margin percentage is determined by a pricing grid in the credit agreement and ranges from 10  to 1875  based upon the ratio of debt to total capitalization the applicable margin percentage remained at 10  during 2014  and ranged from 10  to 1125  during 2013  revolving loans under the sweep program bear interest at the libor index rate 

the credit agreement contains customary covenants including financial covenants that require us to observe a maximum ratio of debt to total capital and a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio any future whollyowned subsidiaries of old dominion would be required to guarantee payment of all of our obligations under the facility the amounts outstanding and remaining borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facilities are presented below 



commitment fees ranging from 0175  to 030  are charged quarterly in arrears on the aggregate unutilized portion of the credit agreement based upon the ratio of debt to total capitalization letter of credit fees equal to the applicable margin for adjusted libor rate loans are charged quarterly in arrears on the daily average aggregate stated amount of all letters of credit 

outstanding during the quarter the commitment fees were 0175  during 2014  and ranged from 0175  to 02  during 2013  letter of credit fees were 10  during 2014  and ranged from 10  to 1125  during 2013  in addition the company will pay to wells fargo as issuer of letters of credit i a facing fee with respect to each letter of credit in an amount equal to 0125  of the daily average aggregate stated amount thereof payable quarterly in arrears and calculated on an actual360day basis and ii such fees and charges customarily charged in connection with the issuance and administration of such letters of credit wells fargo as administrative agent also receives an annual administrative fee for providing such services 

we have three outstanding unsecured senior note agreements with an aggregate amount outstanding of 1557 million  at december 31 2014  these notes call for periodic principal payments with maturities that range from 2015 to 2021 of which 357 million  is due in the next twelve months interest rates on these notes are fixed and range from 400 to 585 the effective average interest rate on our outstanding senior note agreements was 487  and 499  at december 31 2014  and 2013  respectively 

with the exception of borrowings pursuant to the credit agreement interest rates are fixed on all of our debt instruments therefore shortterm exposure to fluctuations in interest rates is limited to our line of credit facility we do not currently use interest rate derivative instruments to manage exposure to interest rate changes 

our credit agreement limits the amount of restricted payments including dividends andor share repurchases to i 400  million during the same fiscal quarter or ii 2000 million  in the aggregate after november 7 2014 we did not declare or pay a dividend on our common stock in 2014  or 2013  and we have no plans to declare or pay a dividend in 2015  during the fourth quarter of 2014  we repurchased 55 million of our common stock which represents the full amount repurchased under the program in 2014  our share repurchases are more fully described above in “ stock repurchase program”   

a significant decrease in demand for our services could limit our ability to generate cash flow and affect profitability most of our debt agreements have covenants that require stated levels of financial performance which if not achieved could cause acceleration of the payment schedules as of december 31 2014  we were in compliance with these covenants we do not anticipate a significant decline in business levels or financial performance that would cause us to violate any such covenants in the future and we believe the combination of our existing credit agreement along with our additional borrowing capacity will be sufficient to meet foreseeable seasonal and longterm capital needs 

contractual obligations 

the following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations as of december 31 2014  



  

 

critical accounting policies 

in preparing our financial statements we apply the following critical accounting policies that we believe affect our judgments and estimates of amounts recorded in certain assets liabilities revenue and expenses these critical accounting policies are further described in note 1 of the notes to the financial statements included in item 8 of this report 

revenue recognition 

we recognize revenue based upon when our transportation services have been completed in accordance with the bill of lading contract our general tariff provisions or contractual agreements with our customers generally this occurs when we complete the delivery of a shipment for transportation services not completed at the end of a reporting period we use a percentage of completion method to allocate the appropriate revenue to each separate reporting period under this method we develop a factor for each uncompleted shipment by dividing the actual number of days in transit at the end of a reporting period by that shipment’s standard delivery time schedule this factor is applied to the total revenue for that shipment and revenue is allocated between reporting periods accordingly 

allowances for uncollectible accounts and revenue adjustments 

we maintain an allowance for uncollectible accounts for estimated losses resulting from the failure of our customers to make required payments we estimate this allowance by analyzing the aging of our customer receivables our historical loss experience and other trends and factors affecting the credit risk of our customers we determine customer receivables to be past due when payment has not been received by the invoice due date writeoffs occur when we determine an account to be uncollectible and could differ from our allowance estimate as a result of factors such as changes in the overall economic environment or risks surrounding our customers additional allowances may be required if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments we periodically review the underlying assumptions in our estimate of the allowance for uncollectible accounts to ensure that the allowance reflects the most recent trends and factors 

we also maintain an allowance for estimated revenue adjustments resulting from future billing corrections customer allowances moneyback service guarantees and other miscellaneous revenue adjustments these revenue adjustments are recorded in our revenue from operations we use historical experience trends and current information to update and evaluate these estimates 

claims and insurance accruals 

claims and insurance accruals reflect the estimated cost of claims not covered by insurance for cargo loss and damage bipd workers’ compensation group health and dental the related costs are charged to insurance and claims expense except for workers’ compensation group health and dental which are charged to employee benefits expense 

insurers providing excess coverage above a companys selfinsured retention sir or deductible levels typically adjust their premiums to cover insured losses and for other market factors as a result we periodically evaluate our sir and deductible levels to determine the most costefficient balance between our exposure and excess coverage 

in establishing accruals for claims and expenses we evaluate and monitor each claim individually and we use factors such as historical claims development experience known trends and thirdparty estimates to determine the appropriate reserves for potential liability we believe the assumptions and methods used to estimate these liabilities are reasonable however any changes in the severity of previouslyreported claims significant changes in medical costs and regulatory changes affecting the administration of our plans could significantly impact the determination of appropriate reserves in future periods 

property and equipment 

property and equipment are recorded at cost and depreciated on a straightline basis over their estimated economic lives we use historical experience certain assumptions and estimates in determining the economic life of each asset periodically we review property and equipment for impairment due to changes in operational and market conditions and we adjust the carrying value and economic life of any impaired asset as appropriate 

estimated economic lives for structures are 7 to 30 years revenue equipment is 4 to 15 years other equipment is 2 to 20 years and leasehold improvements are the lesser of the economic life of the leasehold improvement or the remaining life of the lease the use of different assumptions estimates or significant changes in the resale market for our equipment could result in material changes in the carrying value and related depreciation of our assets 

inflation 

most of our expenses are affected by inflation which typically results in increased operating costs in response to fluctuations in the cost of petroleum products particularly diesel fuel we generally include a fuel surcharge in our tariffs and contractual agreements the fuel surcharge is designed to offset the cost of diesel fuel above a base price and fluctuates as diesel fuel prices change from the base which is generally indexed to the doe’s published fuel prices that reset each week volatility in the price of diesel fuel independent of inflation has impacted our business as described in this report however we do not believe inflation has had a material effect on our results of operations for each of the past three years 

related party transactions 

family relationships 

each of earl e congdon david s congdon and john r congdon jr are related to one another and served in various management positions andor on our board of directors during 2014 we have employment agreements with earl e congdon and david s congdon which are incorporated by reference as exhibits to this report we regularly disclose the amount of compensation that we pay to these individuals as well as any of their family members employed by us and whose compensation from time to time may require disclosure in the proxy statement for our annual meeting of shareholders 

transactions with old dominion truck leasing inc 

old dominion truck leasing inc “leasing” is a north carolina corporation whose voting stock is beneficially owned by members of the congdon family leasing is primarily engaged in the business of leasing tractors trailers and other vehicles as well as providing contract dedicated fleet services john r congdon jr serves as chairman of the board of leasing earl e congdon and david s congdon currently serve as members of leasing’s board of directors we collaborate with leasing for the purchase of certain equipment although we do not believe this has a material impact on our financial results 

we purchased 298000  299000  and 239000  of maintenance and other services from leasing in 2014  2013  and 2012  respectively we intend to continue to purchase maintenance and other services from leasing provided that leasing’s prices continue to be favorable to us 

we charged leasing 17500  18000  and 18000  for the rental of property in 2014  2013  and 2012  respectively no other services were provided to leasing for the years ended december 31 2014  2013  and 2012  

audit committee approval 

the audit committee of our board of directors reviewed and approved all of the related person transactions described above in accordance with our related person transactions policy 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact our financial position results of operations and cash flows due to adverse changes in financial market prices and rates 

we are exposed to interest rate risk directly related to loans if any under our credit agreement which have variable interest rates a 100 basis point increase in the average interest rate on this agreement would have no material effect on our operating results we have established policies and procedures to manage exposure to market risks and use major institutions that we believe are creditworthy to minimize credit risk 

we are exposed to market risk for equity investments relating to companyowned life insurance contracts on certain employees at december 31 2014  the cash value for variable life insurance contracts was 337 million of the 360 million of aggregate cash values for all life insurance contracts included on our balance sheets variable life insurance contracts expose us to fluctuations in equity markets however we utilize a thirdparty to manage these assets and minimize that exposure a 10 change in market value in those investments would have a 34 million impact on our pretax income 

we are exposed to market risk for awards granted under our employee and director phantom stock plans the liability for the unsettled outstanding awards is remeasured at the end of each reporting period based on the closing price of our common stock at that date at december 31 2014  the total liability for awards granted under our employee and director phantom stock 

plans totaled 347 million  a 10 change in the price of our common stock at december 31 2014  would have had a 35 million impact on our operating income in 2014  with respect to these plans 

we are also exposed to commodity price risk related to diesel fuel prices and manage our exposure to that risk primarily through the application of fuel surcharges to our customers 

for further discussion related to these risks see notes 2 and 7 to the financial statements included in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” and item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations”

overview 

we are a leading lessthantruckload “ltl” unionfree motor carrier providing regional interregional and national ltl service and other logistics services from a single integrated organization we are the fifth largest ltl motor carrier in the united states as measured by 2012 revenue according to transport topics  in addition to our core ltl services we offer a broad range of valueadded services including international freight forwarding ground and air expedited transportation container delivery truckload brokerage supply chain consulting warehousing and consumer household pickup and delivery our services are complemented by our technological capabilities which we believe provide the tools to improve the efficiency of our operations while empowering our customers to manage their shipping needs more than 90 of our revenue is derived from transporting ltl shipments for our customers whose demand for our services is generally tied to industrial production and the overall health of the us domestic economy 

we have increased our revenue and customer base over the past five years primarily through organic growth our infrastructure allows us to provide nextday and secondday service within each of our six regions covering the continental united states as well as interregional and national service between these regions to support our ongoing expansion we added 15 new service centers during the past five years for a total of 221  at december 31 2013  

we believe our growth can be attributed to our focus on meeting our customers’ complete supply chain needs from a single point of contact while providing a superior level of customer service at a fair and equitable price our integrated structure allows us to offer our customers consistent highquality service from origin to destination and we believe our operating structure and proprietary information systems also enable us to efficiently manage our operating costs 

we were founded in 1934 and incorporated in virginia in 1950 our principal executive offices are located at 500 old dominion way thomasville north carolina 27360 please refer to the balance sheets and statements of operations included in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” in this report for information regarding our total assets revenue from operations and net income 

our industry 

trucking companies provide transportation services to virtually every industry operating in the united states and generally offer higher levels of reliability and faster transit times than other surface transportation options the trucking industry is comprised principally of two types of motor carriers ltl and truckload ltl carriers typically pick up multiple shipments from multiple customers on a single truck and then route that freight for delivery through service centers where the freight may be transferred to other trucks with similar destinations in contrast truckload carriers generally dedicate an entire trailer to one customer from origin to destination 

according to the american trucking associations total us freight transportation revenue in 2012 was 7957 billion of which the trucking industry accounted for 807 the ltl sector had revenue in 2012 of 515 billion which represented 65 of total us freight transportation revenue in contrast to truckload carriers ltl motor carriers require expansive networks of local pickup and delivery “pd” service centers as well as larger breakbulk or hub facilities significant capital is required to create and maintain a network of service centers and a fleet of tractors and trailers the high fixed costs and capital spending requirements for ltl motor carriers make it difficult for new startup or small operators to effectively compete with established carriers in addition successful ltl motor carriers generally employ and regularly update a high level of technologybased systems and processes that provide information to customers and help reduce our operating costs 

the ltl industry is highly competitive on the basis of service and price and has consolidated significantly since the industry was deregulated in 1980 based on 2012 revenue as reported in transport topics  the largest 25 ltl motor carriers accounted for approximately 606 of the total ltl market we believe consolidation in our industry will continue due to customer demand for transportation providers offering both national and regional ltl as well as other complementary valueadded services 

competition 

we compete with regional interregional and national ltl carriers and to a lesser extent with truckload carriers small package carriers airfreight carriers and railroads we also compete with and provide transportation services to thirdparty logistics providers that determine both the mode of transportation and the carrier competition is based primarily on service price and business relationships we believe we are able to compete effectively in our markets by providing superiorquality and timely service at a fair and equitable price 

at all levels of our organization we seek to continuously improve customer service by maximizing ontime performance while reducing transit times and minimizing cargo claims we believe our transit times are generally faster than those of our principal national competitors in part because of our more efficient service center network use of team drivers and proprietary technology in addition we provide greater geographic coverage than most of our regional competitors our diversified mix and scope of regional interregional and national service combined with our valueadded service offerings enables us to provide our customers with a single source to meet their shipping and logistics needs we believe this provides us with a distinct advantage over most of our regional multiregional and national competition 

we utilize flexible scheduling and train our employees to perform multiple tasks which we believe allows us to achieve greater productivity and higher levels of customer service than our competitors we believe our focus on employee communication continued education development and motivation strengthens the relationships and trust among our employees 

we compete with several large and more diversified transportation service providers each of which may have more equipment a broader global network and a wider range of services than we have our larger competitors may also have greater financial resources and in general the ability to reduce prices to gain business especially during times of reduced growth rates in the economy 

service center operations 

at december 31 2013  we operated through 221  service center locations of which we owned 158  and leased 63  we operate a total of ten major breakbulk facilities located in rialto california atlanta georgia chicago illinois indianapolis indiana greensboro north carolina harrisburg pennsylvania memphis and morristown tennessee dallas texas and salt lake city utah while using various other service centers for limited breakbulk activity in order to serve our nextday markets our service centers are strategically located in six regions of the country so that we can provide the highest quality service and minimize freight rehandling costs 

our service centers are responsible for the pickup and delivery of freight within their service area each night our service centers load outbound freight for transport to other service centers for delivery all inbound freight received by the service center in the evening or during the night is scheduled for local delivery the next business day unless a customer requests a different delivery schedule our management reviews the productivity and service performance of each service center on a daily basis to help ensure quality service and efficient operations 

while we have established primary responsibility for customer service at the local service center level our customers may access information and initiate transactions through our centralized customer service department located at our corporate office or through several other gateways such as our website mobile applications electronic data interchange “edi” email and fax notification systems and automated voice response systems our systems offer direct access to information such as freight tracking shipping documents rate quotes rate databases and account activity these centralized systems and our customer service department provide our customers with a single point of contact to access information across all areas of our operations and for each of our service offerings 

linehaul transportation 

linehaul dispatchers control the movement of freight between service centers through integrated freight movement systems we also utilize loadplanning software to optimize efficiencies in our linehaul operations our management team monitors freight movements transit times load factors and many other productivity measurements to ensure that we maintain our high levels of service and efficiency 

we utilize scheduled routes and additional linehaul dispatches as necessary to meet our published transit times in addition we lower our cost structure by primarily using twin 28foot trailers in our linehaul operations the use of twin 28foot trailers permits us to transport freight directly from its point of origin to destination with minimal unloading and reloading which also reduces cargo loss and damage expenses we utilize longcombination vehicles such as triple 28foot trailers and combinations of 48foot and 28foot trailers in states where permitted twin trailers and longcombination vehicles permit more freight to be transported behind a tractor than could otherwise be transported by one large trailer 

tractors trailers and maintenance 

at december 31 2013  we owned 6296  tractors we generally use new tractors in linehaul operations for approximately three to five years and then transfer those tractors to pd operations for the remainder of their useful lives in many of our service centers tractors perform pd functions during the day and linehaul functions at night to maximize tractor utilization 

at december 31 2013  we owned 25052  trailers we primarily purchase new trailers for our operations however we occasionally purchase preowned equipment that meets our specifications the purchase of preowned equipment can provide an excellent value but also can increase our fleet’s average age the table below reflects as of december 31 2013  the average age of our tractors and trailers 



we develop certain specifications for tractors and trailers and then negotiate the production and purchase of this equipment with several manufacturers these purchases are planned well in advance of anticipated delivery dates in order to accommodate manufacturers’ production schedules we believe there is sufficient capacity among suppliers to ensure an uninterrupted supply of equipment to support our operations 

the table below sets forth our capital expenditures for tractors and trailers for the years ended december 31 2013  2012  and 2011  for more information concerning our capital expenditures see item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations – liquidity and capital resources ” in this report 



at december 31 2013  we operated 38 maintenance centers at certain service center locations throughout our network these maintenance centers are equipped to perform routine and preventive maintenance and repairs on our equipment 

we adhere to established maintenance policies and procedures to help ensure our fleet is properly maintained tractors are routed to appropriate maintenance facilities at designated mileage intervals or 90 days whichever occurs first trailers are scheduled for maintenance every 90 days 

customers 

revenue is generated by customers dispersed primarily throughout the united states and north america in 2013  our largest customer accounted for approximately 26 of our revenue and our largest 5 10 and 20 customers accounted for approximately 94 143 and 212 of our revenue respectively for each of the previous three years more than 90 of our revenue was derived from transporting ltl shipments for our customers and less than 5 of our revenue was generated from international services we believe the diversity of our customer base helps protect our business from adverse developments in a single geographic region and from the reduction or loss of business from a single customer 

we utilize an integrated freightcosting system to determine the price level at which a particular shipment of freight will be profitable we can modify elements of this freightcosting model to simulate the actual conditions under which the freight will be moved many of our customers engage our services through the terms and provisions of our tariffs and through negotiated service contracts we also compete for business by participating in bid solicitations customers generally solicit bids for relatively large numbers of shipments for a period of one to two years and typically choose to enter into contractual arrangements with a limited number of motor carriers based upon price and service 

seasonality 

our operations are subject to seasonal trends common in the trucking industry our operating margins in the first quarter are normally lower due to reduced demand during the winter months harsh weather can also adversely affect our performance by reducing demand and reducing our ability to transport freight which could result in decreased revenue and increased operating expenses 

technology 

we continually upgrade and enhance our technological capabilities and we provide access to our systems through multiple gateways that offer our customers maximum flexibility and immediate access to information we employ vehicle safety systems onboard and handheld computer systems freight handling systems and logistics technology to reduce costs and transit times we continue to focus on the development and enhancement of the technology used in our operations in order to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of our services 

insurance 

we carry a significant amount of insurance with thirdparty insurance carriers but we are exposed to the risk of loss on claims up to the limit for which we hold either a selfinsured retention sir or deductible at december 31 2013  the amounts for our sir andor deductibles were as follows 275 million per occurrence for bodily injury and property damage “bipd” claims 100000 per claim for cargo loss and damage 10 million per occurrence for workers’ compensation claims and 400000 per occurrence with a 400000 aggregate over our retention level for group health claims 

we believe that our policy of maintaining an sir or deductible for a portion of our risks supported by our safety and loss prevention programs is an effective means of managing insurance costs we periodically review our risks and insurance coverage applicable to those risks and we believe that we maintain sufficient insurance coverage 

diesel fuel availability and cost 

our industry depends heavily upon the availability of diesel fuel although we currently maintain fuel storage and pumping facilities at 58 or 26 of our service center locations we may be susceptible to fuel shortages at certain locations that could cause us to incur additional expense to help ensure adequate supply on a timely basis to prevent a disruption to our service schedules 

diesel fuel costs including fuel taxes totaled 132 143 and 149 of revenue in 2013  2012  and 2011  respectively we believe our operations and financial condition are susceptible to the same diesel fuel price increases or shortages as those of our competitors we implemented a fuel surcharge program in august 1999 which has remained in effect since that time and is one of many components that we use to determine the overall price for our transportation services our fuel surcharges are generally indexed to fuel prices published by the us department of energy the “doe” that reset each week 

employees 

as of december 31 2013  we employed 14073  individuals on a fulltime basis none of which were represented under a collective bargaining agreement our fulltime employees work in the following roles 



as of december 31 2013  we employed 3791 linehaul drivers and 3689 pd drivers on a fulltime basis we select our drivers primarily based upon safe driving records and experience among other requirements our drivers must pass a drug test have a current us department of transportation “dot” physical and have a valid commercial driver’s license prior to employment once employed drivers are required to obtain and maintain hazardous materials endorsements to their commercial driver’s licenses drivers as well as all employees are required to take preemployment drug and alcohol tests and are randomly selected for periodic additional testing 

since 1988 we have provided the opportunity for qualified employees to become drivers through the “old dominion driver training program” there are currently 1975 active drivers who have successfully completed this training which was approximately 26 of our driver workforce as of december 31 2013  we believe our driver training and qualification programs have been important factors in improving our safety record and retaining qualified drivers we reward our drivers who maintain safe driving records through bonuses of up to 3000 per driver payable each year our driver safety bonuses totaled 28 million 26 million and 23 million in 2013  2012  and 2011  respectively in addition we have experienced an annual turnover rate for our driver graduates of approximately 60 which is below our companywide turnover rate for all drivers of approximately 104 

at december 31 2013  we had a sales staff of 518  employees we compensate our sales force in part based upon certain operating metrics to help motivate our sales employees to achieve our service growth and profitability objectives 

governmental regulation 

we are subject to regulation by many federal governmental agencies including the federal motor carrier safety administration the “fmcsa” the pipeline and hazardous materials safety agency and the surface transportation board which are agencies within the dot we are also subject to rules and regulations of various state agencies these regulatory authorities have broad powers generally governing matters such as authority to engage in motor carrier operations motor carrier registration driver hours of service safety and fitness of transportation equipment and drivers certain mergers 

consolidations and acquisitions and periodic financial reporting in addition we are subject to compliance with cargosecurity and transportation regulations issued by the transportation security administration tsa within the us department of homeland security 

in october 2009 the us court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit ordered the fmcsa to review and reissue rules governing hours of service for commercial truck drivers by july 26 2011 this deadline was extended and on december 22 2011 the fmcsa issued its final rule which mandated compliance by july 1 2013 the final rule reduces the maximum number of hours a truck driver can work each week to 70 hours from the former 82hour limit the rule maintains a maximum 11hour daily driving limit but requires drivers to take a 30minute break prior to working beyond eight hours the rule also includes changes to the “34hour restart” provision implementation of the new rule has required certain changes in our operating procedures and has increased our operating costs by limiting the productivity of our drivers as a result we have hired additional drivers to supplement our labor requirements which have increased our costs while we are unable to fully quantify all of the effects of implementing the new rule we do not believe these additional costs had a material impact on our operating costs we are however subject to future rulemaking by the fmcsa and other regulatory agencies which could be more stringent require additional changes to our operations increase our operating costs or otherwise adversely impact our results of operations 

the trucking industry is subject to regulatory and legislative changes from a variety of other governmental authorities which address matters such as i increasingly stringent environmental and occupational safety and health regulations ii limits on vehicle weight and size iii ergonomics iv port security and v hours of service these changes may affect our business or the economics of our industry by requiring changes in operating practices or by influencing the demand for and increasing the costs of providing our services 

environmental regulation 

we are subject to various federal state and local environmental laws and regulations that focus on among other things the emission and discharge of hazardous materials into the environment or their presence at our properties or in our vehicles fuel storage tanks transportation of certain materials and the discharge or retention of storm water under specific environmental laws we could also be held responsible for any costs relating to contamination at our past or present facilities and at thirdparty waste disposal sites as well as costs associated with cleanup of accidents involving our vehicles we do not believe that the cost of future compliance with current environmental laws or regulations will have a material adverse effect on our operations financial condition competitive position or capital expenditures for the remainder of 2014 however future changes to laws or regulations may adversely affect our operations and could result in unforeseen costs to our business

 item 1a risk factors 

various factors exist that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those projected in any forwardlooking statement in addition to the factors discussed elsewhere in this report we believe the following are some of the important risks and uncertainties that could materially affect our business financial condition or results of operations 

we operate in a highly competitive industry and our business will suffer if we are unable to adequately address potential downward pricing pressures and other factors that may adversely affect our operations and profitability 

numerous competitive factors could impair our ability to maintain our current profitability these factors include but are not limited to the following 

 9 

 

if we are unable to effectively compete with other ltl carriers whether on the basis of price service or otherwise we may be unable to retain existing customers or attract new customers either of which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

if our employees were to unionize our operating costs would increase and our ability to compete would be impaired 

none of our employees are currently represented under a collective bargaining agreement however from time to time there have been efforts to organize our employees at various service centers further congress or one or more states could approve legislation andor the national labor relations board could render decisions or implement rule changes that could significantly affect our business and our relationship with our employees including actions that could substantially liberalize the procedures for union organization in addition we can offer no assurance that the department of labor will not adopt new regulations or interpret existing regulations in a manner that would favor the agenda of unions or that our employees will not unionize in the future particularly if regulatory changes occur that facilitate unionization 

the unionization of our employees could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations because 

 

if we are unable to successfully execute our growth strategy our business and future results of operations may suffer 

our growth strategy includes increasing the volume of freight moving through our existing service center network selectively expanding our geographic footprint and broadening the scope of our service offerings in connection with our growth strategy at various times we have made selective acquisitions purchased additional equipment expanded and upgraded service centers and increased our sales and marketing efforts and we expect to continue to do so our growth strategy exposes us to a number of risks including the following 

 

we cannot assure that we will overcome the risks associated with our growth strategy if we fail to overcome those risks we may not realize additional revenue or profits from our efforts we may incur additional expenses and therefore our financial position and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 

we may be unable to successfully consummate and integrate acquisitions as part of our growth strategy 

growth through acquisitions has been a key component of our ltl growth strategy throughout our history in the future we may seek to acquire other ltl carriers as well as other complementary businesses exploration of potential acquisitions requires significant attention from our senior management team in addition we expect to compete for acquisition opportunities with other companies some of which may have greater financial and other resources than we do we cannot assure that we will 

have sufficient cash with which to consummate an acquisition or otherwise be able to obtain financing for any acquisition if we are unable to access sufficient funding for potential acquisitions we may not be able to complete transactions that we otherwise find advantageous 

any subsequent acquisition will entail numerous risks including 

 

in addition we may have difficulty integrating any acquired business and its operations services and personnel into our existing operations and such integration may require a significant amount of time and effort by our management team to the extent we do not successfully avoid or overcome the risks or problems resulting from any acquisitions we undertake there could be a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our customers’ and suppliers’ business may be impacted by a downturn in the economy andor a disruption of financial markets which may decrease demand for our services 

adverse economic conditions can negatively affect our customers’ business levels the amount of transportation services they need their ability to pay for our services and overall freight levels all of which might impair our asset utilization customers encountering adverse economic conditions may be unable to obtain additional financing or financing under acceptable terms due to disruptions in the capital and credit markets these customers represent a greater potential for bad debt losses which may require us to increase our reserve for bad debt economic conditions resulting in bankruptcies of one or more of our large customers could have a significant impact on our financial position results of operations or liquidity in a particular year or quarter further when adverse economic times arise customers may bid out freight or select competitors that offer lower rates in an attempt to lower their costs and we might be forced to lower our rates or lose freight 

our suppliers’ business levels also may be negatively affected by adverse economic conditions or financial constraints which could lead to disruptions in the supply and availability of equipment parts and services critical to our operations a significant interruption in our normal supply chain could disrupt our operations increase our costs and negatively impact our ability to serve our customers 

we also are subject to cost increases outside of our control that could materially reduce our profitability if we are unable to increase our rates sufficiently such cost increases include but are not limited to increases in fuel prices driver wages interest rates taxes tolls license and registration fees insurance revenue equipment and healthcare for our employees 

increases in driver compensation or other difficulties attracting and retaining qualified drivers could adversely affect our profitability and ability to maintain or grow our fleet 

from time to time we have experienced difficulty in attracting and retaining sufficient numbers of qualified drivers and such shortages may recur in the future because of the intense competition for drivers we may face difficulty maintaining or increasing our number of drivers the compensation we offer our drivers is subject to market conditions that may require increases in driver compensation which becomes more likely as economic conditions improve if we are unable to attract and retain a sufficient number of drivers we could be required to adjust our compensation packages or operate with fewer trucks and face difficulty meeting shipper demands all of which could adversely affect our profitability and ability to maintain our size or grow 

insurance and claims expenses could significantly reduce our profitability 

we are exposed to claims related to cargo loss and damage property damage personal injury workers’ compensation group health and group dental we have insurance coverage with thirdparty insurance carriers but we assume a significant portion of the risk associated with these claims due to our sirs and deductibles our operating results would be adversely affected if any of the following were to occur i the number or severity of claims increases ii we are required to accrue or pay additional amounts because the claims prove to be more severe than our original assessment or iii claims exceed our excess coverage amounts if claims exceed our retention or deductible levels or insurance market conditions change insurers could raise premiums for excess coverage to cover their expenses and anticipated future losses in addition insurance companies require us to obtain letters of credit to collateralize our retention or deductible levels if these requirements increase our borrowing capacity could be adversely affected 

healthcare legislation may increase our costs and reduce our future profitability 

to attract and retain employees we maintain a competitive health insurance plan for our employees and their dependents the patient protection and affordable care act which was signed into law in 2010 and has several provisions not yet in effect is expected to increase our annual employee healthcare costs going forward we cannot predict the impact that this legislation or any future state or federal healthcare legislation or regulation will have on our operations however rising healthcare costs and universal healthcare coverage in the united states could result in significant longterm costs to us which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results in addition rising healthcare costs could force us to make further changes to our benefits program which could negatively impact our ability to attract and retain employees 

we have significant ongoing cash requirements that could limit our growth and affect our profitability if we are unable to obtain sufficient capital 

our business is highly capital intensive we generally finance our capital expenditures and planned growth with existing cash cash flow from operations issuance of debt and through available borrowings under our existing senior unsecured credit agreement we may require additional capital to finance longterm real estate purchase opportunities and acquisitions which we may fund through additional debt or through equity offerings if we are unable in the future to generate sufficient cash from our operations or raise capital by accessing the debt and equity markets we may be forced to limit our growth and operate our equipment for longer periods of time which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results 

our business also has significant ongoing operating cash requirements if our cash requirements are high or our cash flow from operations is low during particular periods we may need to seek additional financing which could be costly or difficult to obtain 

limited supply and increased prices for new equipment may adversely affect our earnings and cash flow 

we may face difficulty in purchasing new equipment due to decreased supply and increased costs investment in new equipment is a significant part of our annual capital expenditures and we require an available supply of tractors and trailers from equipment manufacturers to operate and grow our business we are also subject to shortages in raw materials that are required for the production of critical operating equipment and supplies such as shortages in rubber or steel 

the price of our equipment may also be adversely affected in the future by regulations on newly manufactured tractors and diesel engines we have incurred significant increases in the cost of tractors due to regulations issued by the us environmental protection agency the “epa” and various state agencies that require progressive reductions in exhaust emissions from diesel engines beginning in october 2002 new diesel engines were required to meet these new emission limits some of the regulations required reductions in the sulfur content of diesel fuel beginning in june 2006 and the introduction of emissions aftertreatment devices on newlymanufactured engines and vehicles beginning with modelyear 2007 the final phase of these regulations required reduced nitrogen and nonmethane hydrocarbon emissions beginning with modelyear 2010 beginning in 2013 these regulations also required that all heavyduty diesel engines built for highway applications over 14000 pounds include certified onboard diagnostics systems to monitor emissions these regulations have resulted in higher prices for tractors and diesel engines and increased operating and maintenance costs and there can be no assurance that continued increases in pricing or costs will not have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

we may be adversely impacted by fluctuations in the availability and price of diesel fuel 

diesel fuel is a critical component of our operations and a significant operating expense for our business diesel fuel prices and fuel availability can be impacted by factors beyond our control such as natural or manmade disasters adverse weather conditions political events price and supply decisions by oil producing countries and cartels terrorist activities armed conflict and world supply and demand imbalances we maintain fuel storage and pumping facilities at many of our service center locations however we may be susceptible to fuel shortages at certain locations that could cause us to incur additional expense to ensure adequate supply on a timely basis to prevent a disruption to our service schedules an interruption in the supply of diesel fuel could have a material adverse effect on our operating results 

we do not hedge against the risk of diesel fuel price increases an increase in diesel fuel prices or diesel fuel taxes or any change in federal or state regulations that results in such an increase could have a material adverse effect on our operating results we have fuel surcharge programs in place with a majority of our customers which help offset the negative impact of the increased cost of diesel fuel and other petroleumbased products however we also incur fuel costs that cannot be recovered even with respect to customers with which we maintain fuel surcharge programs such as those costs associated with empty miles or the time when our engines are idling because our fuel surcharge recovery lags behind changes in fuel prices our fuel surcharge recovery may not capture the increased costs we pay for fuel especially when prices are rising leading to fluctuations in our levels of reimbursement we regularly monitor the components of our pricing including fuel surcharges and address individual account profitability issues with our customers when necessary however there can be no assurance that fuel surcharges can be maintained indefinitely or will be sufficiently effective in offsetting increases in diesel fuel prices 

we are subject to various environmental laws and regulations and costs of compliance with liabilities under or violations of existing or future environmental laws or regulations could adversely affect our business 

we are subject to various federal state and local environmental laws and regulations that govern among other things the emission and discharge of hazardous materials into the environment the presence of hazardous materials at our properties or in our vehicles fuel storage tanks the transportation of certain materials and the discharge or retention of storm water under certain environmental laws we could also be held responsible for any costs relating to contamination at our past or present facilities and at thirdparty waste disposal sites as well as costs associated with the cleanup of accidents involving our vehicles environmental laws have become and are expected to continue to be increasingly more stringent over time and there can be no assurance that our costs of complying with current or future environmental laws or liabilities arising under such laws will not have a material adverse effect on our business operations or financial condition 

in addition to the epa regulations on exhaust emissions with which we must comply there is an increased regulatory focus on climate change and greenhouse gas emissions in the united states as a result we may become subject to additional legislation or rulemaking that could adversely impact our business any future limitations on the emission of greenhouse gases or other environmental legislation could increase our future capital expenditures and have an adverse impact on our financial condition results of operations and liquidity 

we are subject to the risks of litigation and governmental proceedings which could adversely affect our business 

we are and in the future may be subject to legal and governmental proceedings and claims the parties in such legal actions may seek amounts from us that may not be covered in whole or in part by insurance defending ourselves against such legal actions could result in significant costs and could require a substantial amount of time and effort by our management team we cannot predict the outcome of litigation or governmental proceedings to which we are a party or whether we will be subject to future legal actions as a result the potential costs associated with legal actions against us could adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations 

we are subject to various risks arising from our international business operations and relationships which could adversely affect our business 

we arrange for transportation and logistics services to and from various international locations and are subject to both the risks of conducting international business and the requirements of the foreign corrupt practices act of 1977 the fcpa failure to comply with the fcpa may result in legal claims against us in addition we face other risks associated with international operations and relationships which may include restrictive trade policies imposition of duties taxes or government royalties imposed by foreign governments 

we operate in a highly regulated industry and increased costs of compliance with or liability for violation of existing or future regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business 

we are regulated by the dot and by various state agencies these regulatory authorities have broad powers generally governing matters such as authority to engage in motor carrier operations as well as motor carrier registration driver hours of service safety and fitness of transportation equipment and drivers transportation of hazardous materials certain mergers and acquisitions and periodic financial reporting in addition the trucking industry is subject to regulatory and legislative changes from a variety of other governmental authorities which address matters such as i increasingly stringent environmental occupational safety and health regulations ii limits on vehicle weight and size iii ergonomics iv port security and v hours of service in addition we are subject to compliance with cargosecurity and transportation regulations issued by the tsa within the us department of homeland security regulatory requirements and changes in regulatory requirements may affect our business or the economics of the industry by requiring changes in operating practices or by influencing the demand for and increasing the costs of providing transportation services 

in october 2009 the us court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit ordered the fmcsa to review and reissue rules governing hours of service for commercial truck drivers by july 26 2011 this deadline was extended and on december 22 2011 the fmcsa issued its final rule which mandated compliance by july 1 2013 the final rule reduces the maximum number of hours a truck driver can work each week to 70 hours from the former 82hour limit the rule maintains a maximum 11hour daily driving limit but requires drivers to take a 30minute break prior to working beyond eight hours the rule also includes changes to the “34hour restart” provision implementation of the new rule has required certain changes in 

our operating procedures and increased our operating costs by limiting the productivity of our drivers as a result we have hired additional drivers to supplement our labor requirements which have increased our costs while we are unable to fully quantify all of the effects of implementing the new rule we do not believe these additional costs had a material impact on our operating costs we are however subject to future rulemaking by the fmcsa and other regulatory agencies which could be more stringent require additional changes to our operations increase our operating costs or otherwise adversely impact our results of operations 

the fmcsa’s compliance safety accountability initiative “csa” could adversely impact our ability to hire qualified drivers meet our growth projections and maintain our customer relationships each of which could adversely impact our results of operations 

the csa includes compliance and enforcement initiatives designed to monitor and improve commercial motor vehicle safety by measuring the safety record of both the motor carrier and the driver these measurements are scored and used by the fmcsa to identify potential safety risks and to direct enforcement action csa scores for transportation companies are currently available on the fmcsa’s website 

our csa scores are dependent upon our safety and compliance experience which could change at any time in addition the safety standards prescribed in csa could change and our ability to maintain an acceptable score could be adversely impacted if we receive an unacceptable csa score our relationships with our customers could be damaged which could result in a loss of business 

the requirements of csa could shrink the industry’s pool of drivers as those with unfavorable scores could leave the industry as a result the costs to attract train and retain qualified drivers could increase in addition a shortage of qualified drivers could increase driver turnover decrease asset utilization limit growth and adversely impact our results of operations 

our results of operations may be affected by seasonal factors and harsh weather conditions 

our operations are subject to seasonal trends common in the trucking industry our operating margins in the first quarter are normally lower due to reduced demand during the winter months harsh weather can also adversely affect our performance by reducing demand and reducing our ability to transport freight which could result in decreased revenue and increased operating expenses 

if we are unable to retain our key employees our financial condition results of operations and liquidity could be adversely affected 

our success will continue to depend upon the experience and leadership of our key employees and executive officers in that regard the loss of the services of any of our key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and liquidity 

our principal shareholders control a large portion of our outstanding common stock 

earl e congdon david s congdon john r congdon jr and members of their respective families beneficially own an aggregate of approximately 27 of the outstanding shares of our common stock as long as the congdon family controls a large portion of our voting stock they may be able to significantly influence the election of the entire board of directors and the outcome of all matters involving a shareholder vote the congdon family’s interests may differ from the interests of other shareholders and the status of their ownership could change at their discretion 

our financial results may be adversely impacted by potential future changes in accounting practices 

future changes in accounting standards or practices and related legal and regulatory interpretations of those changes may adversely impact public companies in general the transportation industry or our operations specifically new accounting standards or requirements such as a conversion from us generally accepted accounting principles to international financial reporting standards could change the way we record revenues expenses assets andor liabilities or could be costly to implement these types of regulations could have a negative impact on our financial position liquidity results of operations andor access to capital 

our information technology systems are subject to certain risks that we cannot control 

we are reliant on our information systems for our operations as well as providing a valueadded service to our customers our information systems including our accounting systems are dependent upon thirdparty software global communications providers data network systems and other aspects of technology and internet infrastructure that are susceptible to failure or an adverse cyber incident although we have implemented redundant systems and network security measures our information technology remains susceptible to interruptions caused by natural disasters outages computer viruses breakins and similar disruptions such an event could inhibit our ability to provide services to our customers and the ability of our customers to access our systems in addition there could be a loss of confidential information corruption of data and damage to our brand image this may result in a reduction in demand for our services or the loss of customers that could have a negative impact on our financial condition results of operations and liquidity 

misuse of social media outlets could damage our reputation and adversely affect our financial condition  

customers competitors employees and other individuals continue to increase the use of social media outlets and we maintain and manage our own corporate presence through various social media outlets we support new ways of sharing data and communicating through these social media outlets however information distributed via social networking could result in unfavorable publicity about us being disseminated quickly and broadly this unfavorable publicity could damage our reputation and may result in a reduction in demand for our services or the loss of customers that could have a negative impact on our financial condition results of operations and liquidity 

a decrease in the demand and value of used equipment may impact our results of operations 

as we purchase new tractors as part of our normal replacement cycle each year we rely on the used equipment market to dispose of our older equipment oversupply in the transportation industry as well as adverse domestic and foreign economic conditions can negatively impact the demand for used tractors and therefore reduce the value we can obtain on our used equipment if we are unable to sell our older equipment at or above salvage value the resulting losses could have a significant impact on our results of operations 

if we raise additional capital in the future your ownership in us could be diluted 

any issuance of equity we may undertake in the future to raise additional capital could cause the price of our common stock to decline or require us to issue shares at a price that is lower than that paid by holders of our common stock in the past which would result in those newly issued shares being dilutive if we obtain funds through a credit facility or through the issuance of debt or preferred securities these obligations and securities would likely have rights senior to your rights as a common shareholder which could impair the value of our common stock 

the market value of our common stock may fluctuate and could be substantially affected by various factors 

the price of our common stock on the nasdaq global select market constantly changes we expect that the market price of our common stock will continue to fluctuate as a result of a variety of factors many of which are beyond our control these factors include among others 

 

our common stock price may fluctuate significantly in the future and these fluctuations may be unrelated to our performance general market price declines or market volatility in the future could adversely affect the price of our common stock and the current market price of our common stock may not be indicative of future market prices 

our articles of incorporation our bylaws and virginia law contain provisions that could discourage delay or prevent a change in our control or our management 

provisions of our articles of incorporation bylaws and the laws of virginia the state in which we are incorporated may discourage delay or prevent a change in control of us or a change in management that shareholders may consider favorable these provisions 

 

these provisions could discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for you and other shareholders to take certain corporate actions these provisions could also limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock

 item 2 properties 

we own our principal executive office located in thomasville north carolina consisting of a twostory office building of approximately 160000 square feet on 301 acres of land at december 31 2013  we operated 221  service centers of which 158  were owned and 63  were leased our service centers that are owned include most of our larger facilities and account for 835 of the total door capacity in our network with the exception of our chicago illinois facility which has a lease that expires in 2021 we own our major breakbulk facilities each of our major breakbulk facilities is listed below with the number of doors as of december 31 2013  



our 221  facilities are strategically dispersed over the states in which we operate at december 31 2013  the terms of our leased properties ranged from monthtomonth to a lease that expires in 2023 we believe that as current leases expire we will be able to renew them or find comparable facilities without incurring any material negative impact on service to our customers or our operating results 

we also own 18 nonoperating service center properties eleven of these properties are leased to third parties with lease terms that range from monthtomonth to a lease that expires in 2017 

we believe that all of our properties are in good repair and are capable of providing the level of service required by current business levels and customer demands in addition we believe we have sufficient capacity in our service center network to accommodate a substantial increase in demand for our services 




 item 3 legal proceedings 

we are involved in various legal proceedings and claims that have arisen in the ordinary course of our business that have not been fully adjudicated some of which are covered in part by insurance our management does not believe that these actions when finally concluded and determined will have a material adverse effect upon our financial position liquidity or results of operations

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

overview 

we are a leading lessthantruckload “ltl” unionfree motor carrier providing regional interregional and national ltl service and other logistics services from a single integrated organization in addition to our core ltl services we offer a broad range of valueadded services including international freight forwarding ground and air expedited transportation container delivery truckload brokerage supply chain consulting warehousing and consumer household pickup and delivery more than 90 of our revenue has historically been derived from transporting ltl shipments for our customers whose demand for our services is generally tied to industrial production and the overall health of the us domestic economy 

in analyzing the components of our revenue we monitor changes and trends in the following key metrics 

 

revenue per hundredweight is a commonlyused indicator of pricing trends but this metric can be influenced by many other factors such as changes in fuel surcharges weight per shipment length of haul and the class or mix of our freight as a result changes in revenue per hundredweight do not necessarily indicate actual changes in underlying base rates 

 

 

our primary revenue focus is to increase “density” which is shipment and tonnage growth within our existing infrastructure that is measured by our revenue per service center increases in density allow us to maximize our asset utilization and labor productivity which we measure over many different functional areas of our operations including linehaul load factor pickup and delivery “pd” stops per hour pd shipments per hour platform pounds handled per hour and platform shipments per hour in addition to our focus on density and operating efficiencies it is critical for us to obtain an appropriate yield on the shipments we handle we manage our yields by focusing on individual account profitability we believe yield management and improvements in efficiency are key components in our ability to produce profitable growth 

our primary cost elements are direct wages and benefits associated with the movement of freight fuel and equipment repair expenses and depreciation of our equipment fleet and service center facilities we gauge our overall success in managing these costs by monitoring our operating ratio a measure of profitability calculated by dividing total operating expenses by revenue which also allows industrywide comparisons with our competition 

we continually upgrade our technological capabilities to improve our customer service and lower our operating costs our technology provides our customers with visibility of their shipments throughout our network increases the productivity of our workforce and provides key metrics from which we can monitor our processes 

results of operations 

the following table sets forth for the years indicated expenses and other items as a percentage of revenue from operations 

  

  

 

   

2013  compared to 2012   

key financial and operating metrics for 2013  and 2012  are presented below 



our financial results for 2013 reflect the continued execution and success of our longterm strategies we increased our revenue 95 in 2013 primarily through increased market share as we continued to win share by providing a value proposition consisting of superior service at a fair and equitable price with a focus on yield management and operating efficiencies we were able to improve our margins which increased earnings per diluted share 213 as a result our operating ratio improved by over 100 basis points for the fourth straight year to 855 which is the best annual operating ratio our company has ever produced 

revenue 

our revenue increased 2031 million or 95 during 2013 which was a result of increases in both tonnage and price as compared to 2012 tonnage increased 74 primarily due to a 66 increase in shipments and a 07 increase in weight per shipment our tonnage growth in 2013 was primarily due to increased market share as our growth exceeded both the growth rate of the us economy as well as the growth rate for the ltl industry 

revenue per hundredweight increased 21 to 1585 in 2013 which reflects our disciplined yield management process and a stable pricing environment we believe that revenue per hundredweight is a good indicator of pricing trends however we manage our yield by focusing on individual customer profitability due to the influence of various factors on revenue per hundredweight such as changes in fuel surcharges weight per shipment length of haul and mix of freight the impact of these factors can result in changes to revenue per hundredweight that do not necessarily indicate actual changes in underlying rates 

our fuel surcharges are designed to offset fluctuations in the cost of petroleumbased products and are one of the many components included in the overall negotiated price we charge for our services fuel surcharge revenue decreased to 161 of revenue in 2013 from 165 in 2012 primarily due to a slight decrease in the average price per gallon for diesel fuel most of our tariffs and contracts provide for a fuel surcharge which is recorded as additional revenue as diesel fuel prices increase above stated levels these levels are generally indexed to the doe’s published fuel prices that reset each week we regularly monitor the components of our pricing including base freight rates and fuel surcharges we also address any individual account profitability issues with our customers as part of our effort to minimize the negative impact on our profitability that would likely result from a rapid and significant change in any of our operating expenses 

operating costs and other expenses 

salaries wages and benefits increased 1042 million or 98 in 2013 due to a 722 million increase in the costs for salaries and wages and a 320 million increase in benefit costs of the total increase in salaries and wages our direct labor costs for drivers platform employees and fleet technicians increased 568 million or 100 in 2013 as compared to 2012 the increase in the costs for our salaries and wages excluding benefits was due primarily to a 75 increase in average fulltime employees over 2012 and the impact of wage increases provided to employees in september 2012 and 2013 we primarily increased our headcount in 2013 due to our increased volume of shipments as well as to ensure sufficient labor capacity for future revenue growth we also hired additional drivers in the second half of 2013 to address inefficiencies that resulted from changes to the fmcsa’s hoursofservice regulations although our salaries and wages excluding benefits increased during 2013 these costs decreased as a percent of revenue to 372 from 374 in 2012 as a result of increased efficiencies within our operations our platform pounds handled per hour pd stops per hour and pd shipments per hour improved 10 07 and 05 respectively over the prioryear period 

employee benefit costs increased 320 million as a result of the increase in the number of fulltime employees eligible for benefits however we also experienced a significant increase in the costs per employee for our group health and dental plans during 2013 our group health and dental costs increased 145 million or 147 in 2013 as compared to 2012 with the majority of the increase occurring in the second half of the year we experienced significant increases in both the number of claims and the average severity per claim during 2013 we believe there will be additional costs associated with the ongoing implementation of the 2010 patient protection and affordable care act and consequently we believe our group health and dental costs may continue to increase in future periods our employee benefit costs also increased for certain retirement benefit plans directly linked to the improvement in our net income and the share price of our common stock employee benefit costs as a percent of salaries and wages increased to 346 for 2013 from 337 for 2012 

operating supplies and expenses increased 67 million in 2013 as compared to 2012 these costs as a percent of revenue improved to 165 of revenue in 2013 from 177 in 2012 this improvement is primarily due to a 100 basis point decrease as a percent of revenue for our cost of diesel fuel excluding fuel taxes which is the largest component of operating supplies and expenses and can vary based on both consumption and average price per gallon much of this improvement is due to our diesel fuel consumption increasing only 35 as compared to the 63 increase in our intercity miles in 2013 our consumption trends have improved due to a focus on improving our average miles per gallon which has benefited from certain operational initiatives and the increased use of new fuelefficient equipment the average price per gallon of diesel fuel also decreased 23 as compared to 2012 we do not use diesel fuel hedging instruments and are therefore subject to market price fluctuations 

general supplies and expenses increased 109 million in 2013 primarily due to an overall increase in our marketing activities which include costs to support our brand and services our other general supplies and expenses remained relatively consistent as a percent of revenue 

depreciation and amortization expense increased to 54 of revenue in 2013 as compared to 52 in 2012 this increase was primarily due to additional depreciation recorded on the tractors and trailers purchased as part of our 2012 and 2013 capital expenditure plans our capital expenditure plan for 2014 is projected to be higher than 2013 and we expect depreciation costs to increase in future periods as a result while our investments can increase costs in the short term we believe these investments are necessary to support our longterm growth initiatives 

purchased transportation expense increased 119 million in 2013 as compared to 2012 our purchased transportation expense is primarily related to our use of thirdparty transportation providers to support our container drayage truckload brokerage and international freight forwarding operations growth in these services has resulted in the increase in our purchased transportation costs for 2013 to a lesser extent we utilized purchased transportation in our ltl operations consisting primarily of rail and truckload providers to maximize the efficient movement of freight between our service centers 

miscellaneous expenses net was impacted primarily by an increase of 57 million in gains recognized on the sale of operating assets our other miscellaneous expenses remained relatively consistent as a percent of revenue 

our effective tax rate for 2013 was 373  as compared to 380  in 2012 our effective tax rate in 2013 was favorably impacted by various tax credits including credits for the use of alternative fuel in operations provided by the american taxpayer relief act of 2012 these alternative fuel tax credits expired on december 31 2013 our effective tax rate generally exceeds the federal statutory rate of 35 due to the impact of state taxes and to a lesser extent certain other nondeductible items 

2012  compared to 2011   

key financial and operating metrics for 2012  and 2011  are presented below 



our 2012 financial results were driven by strong growth in our revenue which exceeded 20 billion for the first time in our companys history we experienced strong growth in both tonnage and revenue per hundredweight while also improving the efficiency of our operations all of which led to margin improvement over the previous year as a result our operating ratio improved to 866 and net income increased 215 to 1695 million for 2012 

we believe our success in 2012 was primarily the result of our ability to win market share by providing shippers with a value proposition that consists of providing bestinclass ontime and claimsfree service at a fair and equitable price our commitment to this value proposition should allow us to continue to increase our tonnage and market share 

revenue 

our revenue growth during 2012 of 121 was driven by increased tonnage and pricing tonnage increased 75 primarily due to a 70 increase in shipments and a 05 increase in weight per shipment for the periods compared we believe the increase in shipments during the year was primarily due to increased market share as our growth exceeded reported industry levels 

revenue per hundredweight increased 44 to 1553 in 2012 this increase reflects our disciplined yield management process as well as an improved pricing environment in 2012 revenue per hundredweight is a good indicator of pricing trends but this metric is influenced by many other factors such as changes in fuel surcharges weight per shipment length of haul and mix of freight therefore changes in revenue per hundredweight do not necessarily indicate actual changes in underlying rates our revenue per hundredweight excluding fuel surcharges increased 40 in 2012 despite the negative influence of the increase in weight per shipment and decrease in length of haul 

fuel surcharge revenue increased to 165 of revenue in 2012 from 162 in 2011 primarily due to a slight increase in the average price per gallon for diesel fuel most of our tariffs and contracts provide for a fuel surcharge which is recorded as additional revenue as diesel fuel prices increase above stated levels these levels are generally indexed to the doe’s published fuel prices that reset each week the fuel surcharge is one of many components included in the overall negotiated price for our transportation services with our customers although it is generally considered to be a measure of the increase in cost of all petroleum products we use we regularly monitor the components of our pricing including base freight rates and fuel surcharges we also address any individual account profitability issues with our customers as part of our effort to minimize the negative impact on our profitability that would likely result from a rapid and significant change in any of our operating expenses 

operating costs and other expenses 

salaries wages and benefits increased 1105 million or 116 in 2012 due to a 728 million increase in the costs for salaries and wages and a 377 million increase in benefit costs the increase in the costs for our salaries and wages excluding benefits was due primarily to a 69 increase in average fulltime employees over 2011 and the impact of wage increases provided to employees in september 2011 and 2012 the increase in our headcount was necessary to ensure adequate labor capacity for the increase in shipments during 2012 as well as for projected growth as a result our direct labor costs for drivers platform employees and fleet technicians increased 552 million or 108 in 2012 as compared to 2011 although these costs increased during 2012 our salaries and wages as a percent of revenue improved to 374 from 381 in 2011 as a result of the increased density and efficiency in our operations our platform pounds handled per hour pd stops per hour and pd shipments per hour improved 40 07 and 05 respectively over the prioryear period 

employee benefit costs increased 377 million primarily due to an increase in the number of fulltime employees eligible for benefits an increase in paid time off for employees and an increase in the cost per employee for our group health and dental plans as a percentage of salaries and wages employee benefit costs increased to 337 in 2012 from 319 in 2011 

operating supplies and expenses increased 233 million in 2012 primarily due to the increases in the costs of diesel fuel excluding fuel taxes which represents the largest component of operating supplies and expenses diesel fuel costs can vary based on both consumption and average price per gallon both of which increased over 2011 gallons consumed and average price per gallon increased 51 and 24 respectively in 2012 as compared to 2011 although we saw increases in these costs operating supplies and expenses decreased as a percent of revenue to 177 in 2012 from 187 in 2011 we attribute this improvement primarily to certain operational initiatives and the increased use of newer more fuelefficient equipment during 2012 we do not use diesel fuel hedging instruments and are therefore subject to market price fluctuations 

depreciation and amortization expense increased to 52 of revenue in 2012 as compared to 48 in 2011 this increase was primarily due to the increase in our capital expenditure program for 2012 which included a significant increase in the number of tractors and trailers purchased in addition our unit costs for tractors have increased significantly due primarily to the impact of increasingly stringent emission standard requirements since 2002 the average cost of a new tractor in our fleet has increased approximately 45000 or 85 although our capital expenditure plan for 2013 was lower than 2012 we expect our continued growth and investments to increase depreciation costs in future periods 

our effective tax rate for 2012 was 380 as compared to 366 in 2011 our effective tax rate in 2011 was favorably impacted by tax credits related to our investment in alternative energyproducing assets and alternative fuel tax credits for the use of propane in our operations these alternative fuel tax credits expired on december 31 2011 however congress retroactively reinstated these credits for 2012 and extended the credits through december 31 2013 by passing the american taxpayer relief act of 2012 on january 1 2013 the impact of the retroactive application was recorded as a favorable discrete tax benefit during the first quarter of 2013 

liquidity and capital resources 

a summary of our cash flows is presented below 



the changes in our cash flows provided by operating activities for the periods presented above are due primarily to the significant improvement in our net income which increased 367 million in 2013 and 300 million in 2012 over the comparable prioryear periods these increases are more fully described above in “ results of operations ” depreciation and amortization expenses also increased 163 million in 2013 and 199 million in 2012 over the comparable prior year periods which was primarily due to the ongoing execution of our capital expenditure programs that is more fully described below  

other changes in our cash flows provided by operating activities are related to various fluctuations within our working capital accounts which primarily include changes in customer receivables and certain accrued liabilities 

the changes in our cash flows used in investing activities are primarily due to fluctuations in our capital expenditure programs each year the changes in our capital expenditure program are more fully described below in “ capital expenditures”   

the changes in our cash flows from financing activities consists primarily of fluctuations in our senior unsecured revolving line of credit and scheduled principal payments under our longterm debt agreements additionally in 2011 we completed a 950 million private placement of senior notes and we received aggregate net proceeds of 484 million resulting from the issuance of our common stock both of which are discussed in more detail below 

we have three primary sources of available liquidity cash and cash equivalents cash flows from operations and available borrowings under our senior unsecured revolving credit agreement which is described below we believe we also have sufficient access to debt and equity markets to provide other sources of liquidity if needed 

on january 3 2011 we entered into a note purchase agreement pursuant to which we issued 950 million of privatelyplaced senior notes we entered into this note purchase agreement to fund planned capital expenditures and for general corporate purposes we used a portion of the proceeds to refinance existing indebtedness including paying down the outstanding balance on our senior unsecured revolving credit agreement 

pursuant to an automatic shelf registration statement previously filed with the securities and exchange commission the “sec” we filed a prospectus supplement and entered into an atthemarket equity offering sales agreement on february 2 2011 with stifel nicolaus  company incorporated “stifel nicolaus weisel” under which we had the ability to issue and sell from time to time over a 12month period through or to stifel nicolaus weisel shares of our common stock having an aggregate offering price of up to 1000 million the “atm program” from february 2 2011 through december 31 2011 we issued 2274568 shares of common stock pursuant to the atm program at an average price of 2179 per share after adjusting for a threefortwo stock split effected on september 7 2012 we received aggregate gross proceeds of 496 million and aggregate net proceeds of 484 million after deducting commissions and other transaction costs of 12 million there were no subsequent issuances pursuant to the atm program through february 2 2012 which was the date on which the atm program expired our automatic shelf registration statement that provided us with the opportunity to offer and sell shares of common stock on a delayed or continuous basis at indeterminate prices expired in the fourth quarter of 2012 

capital expenditures 

the table below sets forth our net capital expenditures for property and equipment including those obtained through capital leases and nonmonetary exchanges for the years ended december 31 2013  2012  and 2011  



our capital expenditure requirements are generally based upon the projected increase in the number and size of our service center facilities to support our plan for longterm growth our planned tractor and trailer replacement cycle and forecasted tonnage growth expenditures for land and structures in 2013 and 2012 were significant due to the ongoing expansion of our service center network the purchase of service centers in locations that were previously under lease and improvements to our existing service centers our capital expenditures for tractors and trailers decreased slightly in 2013 as we spent a higher amount in 2012 to reduce the average age of our fleet we generally spend 6 to 8 of total revenue on tractors and trailers each year to support our projected tonnage growth as well as to replace equipment being retired through our normal replacement cycle we expect to continue to maintain a high level of capital expenditures in order to support our longterm plan for market share growth 

we currently estimate capital expenditures will be approximately 3420 million for the year ending december 31 2014 approximately 1320 million is allocated for the purchase of service center facilities construction of new service center facilities or expansion of existing service center facilities subject to the availability of suitable real estate and the timing of construction projects approximately 1630 million is allocated for the purchase of tractors trailers and other equipment and approximately 470 million is allocated for investments in technology and other assets we expect to fund these capital expenditures primarily through cash flows from operations our existing cash and cash equivalents and the use of our senior unsecured revolving credit facility if needed we believe our current sources of liquidity will be sufficient to satisfy our expected capital expenditures 

we anticipate that there will be additional environmental regulations and legislation resulting from the increased regulatory focus on climate change and greenhouse gas emissions in the united states at this time we cannot predict the requirements of any future regulations however any limitations on the emission of greenhouse gases or other environmental legislation could increase our future capital expenditures and have an adverse impact on our financial condition results of operations and liquidity 

financing agreements 

we have a fiveyear 2000 million senior unsecured revolving credit facility pursuant to the terms of a second amended and restated credit agreement dated august 10 2011 the “credit agreement” with wells fargo bank national association “wells fargo” serving as administrative agent for the lenders of the 2000 million line of credit commitments 1500 million may be used for letters of credit and 200 million may be used for borrowings under the wells fargo sweep plus loan program we utilize the sweep program to manage our daily cash needs as the sweep program automatically initiates borrowings to cover overnight cash requirements up to an aggregate of 200 million in addition we have the right to request an increase in the line of credit commitments up to a total of 3000 million in minimum increments of 250 million 

at our option revolving loans under the facility bear interest at either a the applicable margin percentage for base rate loans plus the higher of wells fargo’s prime rate the federal funds rate plus 05 per annum or the one month libor rate plus 10 per annum b the libor rate plus the applicable margin percentage for libor loans or c the libor market index rate “libor index rate” plus the applicable margin percentage for libor market index loans the applicable margin percentage is determined by a pricing grid in the credit agreement and ranges from 10  to 1875  based upon the ratio of debt to total capitalization the applicable margin percentage was 10  and 1125  at december 31 2013  and 2012  respectively and ranged from 10  to 1125  during 2013  revolving loans under the sweep program bear interest at the libor index rate 

the credit agreement contains customary covenants including financial covenants that require us to observe a maximum ratio of debt to total capital and a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio any future whollyowned subsidiaries of old dominion would be required to guarantee payment of all of our obligations under the facility the amounts outstanding and remaining borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facilities are presented below 



commitment fees ranging from 0175  to 030  are charged quarterly in arrears on the aggregate unutilized portion of the credit agreement based upon the ratio of debt to total capitalization letter of credit fees equal to the applicable margin for adjusted libor rate loans are charged quarterly in arrears on the daily average aggregate stated amount of all letters of credit outstanding during the quarter the commitment fees ranged from 0175  to 020  and letter of credit fees ranged from 10  to 1125  during 2013  in addition the company will pay to wells fargo as issuer of letters of credit i a facing fee with respect to each letter of credit in an amount equal to 0125  of the daily average aggregate stated amount thereof payable quarterly in arrears and calculated on an actual360day basis and ii such fees and charges customarily charged in connection with the issuance and administration of such letters of credit wells fargo as administrative agent also receives an annual administrative fee for providing such services 

we have three outstanding unsecured senior note agreements with an aggregate amount outstanding of 1914 million  at december 31 2013  these notes call for periodic principal payments with maturities that range from 2015 to 2021 of which 

357 million  is due in the next twelve months interest rates on these notes are fixed and range from 400 to 585 the effective average interest rate on our outstanding senior note agreements was 499  and 507  at december 31 2013  and 2012  respectively 

with the exception of borrowings pursuant to the credit agreement interest rates are fixed on all of our debt instruments therefore shortterm exposure to fluctuations in interest rates is limited to our line of credit facility we do not currently use interest rate derivative instruments to manage exposure to interest rate changes 

our credit agreement limits the amount of dividends that could be paid to shareholders to the greater of i 200 million ii the amount of dividends paid in the immediately preceding fiscal year or iii an amount equal to 25 of net income from the immediately preceding fiscal year we did not declare or pay a dividend on our common stock in 2013  or 2012  and we have no plans to declare or pay a dividend in 2014  

a significant decrease in demand for our services could limit our ability to generate cash flow and affect profitability most of our debt agreements have covenants that require stated levels of financial performance which if not achieved could cause acceleration of the payment schedules as of december 31 2013  we were in compliance with these covenants we do not anticipate a significant decline in business levels or financial performance that would cause us to violate any such covenants in the future and we believe the combination of our existing credit agreement along with our additional borrowing capacity will be sufficient to meet foreseeable seasonal and longterm capital needs 

common stock split 

on august 13 2012 we announced a threefortwo common stock split for shareholders of record as of the close of business on the record date august 24 2012 on september 7 2012 those shareholders received one additional share of common stock for every two shares owned in lieu of fractional shares shareholders received a cash payment based on the average of the high and low sales prices of our common stock on the record date 

all references in this report to shares outstanding weighted average shares outstanding and earnings per share amounts have been restated retroactively to reflect this stock split 

contractual obligations 

the following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations as of december 31 2013  



  

 

critical accounting policies 

in preparing our financial statements we apply the following critical accounting policies that we believe affect our judgments and estimates of amounts recorded in certain assets liabilities revenue and expenses these critical accounting policies are further described in note 1 of the notes to the financial statements included in item 8 of this report 

revenue recognition 

we recognize revenue based upon when our transportation services have been completed in accordance with the bill of lading contract our general tariff provisions or contractual agreements with our customers generally this occurs when we complete the delivery of a shipment for transportation services not completed at the end of a reporting period we use a percentage of completion method to allocate the appropriate revenue to each separate reporting period under this method we develop a factor for each uncompleted shipment by dividing the actual number of days in transit at the end of a reporting period by that shipment’s standard delivery time schedule this factor is applied to the total revenue for that shipment and revenue is allocated between reporting periods accordingly 

allowances for uncollectible accounts and revenue adjustments 

we maintain an allowance for uncollectible accounts for estimated losses resulting from the failure of our customers to make required payments we estimate this allowance by analyzing the aging of our customer receivables our historical loss experience and other trends and factors affecting the credit risk of our customers we determine customer receivables to be past due when payment has not been received by the invoice due date writeoffs occur when we determine an account to be uncollectible and could differ from our allowance estimate as a result of factors such as changes in the overall economic environment or risks surrounding our customers additional allowances may be required if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments we periodically review the underlying assumptions in our estimate of the allowance for uncollectible accounts to ensure that the allowance reflects the most recent trends and factors 

we also maintain an allowance for estimated revenue adjustments resulting from future billing corrections customer allowances moneyback service guarantees and other miscellaneous revenue adjustments these revenue adjustments are recorded in our revenue from operations we use historical experience trends and current information to update and evaluate these estimates 

claims and insurance accruals 

claims and insurance accruals reflect the estimated cost of claims not covered by insurance for cargo loss and damage bipd workers’ compensation longterm disability group health and dental the related costs are charged to insurance and claims expense except for workers’ compensation longterm disability group health and dental which are charged to employee benefits expense 

insurers providing excess coverage above retention levels adjust their premiums to cover insured losses and for other market factors as a result we periodically evaluate our selfinsured retention levels to determine the most costefficient balance between our retention exposure and excess coverage 

in establishing accruals for claims and expenses we evaluate and monitor each claim individually and we use factors such as historical claims development experience known trends and thirdparty estimates to determine the appropriate reserves for potential liability we believe the assumptions and methods used to estimate these liabilities are reasonable however any changes in the severity of previouslyreported claims significant changes in medical costs and regulatory changes affecting the administration of our plans could significantly impact the determination of appropriate reserves in future periods 

property and equipment 

property and equipment are recorded at cost and depreciated on a straightline basis over their estimated economic lives we use historical experience certain assumptions and estimates in determining the economic life of each asset periodically we review property and equipment for impairment due to changes in operational and market conditions and we adjust the carrying value and economic life of any impaired asset as appropriate 

estimated economic lives for structures are 7 to 30 years revenue equipment is 4 to 15 years other equipment is 2 to 20 years and leasehold improvements are the lesser of the economic life of the leasehold improvement or the remaining life of the lease the use of different assumptions estimates or significant changes in the resale market for our equipment could result in material changes in the carrying value and related depreciation of our assets 

inflation 

most of our expenses are affected by inflation which typically results in increased operating costs in response to fluctuations in the cost of petroleum products particularly diesel fuel we generally include a fuel surcharge in our tariffs and contractual agreements the fuel surcharge is designed to offset the cost of diesel fuel above a base price and increases as diesel fuel prices escalate over the base which is generally indexed to the doe’s published fuel prices that reset each week volatility in the price of diesel fuel independent of inflation has impacted our business as described in this report however we do not believe inflation has had a material effect on our results of operations for each of the past three years 

related person transactions 

family relationships 

each of earl e congdon david s congdon and john r congdon jr are related to one another and served in various management positions andor on our board of directors during 2013 we have employment agreements with earl e congdon and david s congdon which are incorporated by reference as exhibits to our annual report on form 10k we regularly disclose the amount of compensation that we pay to these individuals as well as any of their family members employed by us and whose compensation from time to time may require disclosure in the proxy statement for our annual meeting of shareholders 

during 2012 john r congdon who was the brother of earl e congdon resigned from his position as senior vice president at that time the board of directors and john r congdon mutually agreed to terminate his amended and restated employment agreement he continued to be employed by the company in a management position and as a member of our board of directors until his death in october 2013 

transactions with old dominion truck leasing inc 

old dominion truck leasing inc “leasing” is a north carolina corporation whose voting stock is beneficially owned by members of the congdon family leasing is primarily engaged in the business of leasing tractors trailers and other vehicles as well as providing contract dedicated fleet services john r congdon served as chairman of the board of leasing until october 2013 and was succeeded in that position by john r congdon jr earl e congdon and david s congdon currently serve as members of leasing’s board of directors since 1986 we have combined our requirements with leasing for the purchase of tractors trailers equipment parts tires and fuel we believe that the termination of this arrangement would not have a material adverse impact on our financial results 

we purchased 299000  239000  and 278000  of maintenance and other services from leasing in 2013  2012  and 2011  respectively we intend to continue to purchase maintenance and other services from leasing provided that leasing’s prices continue to be favorable to us 

we charged leasing 18000  18000  and 18000  for the rental of property in 2013  2012  and 2011  respectively no other services were provided to leasing for the years ended december 31 2013  2012  and 2011  

splitdollar life insurance policies 

we owned two splitdollar life insurance contracts insuring the life of john r congdon that were terminated upon mr congdons death in october 2013 the death benefits under these policies totaled an aggregate of 93 million  of which we received 73 million  in december 2013 and mr congdon’s beneficiaries received 20 million  at december 31 2012  the net cash surrender value for these policies totaled 68 million  and was included on our balance sheet under the caption of “other assets” 

audit committee approval 

the audit committee of our board of directors reviewed and approved all of the related person transactions described above in accordance with our related person transactions policy 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact our financial position results of operations and cash flows due to adverse changes in financial market prices and rates 

we are exposed to interest rate risk directly related to loans if any under our credit agreement which have variable interest rates a 100 basis point increase in the average interest rate on this agreement would have no material effect on our operating results we have established policies and procedures to manage exposure to market risks and use major institutions that we believe are creditworthy to minimize credit risk 

we are exposed to market risk for equity investments relating to companyowned life insurance contracts on certain employees at december 31 2013  the cash value for variable life insurance contracts was 294 million of the 316 million of aggregate cash values for all life insurance contracts included on our balance sheets variable life insurance contracts expose us to fluctuations in equity markets however we utilize a thirdparty to manage these assets and minimize that exposure a 10 change in market value in those investments would have a 29 million impact on our pretax income 

we are exposed to market risk for awards granted under our employee and director phantom stock plans the liability for the unsettled outstanding awards is remeasured at the end of each reporting period based on the closing price of our common stock at that date at december 31 2013  the total liability for awards granted under our employee and director phantom stock plans totaled 236 million a 10 change in the price of our common stock at december 31 2013  would have had a 24 million impact on our operating income in 2013  with respect to these plans 

we are also exposed to commodity price risk related to diesel fuel prices and manage our exposure to that risk primarily through the application of fuel surcharges to our customers 

for further discussion related to these risks see notes 2 and 8 to the financial statements included in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” and item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations”

overview 

we are a leading lessthantruckload “ltl” unionfree motor carrier providing regional interregional and national ltl service and other valueadded services from a single integrated organization we are the sixth largest ltl motor carrier in the united states as measured by 2011 revenue according to transport topics  in addition to our core ltl services we offer our customers a broad range of valueadded services including ground and air expedited transportation container delivery truckload brokerage supply chain consulting warehousing and consumer household pickup and delivery services we also offer worldwide freight forwarding services our services are complemented by our technological capabilities which we believe provide the tools to improve the efficiency of our operations while empowering our customers to manage their shipping needs more than 90 of our revenue is derived from transporting ltl shipments for our customers whose demand for our services is generally tied to industrial production and the overall health of the us domestic economy 

we have increased our revenue and customer base through both organic growth and strategic acquisitions and provide our domestic ltl services throughout the entire continental united states our infrastructure allows us to provide nextday and secondday service within each of our six regions as well as interregional and national service between these regions to support our ongoing expansion we added 26 new service centers in the past five years for a total of 218 at december 31 2012  

we believe our growth can be attributed to our focus on meeting our customers’ complete supply chain needs from a single point of contact while providing a high level of customer service at a fair and equitable price our service is supported by ongoing investment in our employees service center network and technology our integrated structure allows us to offer our customers consistent highquality service from origin to destination and we believe our operating structure and proprietary information systems also enable us to efficiently manage our operating costs 

we were founded in 1934 and incorporated in virginia in 1950 our principal executive offices are located at 500 old dominion way thomasville north carolina 27360 please refer to the balance sheets and statements of operations included in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” of this report for information regarding our total assets revenue from operations and net income 

our industry 

trucking companies provide transportation services to virtually every industry operating in the united states and generally offer higher levels of reliability and faster transit times than other surface transportation options the trucking industry is comprised principally of two types of motor carriers ltl and truckload ltl carriers typically pick up multiple shipments from multiple customers on a single truck and then route that freight for delivery through service centers where the freight may be transferred to other trucks with similar destinations in contrast truckload carriers generally dedicate an entire trailer to one customer from origin to destination 

according to the american trucking associations total us freight transportation revenue in 2011 was 7462 billion of which the trucking industry accounted for 809 the ltl sector had revenue in 2011 of 469 billion which represented 63 of total us freight transportation revenue in contrast to truckload carriers ltl motor carriers require expansive networks of local pickup and delivery “pd” service centers as well as larger breakbulk or hub facilities significant capital is required to create and maintain a network of service centers and a fleet of tractors and trailers the high fixed costs and capital spending requirements for ltl motor carriers makes it difficult for new startup or small operators to effectively compete with established companies in addition successful ltl motor carriers generally employ and regularly update a high level of technologybased systems and processes that provide information to customers and reduce operating costs 

the ltl industry is highly competitive on the basis of service and price and has consolidated significantly since the industry was deregulated in 1980 based on 2011 revenue as reported in transport topics  the top 25 ltl motor carriers accounted for approximately 64 of the total ltl market we believe consolidation in our industry will continue due to customer demand for single transportation providers offering both national and regional ltl service and complex supply chain services smaller regional carriers with lesser financial resources are generally unable to meet this demand 

competition 

we compete with regional interregional and national ltl carriers and to a lesser extent with truckload carriers small package carriers airfreight carriers and railroads we also compete with and provide transportation services to thirdparty logistics providers that determine both the mode of transportation and the carrier competition is based primarily on service price and business relationships we believe we are able to compete effectively in our markets by providing highquality and timely service at fair and equitable prices 

at all levels of our organization we seek to continuously improve customer service by maximizing ontime performance while reducing transit times and minimizing cargo claims we believe our transit times are generally faster than those of our principal national competitors in part because of our more efficient service center network use of team drivers and proprietary technology in addition we provide greater geographic coverage than most of our regional competitors our diversified mix and scope of regional interregional and national service combined with our valueadded service offerings enables us to provide our customers with a single source to meet their shipping and logistics needs we believe this provides us with a distinct advantage over most of our regional multiregional and national competition 

we utilize flexible scheduling and train our unionfree employees to perform multiple tasks which we believe allows us to achieve greater productivity and higher levels of customer service than our competitors we believe our focus on employee communication continued education development and motivation strengthens the relationships and trust among our employees 

we compete with several large and more diversified transportation service providers each of which may have more equipment a broader global network and a wider range of services than we have our larger competitors may also have greater financial resources and in general the ability to reduce prices to gain business especially during times of reduced growth rates in the economy 

service center operations 

at december 31 2012  we conducted operations through 218  service center locations of which we owned 150  and leased 68  we operate ten major breakbulk facilities in rialto california atlanta georgia chicago illinois indianapolis indiana greensboro north carolina harrisburg pennsylvania memphis and morristown tennessee dallas texas and salt lake city utah while using other service centers for limited breakbulk activity in order to serve our nextday markets our service centers are strategically located in six regions of the country to provide the highest quality service and minimize freight rehandling costs 

our service centers are responsible for the pickup and delivery of freight within their service area each night our service centers load outbound freight for transport to other service centers for delivery all inbound freight received by the service center in the evening or during the night is scheduled for local delivery the next business day unless a customer requests a different delivery schedule our management reviews the productivity and service performance of each service center on a daily basis to help ensure quality service and efficient operations 

while we have established primary responsibility for customer service at the local service center level our customers may access information and initiate transactions through our centralized customer service department located at our corporate office or through several other gateways such as our website electronic data interchange “edi” email and fax notification systems and automated voice response systems our systems offer direct access to information such as freight tracking shipping documents rate quotes rate databases and account activity these centralized systems and our customer service department provide our customers with a single point of contact to access information across all areas of our operations and for each of our service products 

linehaul transportation 

linehaul dispatchers control the movement of freight between service centers through integrated freight movement systems we also utilize loadplanning software to optimize efficiencies in our linehaul operations our senior management monitors freight movements transit times load factors and many other productivity measurements to ensure that we maintain our highest levels of service and efficiency 

we utilize scheduled routes and additional linehaul dispatches as necessary to meet our published transit times in addition we lower our cost structure by maintaining flexible workforce rules and by primarily using twin 28foot trailers in our linehaul operations the use of twin 28foot trailers permits us to transport freight directly from its point of origin to destination with minimal unloading and reloading which also reduces cargo loss and damage expenses we utilize longcombination vehicles such as triple 28foot trailers and combinations of 48foot and 28foot trailers in states where permitted twin trailers and longcombination vehicles permit more freight to be hauled behind a tractor than could otherwise be hauled by one large trailer 

tractors trailers and maintenance 

at december 31 2012  we owned 6099  tractors we generally use new tractors in linehaul operations for approximately three to five years and then transfer those tractors to pd operations for the remainder of their useful lives in many of our service centers tractors perform pd functions during the day and linehaul functions at night to maximize tractor utilization 

at december 31 2012  we owned 24181 trailers we primarily purchase new trailers for our operations however we occasionally purchase preowned equipment that meets our specifications the purchase of preowned equipment can provide an excellent value but also can increase our fleet’s average age the table below reflects as of december 31 2012  the average age of our tractors and trailers 



we develop certain specifications for tractors and trailers and then negotiate the production and purchase of this equipment with several manufacturers these purchases are planned well in advance of anticipated delivery dates in order to accommodate manufacturers’ production schedules we believe there is sufficient capacity among suppliers to ensure an uninterrupted supply of equipment to support our operations 

the table below sets forth our capital expenditures for tractors and trailers for the years ended december 31 2012  2011  and 2010  for more information concerning our capital expenditures see item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations – liquidity and capital resources ” of this report 



at december 31 2012  we had major maintenance operations at our service centers in rialto california denver colorado atlanta georgia indianapolis indiana kansas city and parsons kansas greensboro north carolina columbus ohio harrisburg pennsylvania morristown and memphis tennessee dallas texas and salt lake city utah in addition 22 other service center locations are equipped to perform routine and preventive maintenance and repairs on our equipment 

we adhere to established maintenance policies and procedures to help ensure our fleet is properly maintained tractors are routed to appropriate maintenance facilities at designated mileage intervals or 90 days whichever occurs first trailers are scheduled for maintenance every 90 days 

customers 

revenue is generated by customers dispersed primarily throughout the united states and north america in 2012  our largest customer accounted for approximately 26 of our revenue and our largest 5 10 and 20 customers accounted for approximately 89 140 and 211 of our revenue respectively for each of the previous three years more than 90 of our revenue was derived from transporting ltl shipments for our customers and less than 5 of our revenue was generated from international services we believe the diversity of our customer base helps protect our business from adverse developments in a single geographic region and from the reduction or loss of business from a single customer 

we utilize an integrated freightcosting system to determine the price level at which a particular shipment of freight will be profitable we can modify elements of this freightcosting model to simulate the actual conditions under which the freight will be moved many of our customers engage our services through the terms and provisions of our tariffs we also compete for business by participating in bid solicitations customers generally solicit bids for relatively large numbers of shipments for a period of one to two years and typically choose to enter into contractual arrangements with a limited number of motor carriers based upon price and service 

seasonality 

our operations are subject to seasonal trends common in the trucking industry our operating margins in the first quarter are normally lower due to reduced demand during the winter months harsh weather can also adversely affect our performance by reducing demand and reducing our ability to transport freight which could result in decreased revenue and increased operating expenses 

technology 

we continually upgrade and enhance our technological capabilities and we provide access to our systems through multiple gateways that offer our customers maximum flexibility and immediate access to information we employ vehicle safety systems onboard and handheld computer systems freight handling systems and logistics technology to reduce costs and transit times we continue to focus on the development and enhancement of the technology used in our operations in order to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of our services 

insurance 

we carry a significant amount of insurance with thirdparty insurance carriers but we are exposed to the risk of loss on claims up to the limit for which we hold either a selfinsured retention sir or deductible at december 31 2012 we maintained an sir of 275 million per occurrence for bodily injury and property damage “bipd” claims a deductible of 100000 per claim for cargo loss and damage a deductible of 10 million per occurrence for workers’ compensation claims and an sir of 400000 per occurrence with a 200000 aggregate over our retention level for group health claims 

we believe that our policy of maintaining an sir or deductible for a portion of our risks supported by our safety and loss prevention programs is an effective means of managing insurance costs we periodically review our risks and insurance coverage applicable to those risks and we believe that our current insurance coverage is sufficient 

diesel fuel availability and cost 

our industry depends heavily upon the availability of diesel fuel although we currently maintain fuel storage and pumping facilities at 50 or 23 of our service center locations we may be susceptible to fuel shortages at certain locations that could cause us to incur additional expense to help ensure adequate supply on a timely basis to prevent a disruption to our service schedules 

diesel fuel costs including fuel taxes totaled 144 150 and 131 of revenue in 2012  2011  and 2010  respectively we believe our operations and financial condition are susceptible to the same diesel fuel price increases or shortages as those of our competitors we implemented a fuel surcharge program in august 1999 which has remained in effect since that time and is one of many components that we use to determine the overall price for our transportation services our fuel surcharges are generally indexed to fuel prices published by the us department of energy the “doe” that reset each week 

employees 

as of december 31 2012  we employed 13016  individuals on a fulltime basis none of which were represented under a collective bargaining agreement our fulltime employees work in the following roles 



as of december 31 2012  we employed 3484 linehaul drivers and 3456 pd drivers on a fulltime basis we select our drivers primarily based upon safe driving records and experience among other requirements our drivers must pass a drug test have a current us department of transportation “dot” physical and have a valid commercial driver’s license prior to employment once employed drivers are required to obtain and maintain hazardous materials endorsements to their commercial driver’s licenses drivers as well as all employees are required to take preemployment drug and alcohol tests and are randomly selected for periodic additional testing 

to help fulfill driver needs we offer qualified employees the opportunity to become drivers through the “old dominion driver training program” since its inception in 1988 through december 31 2012  3297 individuals have graduated from this program of the program graduates we have experienced an annual turnover rate of approximately 61 which is below our companywide average turnover rate of approximately 116 for drivers we believe our driver training and qualification programs have been important factors in improving our safety record and retaining qualified drivers drivers with safe driving records are rewarded with bonuses of up to 3000 payable each year driver safety bonuses paid during 2012  and 2011  were 26 million and 23 million respectively 

at december 31 2012  we had a sales staff of 513  employees we compensate our sales force in part based upon certain operating metrics to help motivate our sales employees to achieve our service growth and profitability objectives 

governmental regulation 

we are subject to regulation by many federal governmental agencies including the federal motor carrier safety administration the “fmcsa” the pipeline and hazardous materials safety agency and the surface transportation board which are agencies within the dot we are also subject to rules and regulations of various state agencies these regulatory authorities have broad powers generally governing matters such as authority to engage in motor carrier operations motor carrier registration driver hours of service safety and fitness of transportation equipment and drivers certain mergers consolidations and acquisitions and periodic financial reporting in addition we are subject to compliance with cargosecurity 

and transportation regulations issued by the transportation security administration within the us department of homeland security 

in october 2009 the us court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit ordered the fmcsa to review and reissue rules governing hours of service for commercial truck drivers by july 26 2011 this deadline was extended and on december 22 2011 the fmcsa issued its final rule which requires compliance by july 1 2013 the final rule reduces the maximum number of hours a truck driver can work each week to 70 hours from the current 82hour limit the rule maintains the current maximum 11hour daily driving limit but requires drivers to take a 30minute break prior to driving beyond eight hours the rule also includes a “34hour restart” provision that allows drivers to restart the clock on their work week by taking at least 34 consecutive hours offduty provided these 34 offduty hours includes two periods between 100 am and 500 am and occurs only once during a sevenday period we do not believe this new rule when implemented will have a significant impact on our operating procedures and will not significantly impact our costs we are however subject to future rulemaking by the fmcsa and other regulatory agencies which could be more stringent require changes to our operations increase our operating costs or otherwise adversely impact our results of operations 

the trucking industry is subject to regulatory and legislative changes from a variety of other governmental authorities which address matters such as i increasingly stringent environmental and occupational safety and health regulations ii limits on vehicle weight and size iii ergonomics iv port security and v hours of service these changes may affect our business or the economics of our industry by requiring changes in operating practices or by influencing the demand for and increasing the costs of providing our services 

environmental regulation 

we are subject to various federal state and local environmental laws and regulations that focus on among other things the emission and discharge of hazardous materials into the environment or their presence at our properties or in our vehicles fuel storage tanks transportation of certain materials and the discharge or retention of storm water under specific environmental laws we could also be held responsible for any costs relating to contamination at our past or present facilities and at thirdparty waste disposal sites as well as costs associated with cleanup of accidents involving our vehicles we do not believe that the cost of future compliance with current environmental laws or regulations will have a material adverse effect on our operations financial condition competitive position or capital expenditures for the remainder of 2013 however future changes to laws or regulations may adversely affect our operations and could result in unforeseen costs to our business

 item 1a risk factors 

various factors exist that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those projected in any forwardlooking statement in addition to the factors discussed elsewhere in this report we believe the following are some of the important risks and uncertainties that could materially affect our business financial condition or results of operations 

we operate in a highly competitive industry and our business will suffer if we are unable to adequately address potential downward pricing pressures and other factors that may adversely affect our operations and profitability 

numerous competitive factors could impair our ability to maintain our current profitability these factors include but are not limited to the following 

 9 

 

if we are unable to effectively compete with other ltl carriers whether on the basis of price service or otherwise we may be unable to retain existing customers or attract new customers either of which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

if our employees were to unionize our operating costs would increase and our ability to compete would be impaired 

none of our employees are currently represented under a collective bargaining agreement however from time to time there have been efforts to organize our employees at various service centers further congress or one or more states could approve legislation andor the national labor relations board could render decisions that could significantly affect our business and our relationship with our employees including actions that could substantially liberalize the procedures for union organization in addition we can offer no assurance that the department of labor will not adopt new regulations or interpret existing regulations in a manner that would favor the agenda of unions or that our employees will not unionize in the future particularly if regulatory changes occur that facilitate unionization 

the unionization of our employees could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations because 

 

if we are unable to successfully execute our growth strategy our business and future results of operations may suffer 

our growth strategy includes increasing the volume of freight moving through our existing service center network selectively expanding our geographic footprint and broadening the scope of our service offerings in connection with our growth strategy at various times we have made selective acquisitions purchased additional equipment expanded and upgraded service centers and increased our sales and marketing efforts and we expect to continue to do so our growth strategy exposes us to a number of risks including the following 

 

we cannot assure that we will overcome the risks associated with our growth strategy if we fail to overcome those risks we may not realize additional revenue or profits from our efforts we may incur additional expenses and therefore our financial position and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 

we may be unable to successfully consummate and integrate acquisitions as part of our growth strategy 

growth through acquisitions has been a key component of our ltl growth strategy throughout our history in the future we may seek to acquire other ltl carriers as well as other complementary businesses exploration of potential acquisitions requires significant attention from our senior management team in addition we expect to compete for acquisition opportunities with other companies some of which may have greater financial and other resources than we do we cannot assure that we will 

have sufficient cash with which to consummate an acquisition or otherwise be able to obtain financing for any acquisition if we are unable to access sufficient funding for potential acquisitions we may not be able to complete transactions that we otherwise find advantageous 

any subsequent acquisition will entail numerous risks including 

 

in addition we may have difficulty integrating any acquired business and its operations services and personnel into our existing operations and such integration may require a significant amount of time and effort by our management team to the extent we do not successfully avoid or overcome the risks or problems resulting from any acquisitions we undertake there could be a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our customers’ and suppliers’ business may be impacted by a downturn in the economy andor a disruption of financial markets 

adverse economic conditions can negatively affect our customers’ business levels the amount of transportation services they need their ability to pay for our services and overall freight levels all of which might impair our asset utilization customers encountering adverse economic conditions may be unable to obtain additional financing or financing under acceptable terms due to disruptions in the capital and credit markets these customers represent a greater potential for bad debt losses which may require us to increase our reserve for bad debt economic conditions resulting in bankruptcies of one or more of our large customers could have a significant impact on our financial position results of operations or liquidity in a particular year or quarter further when adverse economic times arise customers may bid out freight or select competitors that offer lower rates in an attempt to lower their costs and we might be forced to lower our rates or lose freight 

our suppliers’ business levels also may be negatively affected by adverse economic conditions or financial constraints which could lead to disruptions in the supply and availability of equipment parts and services critical to our operations a significant interruption in our normal supply chain could disrupt our operations increase our costs and negatively impact our ability to serve our customers 

we also are subject to cost increases outside our control that could materially reduce our profitability if we are unable to increase our rates sufficiently such cost increases include but are not limited to increases in fuel prices driver wages interest rates taxes tolls license and registration fees insurance revenue equipment and healthcare for our employees 

increases in driver compensation or other difficulties attracting and retaining qualified drivers could adversely affect our profitability and ability to maintain or grow our fleet 

from time to time we have experienced difficulty in attracting and retaining sufficient numbers of qualified drivers and such shortages may recur in the future because of the intense competition for drivers we may face difficulty maintaining or increasing our number of drivers the compensation we offer our drivers is subject to market conditions that may require increases in driver compensation which becomes more likely as economic conditions improve if we are unable to attract and retain a sufficient number of drivers we could be required to adjust our compensation packages or operate with fewer trucks and face difficulty meeting shipper demands all of which could adversely affect our profitability and ability to maintain our size or grow 

insurance and claims expenses could significantly reduce our profitability 

we are exposed to claims related to cargo loss and damage property damage personal injury workers’ compensation group health and group dental we have insurance coverage with thirdparty insurance carriers but we assume a significant portion of the risk associated with these claims due to our selfinsured retentions and deductibles our operating results would be adversely affected if any of the following were to occur i the number or severity of claims increases ii we are required to accrue or pay additional amounts because the claims prove to be more severe than our original assessment or iii claims exceed our excess coverage amounts if claims exceed our retention or deductible levels or insurance market conditions change insurers could raise premiums for excess coverage to cover their expenses and anticipated future losses in addition insurance companies require us to obtain letters of credit to collateralize our retention or deductible levels if these requirements increase our borrowing capacity could be adversely affected 

recent healthcare legislation may increase our costs and reduce our future profitability 

to attract and retain employees we maintain a competitive health insurance plan for our employees and their dependents the patient protection and affordable care act signed into law in 2010 is expected to increase our annual employee healthcare costs going forward we cannot predict the extent that this legislation or any future state or federal healthcare legislation or regulation will have on us however rising healthcare costs and universal healthcare coverage in the united states could result in significant longterm costs to us which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results in addition rising healthcare costs could force us to make changes to our benefits program which could negatively impact our ability to attract and retain employees 

we have significant ongoing cash requirements that could limit our growth and affect our profitability if we are unable to obtain sufficient capital 

our business is highly capital intensive we generally finance our capital expenditures and planned growth with existing cash cash flow from operations issuance of debt and through available borrowings under our existing senior unsecured credit agreement we may require additional capital to finance longterm real estate purchase opportunities and acquisitions which we may fund through additional debt or through equity offerings if we are unable in the future to generate sufficient cash from our operations or raise capital by accessing the debt and equity markets we may be forced to limit our growth and operate our equipment for longer periods of time which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results 

our business also has significant ongoing operating cash requirements if our cash requirements are high or our cash flow from operations is low during particular periods we may need to seek additional financing which could be costly or difficult to obtain 

limited supply and increased prices for new equipment may adversely affect our earnings and cash flow 

we may face difficulty in purchasing new equipment due to decreased supply and increased costs investment in new equipment is a significant part of our annual capital expenditures and we require an available supply of tractors and trailers from equipment manufacturers to operate and grow our business we are also subject to shortages in raw materials that are required for the production of critical operating equipment and supplies such as shortages in rubber or steel 

the price of our equipment may also be adversely affected in the future by regulations on newly manufactured tractors and diesel engines we have incurred significant increases in the cost of tractors due to regulations of the us environmental protection agency the “epa” that require progressive reductions in exhaust emissions from diesel engines beginning in october 2002 new diesel engines were required to meet these new emission limits some of the regulations required reductions in the sulfur content of diesel fuel beginning in june 2006 and the introduction of emissions aftertreatment devices on newlymanufactured engines and vehicles beginning with modelyear 2007 the final phase of these regulations required reduced nitrogen and nonmethane hydrocarbon emissions beginning with modelyear 2010 beginning in 2013 these regulations also require that all heavyduty diesel engines built for highway applications over 14000 pounds include certified onboard diagnostics systems to monitor emissions these regulations have resulted in higher prices for tractors and diesel engines and increased operating and maintenance costs and there can be no assurance that continued increases in pricing or costs will not have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

we may be adversely impacted by fluctuations in the availability and price of diesel fuel 

diesel fuel is a critical component of our operations and a significant operating expense for our business diesel fuel prices and fuel availability can be impacted by factors beyond our control such as natural or manmade disasters political events price and supply decisions by oil producing countries and cartels terrorist activities armed conflict and world supply and demand imbalances we maintain fuel storage and pumping facilities at many of our service center locations however we may be susceptible to fuel shortages at certain locations that could cause us to incur additional expense to ensure adequate supply on a timely basis to prevent a disruption to our service schedules an interruption in the supply of diesel fuel could have a material adverse effect on our operating results 

we do not hedge against the risk of diesel fuel price increases an increase in diesel fuel prices or diesel fuel taxes or any change in federal or state regulations that results in such an increase could have a material adverse effect on our operating results we have fuel surcharge programs in place with a majority of our customers which have helped us offset the majority of the negative impact of the increased cost of diesel fuel and other petroleumbased products however we also incur fuel costs that cannot be recovered even with respect to customers with which we maintain fuel surcharge programs such as those costs associated with empty miles or the time when our engines are idling because our fuel surcharge recovery lags behind changes in fuel prices our fuel surcharge recovery may not capture the increased costs we pay for fuel especially when prices are rising leading to fluctuations in our levels of reimbursement we regularly monitor the components of our pricing including fuel surcharges and address individual account profitability issues with our customers when necessary however there can be no assurance that fuel surcharges can be maintained indefinitely or will be sufficiently effective in offsetting increases in diesel fuel prices 

we are subject to various environmental laws and regulations and costs of compliance with liabilities under or violations of existing or future environmental laws or regulations could adversely affect our business 

we are subject to various federal state and local environmental laws and regulations that govern among other things the emission and discharge of hazardous materials into the environment the presence of hazardous materials at our properties or in our vehicles fuel storage tanks the transportation of certain materials and the discharge or retention of storm water under certain environmental laws we could also be held responsible for any costs relating to contamination at our past or present facilities and at thirdparty waste disposal sites as well as costs associated with the cleanup of accidents involving our vehicles environmental laws have become and are expected to continue to be increasingly more stringent over time and there can be no assurance that our costs of complying with current or future environmental laws or liabilities arising under such laws will not have a material adverse effect on our business operations or financial condition 

in addition to the epa regulations on exhaust emissions with which we must comply there is an increased regulatory focus on climate change and greenhouse gas emissions in the united states as a result we may become subject to additional 

legislation or rulemaking that could adversely impact our business any future limitations on the emission of greenhouse gases or other environmental legislation could increase our future capital expenditures and have an adverse impact on our financial condition results of operations and liquidity 

we are subject to the risks of litigation and governmental proceedings which could adversely affect our business 

we are and in the future may be subject to legal and governmental proceedings and claims the parties in such legal actions may seek amounts from us that may not be covered in whole or in part by insurance defending ourselves against such legal actions could result in significant costs and could require a substantial amount of time and effort by our management team we cannot predict the outcome of litigation or governmental proceedings to which we are a party or whether we will be subject to future legal actions as a result the potential costs associated with legal actions against us could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we operate in a highly regulated industry and increased costs of compliance with or liability for violation of existing or future regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business 

we are regulated by the dot and by various state agencies these regulatory authorities have broad powers generally governing matters such as authority to engage in motor carrier operations as well as motor carrier registration driver hours of service safety and fitness of transportation equipment and drivers transportation of hazardous materials certain mergers and acquisitions and periodic financial reporting in addition the trucking industry is subject to regulatory and legislative changes from a variety of other governmental authorities which address matters such as i increasingly stringent environmental occupational safety and health regulations ii limits on vehicle weight and size iii ergonomics iv port security and v hours of service in addition we are subject to compliance with cargosecurity and transportation regulations issued by the transportation security administration within the us department of homeland security regulatory requirements and changes in regulatory requirements may affect our business or the economics of the industry by requiring changes in operating practices or by influencing the demand for and increasing the costs of providing transportation services 

in october 2009 the us court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit ordered the fmcsa to review and reissue rules governing hours of service for commercial truck drivers by july 26 2011 this deadline was extended and on december 22 2011 the fmcsa issued its final rule which requires compliance by july 1 2013 the final rule reduces the maximum number of hours a truck driver can work each week to 70 hours from the current 82hour limit the rule maintains the current maximum 11hour daily driving limit but requires drivers to take a 30minute break prior to driving beyond eight hours the rule also includes a “34hour restart” provision that allows drivers to restart the clock on their work week by taking at least 34 consecutive hours offduty provided these 34 offduty hours includes two periods between 100 am and 500 am and occurs only once during a sevenday period we do not believe this new rule when implemented will have a significant impact on our operating procedures and will not significantly impact our costs we are however subject to future rulemaking by the fmcsa and other regulatory agencies which could be more stringent require changes to our operations increase our operating costs or otherwise adversely impact our results of operations 

the fmcsa’s compliance safety accountability initiative “csa” could adversely impact our ability to hire qualified drivers meet our growth projections and maintain our customer relationships each of which could adversely impact our results of operations 

the csa includes compliance and enforcement initiatives designed to monitor and improve commercial motor vehicle safety by measuring the safety record of both the motor carrier and the driver these measurements are scored and used by the fmcsa to identify potential safety risks and to direct enforcement action csa scores for transportation companies are currently available on the fmcsa’s website 

our csa scores are dependent upon our safety and compliance experience which could change at any time in addition the safety standards prescribed in csa could change and our ability to maintain an acceptable score could be adversely impacted if we receive an unacceptable csa score our relationships with our customers could be damaged which could result in a loss of business 

the requirements of csa could shrink the industry’s pool of drivers as those with unfavorable scores could leave the industry as a result the costs to attract train and retain qualified drivers could increase in addition a shortage of qualified drivers could increase driver turnover decrease asset utilization limit growth and adversely impact our results of operations 

our results of operations may be affected by seasonal factors and harsh weather conditions 

our operations are subject to seasonal trends common in the trucking industry our operating margins in the first quarter are normally lower due to reduced demand during the winter months harsh weather can also adversely affect our performance by reducing demand and reducing our ability to transport freight which could result in decreased revenue and increased operating expenses 

if we are unable to retain our key employees our financial condition results of operations and liquidity could be adversely affected 

our success will continue to depend upon the experience and leadership of our key employees and executive officers in that regard the loss of the services of any of our key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and liquidity 

our principal shareholders control a large portion of our outstanding common stock 

earl e congdon david s congdon john r congdon and members of their respective families beneficially own an aggregate of approximately 27 of the outstanding shares of our common stock as long as the congdon family controls a large portion of our voting stock they may be able to significantly influence the election of the entire board of directors and the outcome of all matters involving a shareholder vote the congdon family’s interests may differ from the interests of other shareholders and the status of their ownership could change at their discretion 

our financial results may be adversely impacted by potential future changes in accounting practices 

future changes in accounting standards or practices and related legal and regulatory interpretations of those changes may adversely impact public companies in general the transportation industry or our operations specifically new accounting standards or requirements such as a conversion from us generally accepted accounting principles to international financial reporting standards could change the way we record revenues expenses assets andor liabilities or could be costly to implement these types of regulations could have a negative impact on our financial position liquidity results of operations andor access to capital 

our information technology systems are subject to certain risks that we cannot control 

we are reliant on our information systems for our operations as well as providing a valueadded service to our customers our information systems including our accounting systems are dependent upon thirdparty software global communications providers data network systems and other aspects of technology and internet infrastructure that are susceptible to failure or an adverse cyber incident although we have implemented redundant systems and network security measures our information technology remains susceptible to interruptions caused by natural disasters outages computer viruses breakins and similar disruptions such an event could inhibit our ability to provide services to our customers and the ability of our customers to access our systems in addition there could be a loss of confidential information corruption of data and damage to our brand image this may result in a reduction in demand for our services or the loss of customers that could have a negative impact on our financial condition results of operations and liquidity 

misuse of social media outlets could damage our reputation and adversely affect our financial condition  

customers competitors employees and other individuals continue to increase the use of social media outlets and we maintain and manage our own corporate presence through various social media outlets we support new ways of sharing data and communicating through these social media outlets however information distributed via social networking could result in unfavorable publicity about us being disseminated quickly and broadly this unfavorable publicity could damage our reputation and may result in a reduction in demand for our services or the loss of customers that could have a negative impact on our financial condition results of operations and liquidity 

a decrease in the demand and value of used equipment may impact our results of operations 

as we purchase new tractors as part of our normal replacement cycle each year we rely on the used equipment market to dispose of our older equipment oversupply in the transportation industry as well as adverse domestic and foreign economic conditions can negatively impact the demand for used tractors and therefore reduce the value we can obtain on our used equipment if we are unable to sell our older equipment at or above salvage value the resulting losses could have a significant impact on our results of operations 

if we raise additional capital in the future your ownership in us could be diluted 

any issuance of equity we may undertake in the future to raise additional capital could cause the price of our common stock to decline or require us to issue shares at a price that is lower than that paid by holders of our common stock in the past which would result in those newly issued shares being dilutive if we obtain funds through a credit facility or through the issuance of debt or preferred securities these obligations and securities would likely have rights senior to your rights as a common shareholder which could impair the value of our common stock 

the market value of our common stock may fluctuate and could be substantially affected by various factors 

the price of our common stock on the nasdaq global select market constantly changes we expect that the market price of our common stock will continue to fluctuate as a result of a variety of factors many of which are beyond our control these factors include among others 

 

our common stock price may fluctuate significantly in the future and these fluctuations may be unrelated to our performance general market price declines or market volatility in the future could adversely affect the price of our common stock and the current market price of our common stock may not be indicative of future market prices 

our articles of incorporation our bylaws and virginia law contain provisions that could discourage delay or prevent a change in our control or our management 

provisions of our articles of incorporation bylaws and the laws of virginia the state in which we are incorporated may discourage delay or prevent a change in control of us or a change in management that shareholders may consider favorable these provisions 

 

these provisions could discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for you and other shareholders to take certain corporate actions these provisions could also limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock

we own our general office located in thomasville north carolina consisting of a twostory office building of approximately 160000 square feet on 301 acres of land at december 31 2012  we operated 218  service centers of which 150  were owned and 68  were leased our service centers that are owned include most of our larger facilities and account for 819 of the total door capacity in our network with the exception of our chicago illinois facility which has a lease that expires in 2021 we own our major breakbulk facilities each of our major breakbulk facilities is listed below with the number of doors as of december 31 2012  



our 218  facilities are strategically dispersed over the states in which we operate at december 31 2012  the terms of our leased properties ranged from monthtomonth to a lease that expires in 2023 we believe that as current leases expire we will be able to renew them or find comparable facilities without incurring any material negative impact on service to our customers or our operating results 

we also own 17 nonoperating properties all of which are held for lease or are planned for future use seven of these properties are leased with lease terms that range from monthtomonth to a lease that expires in 2017

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

overview 

we are a leading lessthantruckload “ltl” unionfree motor carrier providing regional interregional and national ltl service and other valueadded services from a single integrated organization in addition to our core ltl services we offer our customers a broad range of valueadded services including ground and air expedited transportation container delivery truckload brokerage supply chain consulting warehousing and consumer household pickup and delivery services we also offer worldwide freight forwarding services more than 90 of our revenue has historically been derived from transporting ltl shipments for our customers whose demand for our services is generally tied to industrial production and the overall health of the us domestic economy 

in analyzing the components of our revenue we monitor changes and trends in the following key metrics 

 

revenue per hundredweight is a commonlyused indicator of pricing trends but this metric can be influenced by many other factors such as changes in fuel surcharges weight per shipment length of haul and the mix of our freight as a result changes in revenue per hundredweight do not necessarily indicate actual changes in underlying base rates 

 

 

our primary revenue focus is to increase our “density” our shipment and tonnage growth within our existing infrastructure which allows us to maximize our asset utilization and labor productivity we measure density over many different functional areas of our operations including revenue per service center linehaul load factor pickup and delivery “pd” stops per hour pd shipments per hour platform pounds handled per hour and platform shipments per hour in addition to our focus on density it is critical for us to obtain an appropriate yield on the shipments we handle we manage our yields by focusing on individual account profitability we believe yield management and improvements in density are key components in our ability to produce profitable growth 

our primary cost elements are direct wages and benefits associated with the movement of freight fuel and equipment repair expenses and depreciation of our equipment fleet and service center facilities we gauge our overall success in managing these costs by monitoring our operating ratio a measure of profitability calculated by dividing total operating expenses by revenue which also allows industrywide comparisons with our competition 

we continually upgrade our technological capabilities to improve our customer service and lower our operating costs our technology provides our customers with visibility of their shipments throughout our network increases the productivity of our workforce and provides key metrics from which we can monitor our processes 

results of operations 

the following table sets forth for the years indicated expenses and other items as a percentage of revenue from operations 

  

  

   

2012  compared to 2011   

key financial and operating metrics for 2012  and 2011  are presented below 



our 2012 financial results were driven by strong growth in our revenue which exceeded 20 billion for the first time in our companys history in addition to our company record for annual revenue we also achieved company records for our annual operating ratio and earnings per diluted share we experienced strong growth in both tonnage and revenue per hundredweight while also improving the efficiency of our operations all of which led to margin improvement over the previous year as a result our operating ratio improved to 865 and net income increased 215 to 1695 million for 2012 

we believe our success in 2012 was primarily the result of our ability to win market share by providing shippers with a value proposition that consists of providing bestinclass ontime and claimsfree service at a fair and equitable price our commitment to this value proposition should allow us to continue to increase our tonnage and market share 

revenue 

our revenue growth during 2012 of 121 was driven by increases in tonnage and pricing tonnage increased 75 primarily due to a 70 increase in shipments and a 05 increase in weight per shipment for the periods compared we believe the increase in shipments during the year was primarily due to increased market share as our growth exceeded reported industry levels 

revenue per hundredweight increased 43 to 1535 in 2012 this increase reflects our disciplined yield management process as well as an improved pricing environment revenue per hundredweight is a good indicator of pricing trends but this metric is influenced by many other factors such as changes in fuel surcharges weight per shipment length of haul and mix of freight therefore changes in revenue per hundredweight do not necessarily indicate actual changes in underlying rates our revenue per hundredweight excluding fuel surcharges increased 39 in 2012 despite the negative influence of the increase in weight per shipment and decrease in length of haul 

fuel surcharge revenue increased to 167 of revenue in 2012 from 164 in 2011 primarily due to a slight increase in the average price per gallon for diesel fuel most of our tariffs and contracts provide for a fuel surcharge which is recorded as additional revenue as diesel fuel prices increase above stated levels these levels are generally indexed to the doe’s published fuel prices that reset each week the fuel surcharge is one of many components included in the overall negotiated price for our transportation services with our customers although it is generally considered to be a measure of the increase in cost of all petroleum products we use we regularly monitor the components of our pricing including base freight rates and fuel surcharges we also address any individual account profitability issues with our customers as part of our effort to minimize the negative impact on our profitability that would likely result from a rapid and significant change in any of our operating expenses 

operating costs and other expenses 

salaries wages and benefits increased 1105 million or 116 in 2012 due to a 728 million increase in the costs for salaries and wages and a 377 million increase in benefit costs the increase in the costs for our salaries and wages excluding benefits was due primarily to a 69 increase in average fulltime employees over 2011 and the impact of wage increases provided to employees in september 2011 and 2012 the increase in our headcount was necessary to ensure adequate labor capacity for the increase in shipments during 2012 as well as for projected growth as a result our direct labor costs for drivers platform employees and fleet technicians increased 552 million or 108 in 2012 as compared to 2011 although these costs increased during 2012 our salaries and wages as a percent of revenue improved to 378 from 385 in 2011 as a result of the increased density and efficiency in our operations our platform pounds handled per hour pd stops per hour and pd shipments per hour improved 40 07 and 05 respectively over the prioryear period 

employee benefit costs increased 377 million primarily due to an increase in the number of fulltime employees eligible for benefits an increase in paid time off for employees and an increase in the cost per employee for our group health and dental plans as a percentage of salaries and wages employee benefit costs increased slightly to 337 in 2012 from 319 in 2011 

operating supplies and expenses increased 233 million in 2012 primarily due to the increases in the costs of diesel fuel excluding fuel taxes which represents the largest component of operating supplies and expenses diesel fuel costs can vary based on both consumption and average price per gallon both of which increased over 2011 gallons consumed and average price per gallon increased 51 and 24 respectively in 2012 as compared to 2011 although we saw increases in these costs operating supplies and expenses decreased as a percent of revenue to 179 in 2012 from 189 in 2011 we attribute this improvement primarily to certain operational initiatives and the increased use of newer more fuelefficient equipment during 2012 we do not use diesel fuel hedging instruments and are therefore subject to market price fluctuations 

depreciation and amortization expense increased to 53 of revenue in 2012 as compared to 48 in 2011 this increase was primarily due to the increase in our capital expenditure program for 2012 which included a significant increase in the number of tractors and trailers purchased in addition our unit costs for tractors have increased significantly due primarily to the impact of increasingly stringent emission standard requirements since 2002 the average cost of a new tractor in our fleet has increased approximately 45000 or 85 although our capital expenditure plan for 2013 is projected to be lower than 2012 we expect our continued growth and investments to increase depreciation costs in future periods 

our effective tax rate for 2012 was 380  as compared to 366  in 2011 our effective tax rate in 2011 was favorably impacted by tax credits related to our investment in alternative energyproducing assets and alternative fuel tax credits for the use of propane in our operations these alternative fuel tax credits expired on december 31 2011 however congress retroactively reinstated these credits for 2012 and extended the credits through december 31 2013 by passing the american taxpayer relief act of 2012 on january 1 2013 the impact of the retroactive application will be recorded as a favorable discrete tax benefit during the first quarter of 2013 

2011  compared to 2010   

key financial and operating metrics for 2011  and 2010  are presented below 



we experienced strong growth in both tonnage and revenue per hundredweight and we improved our productivity all of which led to significant margin improvement during 2011 tonnage growth in 2011 was primarily the result of our ability to 

win market share as well as a slight improvement in the overall us economy we believe our consistent strategy of providing “bestinclass” ontime and claimsfree service at a fair and equitable price resonates with shippers and will continue to help us win market share and fuel our growth our ability to win market share is supported by our belief that shippers are making decisions based more on the overall value of the service they receive rather than focusing simply on prices this change in philosophy occurred as many of our competitors implemented significant rate increases in 2011 and 2010 while we implemented a modest rate increase in 2011 we did not believe we had the headwinds that many of our competitors faced in making pricing decisions in 2012 as a result we believe the quality of our service and the consistency of our pricing is a winning strategy that will continue to provide opportunities for us to increase tonnage and market share in 2012 

the increase in revenue during 2011 as well as productivity improvements enabled us to leverage our fixed cost network and generate significant improvement in our operating results our net income increased in 2011 by 638 million or 844 to 1395 million and our operating ratio decreased by 310 basis points to 876 

revenue 

the 271 increase in revenue during 2011 was the result of increases in both tonnage and revenue per hundredweight tonnage increased 131 due to a 147 increase in shipments that was partially offset by a 14 decrease in weight per shipment while a decrease in weight per shipment has historically been an indicator of weakness in the economy we believe the decrease we experienced in 2011 was due to a decline in the number of heavier nontraditional ltl shipments such as fullcontainer load and truckload shipments as a percent of our total shipments 

revenue per hundredweight increased 125 to 1472 in 2011 this change reflects an improved ltl pricing environment that supported our rate increases as well as an increase in fuel surcharges our fuel surcharges are designed to offset fluctuations in the cost of petroleumbased products and are one of many components included in the overall price for our services revenue per hundredweight is a good indicator of pricing trends but this metric is influenced by many other factors such as changes in fuel surcharges weight per shipment length of haul and mix of freight therefore changes in revenue per hundredweight do not necessarily indicate actual changes in underlying rates our revenue per hundredweight excluding fuel surcharges increased 71 in 2011 but was positively influenced by the decrease in weight per shipment and an increase in length of haul 

fuel surcharge revenue increased to 164 of revenue from 123 in 2010 due to the increased price of diesel fuel during 2011 most of our tariffs and contracts provide for a fuel surcharge which is recorded as additional revenue as diesel fuel prices increase above stated levels these levels are generally indexed to the doe’s published fuel prices that reset each week the fuel surcharge is one of many components included in the overall negotiated price for our transportation services with our customers although it is generally considered to be a measure of the increase in cost of all petroleum products we use we regularly monitor the components of our pricing including base freight rates and fuel surcharges we also address any individual account profitability issues with our customers as part of our effort to minimize the negative impact on our profitability that would likely result from a rapid and significant change in any of our operating expenses 

operating costs and other expenses 

salaries wages and benefits increased 1473 million or 182 in 2011 which compares favorably with our revenue growth of 271 as a result our salaries wages and benefits improved to 508 of revenue from 546 in 2010 salaries and wages excluding benefits increased 1099 million due to a 76 increase in the total number of fulltime employees and the impact from salary and wage increases provided to our employees in september 2011 and 2010 in addition there was an increase in performancebased compensation due to the improvement in our financial and operational results these increases were partially offset by the improved productivity of our linehaul pd and platform operations that resulted from increased density and a continued focus on efficiency our linehaul laden load average pd shipments per hour and platform pounds handled per hour improved 03 11 and 01 respectively 

employee benefit costs increased 373 million primarily due to an increase in the number of fulltime employees increased costs related to our group health plan and higher payrollrelated taxes as a percentage of salaries and wages employee benefit costs increased slightly to 319 in 2011 from 315 in 2010 our group health plan requires a 90day waiting period before newly hired employees are eligible to enroll a significant number of employees were hired in the second half of 2010 and as a result our group health costs increased as these new employees began to enroll in our plan in 2011 in addition our group health costs increased due to changes required by the 2010 patient protection and affordable care act which required us to provide dependant coverage until the age of 26 

operating supplies and expenses increased to 189 of revenue in 2011 from 165 in 2010 this increase is primarily due to the increase in diesel fuel costs excluding fuel taxes which is the largest component of operating supplies and expenses these costs increased 528 during the year as a result of the combined effect of a 297 increase in our average price per gallon and a 127 increase in gallons consumed the increase in fuel consumption is primarily due to a 147 yearoveryear increase in overall miles driven that was partially offset by an improvement in our average miles per gallon our increased fuel consumption also resulted in an increase in our fuel tax expenses and was the principal driver of the 79 million increase in “operating taxes and licenses” we do not use diesel fuel hedging instruments and are therefore subject to market price fluctuations 

depreciation and amortization expense decreased to 48 of revenue in 2011 as compared to 54 in 2010 although our capital expenditure requirements increased in 2011 we were able to offset the cost of these additions by utilizing the available capacity of our fleet and service center network to create operating leverage on the 131 increase in tonnage our capital expenditure plan for 2012 is projected to be higher than 2011 and as a result our depreciation costs will likely increase in future periods 

we purchase linehaul transportation and pd services from other motor carriers and railroads we also utilize independent contractors for our container operations we utilize these services when it is economically beneficial or when there are imbalances of freight flow within our service center network purchased transportation expense remained consistent at 34 of revenue in 2011 and 2010 as it is typically more efficient and profitable for us to utilize our own personnel and equipment we expect to continue to focus on balancing our internal resources with freight demand in an effort to reduce our use of purchased transportation in future periods 

our effective tax rate for 2011 was 366 as compared to 392 in 2010 our effective tax rates in 2011 and 2010 were favorably impacted by alternative fuel tax credits for the use of propane in our operations these fuel tax credits were originally scheduled to expire on december 31 2009 however they were extended to december 31 2011 with the passage of the tax relief unemployment insurance reauthorization and job creation act of 2010 our 2011 rate also included the favorable impact of tax credits related to our investment in alternative energyproducing assets 

liquidity and capital resources 

a summary of our cash flows is presented below 



the changes in our cash flows provided by operating activities for the periods presented above are due primarily to the significant improvement in our net income which increased 300 million in 2012 and 638 million in 2011 over the comparable periods in 2011 and 2010 respectively this increase is more fully described above in item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations – results of operations ” depreciation and amortization expenses also increased 199 million in 2012 and 105 million in 2011 over the comparable periods of 2011 and 2010 respectively which is primarily due to the ongoing execution of our capital expenditure program and more fully described in item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations – capital expenditures”    

changes in cash flows used in investing activities are primarily due to changes in our capital expenditures over the periods compared the changes in our capital expenditure program are more fully described in item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations – capital expenditures”   

changes in cash flows used in or provided by financing activities consist of fluctuations in our senior unsecured revolving line of credit scheduled principal payments under our longterm debt agreements and debt and equity issuances during 2011 in 2011 we completed a 950 million private placement of senior notes and we received net proceeds of 484 

million resulting from the issuance of our common stock both of which are discussed in more detail below a portion of the proceeds from these transactions was used to satisfy the outstanding balance on our senior unsecured revolving line of credit 

we have three primary sources of available liquidity cash and cash equivalents cash flows from operations and available borrowings under our senior unsecured revolving credit agreement which is described below we believe we also have sufficient access to debt and equity markets to provide other sources of liquidity if needed 

on january 3 2011 we entered into a note purchase agreement pursuant to which we issued 950 million of privatelyplaced senior notes we entered into this note purchase agreement to fund planned capital expenditures and for general corporate purposes we used a portion of the proceeds to refinance existing indebtedness including paying down the outstanding balance on our senior unsecured revolving credit agreement 

pursuant to an automatic shelf registration statement previously filed with the securities and exchange commission the “sec” we filed a prospectus supplement and entered into an atthemarket equity offering sales agreement on february 2 2011 with stifel nicolaus  company incorporated “stifel nicolaus weisel” under which we had the ability to issue and sell from time to time over a 12month period through or to stifel nicolaus weisel shares of our common stock having an aggregate offering price of up to 1000 million the “atm program” from february 2 2011 through december 31 2011 we issued 2274568 shares of common stock pursuant to the atm program at an average price of 2179 per share after adjusting for a threefortwo stock split effected on september 7 2012 we received aggregate gross proceeds of 496 million and aggregate net proceeds of 484 million after deducting commissions and other transaction costs of 12 million there were no subsequent issuances pursuant to the atm program through february 2 2012 which was the date on which the atm program expired our automatic shelf registration statement that provided us with the opportunity to offer and sell shares of common stock on a delayed or continuous basis at indeterminate prices expired in the fourth quarter of 2012 

capital expenditures 

the table below sets forth our net capital expenditures for property and equipment including those obtained through capital leases for the years ended december 31 2012  2011  and 2010  



our capital expenditure requirements are generally based upon the projected increase in the number and size of our service center facilities to support our plan for longterm growth our planned tractor and trailer replacement cycle and anticipated tonnage growth expenditures for land and structures increased in 2012 as we expanded the capacity of our service center network which included the expansion of two of our major breakbulk facilities our capital expenditures for tractors and trailers increased significantly in 2012 and 2011 to support our projected tonnage growth as well as to replace equipment being retired through our normal replacement cycle in 2010 we limited our purchases of these assets as we had sufficient capacity to meet demand 

we currently estimate capital expenditures net of anticipated proceeds from sales will be approximately 2700 million for the year ending december 31 2013 approximately 950 million is allocated for the purchase of service center facilities construction of new service center facilities or expansion of existing service center facilities subject to the availability of suitable real estate and the timing of construction projects approximately 1500 million is allocated for the purchase of tractors trailers and other equipment and approximately 250 million is allocated for investments in technology and other assets we expect to fund these capital expenditures primarily through cash flows from operations our existing cash and cash equivalents and the use of our senior unsecured revolving credit facility if needed we believe our current sources of liquidity will be sufficient to satisfy our expected capital expenditures 

we anticipate that there will be additional environmental regulations and legislation resulting from the increased regulatory focus on climate change and greenhouse gas emissions in the united states at this time we cannot predict the 

requirements of any future regulations however any limitations on the emission of greenhouse gases or other environmental legislation could increase our future capital expenditures and have an adverse impact on our financial condition results of operations and liquidity 

financing agreements 

we have a fiveyear 2000 million senior unsecured revolving credit facility pursuant to the terms of a second amended and restated credit agreement dated august 10 2011 the “credit agreement” with wells fargo bank national association “wells fargo” serving as administrative agent for the lenders of the 2000 million line of credit commitments 1500 million may be used for letters of credit and 200 million may be used for borrowings under the wells fargo sweep plus loan program this sweep program is a daily cash management tool that automatically initiates borrowings to cover overnight cash requirements up to an aggregate of 200 million in addition we have the right to request an increase in the line of credit commitments up to a total of 3000 million in minimum increments of 250 million 

at our option revolving loans under the facility bear interest at either a the applicable margin percentage for base rate loans plus the higher of wells fargo’s prime rate the federal funds rate plus 05 per annum or the one month libor rate plus 10 per annum b the libor rate plus the applicable margin percentage for libor loans or c the libor market index rate “libor index rate” plus the applicable margin percentage for libor market index loans the applicable margin percentage is determined by a pricing grid in the credit agreement and ranges from 10 to 1875 the applicable margin percentage was 1125 at december 31 2012  and 2011  respectively and ranged from 10 to 1125 during 2012  revolving loans under the sweep program bear interest at the libor index rate 

the credit agreement contains customary covenants including financial covenants that require us to observe a maximum ratio of debt to total capital and a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio any future whollyowned subsidiaries of old dominion would be required to guarantee payment of all of our obligations under the facility the amounts outstanding and remaining borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facilities are presented below 



commitment fees ranging from 0175 to 030 are charged quarterly in arrears on the aggregate unutilized portion of the credit agreement letter of credit fees equal to the applicable margin for adjusted libor rate loans are charged quarterly in arrears on the daily average aggregate stated amount of all letters of credit outstanding during the quarter the commitment fees ranged from 0175 to 020 and letter of credit fees ranged from 10 to 1125 during 2012  in addition a facing fee at an annual rate of 0125 is charged quarterly in arrears on the daily average aggregate stated amount of all letters of credit outstanding during such quarter 

we have three outstanding unsecured senior note agreements with an aggregate amount outstanding of 2271 million  at december 31 2012  these notes call for periodic principal payments with maturities that range from 2015 to 2021 of which 357 million  is due in the next twelve months interest rates on these notes are fixed and range from 400 to 585 the effective average interest rate on our outstanding senior note agreements was 507  and 517  at december 31 2012  and 2011  respectively 

with the exception of borrowings pursuant to the credit agreement interest rates are fixed on all of our debt instruments therefore shortterm exposure to fluctuations in interest rates is limited to our line of credit facility we do not currently use interest rate derivative instruments to manage exposure to interest rate changes 

our credit agreement limits the amount of dividends that could be paid to shareholders to the greater of i 200 million ii the amount of dividends paid in the immediately preceding fiscal year or iii an amount equal to 25 of net income from the immediately preceding fiscal year we did not declare or pay a dividend on our common stock in 2012  or 2011  and we have no plans to declare or pay a dividend in 2013  

a significant decrease in demand for our services could limit our ability to generate cash flow and affect profitability most of our debt agreements have covenants that require stated levels of financial performance which if not achieved could 

cause acceleration of the payment schedules as of december 31 2012  we were in compliance with these covenants we do not anticipate a significant decline in business levels or financial performance that would cause us to violate any such covenants in the future and we believe the combination of our existing credit agreement along with our additional borrowing capacity will be sufficient to meet foreseeable seasonal and longterm capital needs

the following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations as of december 31 2012  



  

 

critical accounting policies 

in preparing our financial statements we apply the following critical accounting policies that we believe affect our judgments and estimates of amounts recorded in certain assets liabilities revenue and expenses these critical accounting policies are further described in note 1 of the notes to the financial statements included in item 8 of this report 

revenue recognition 

we recognize revenue based upon when our transportation services have been completed in accordance with the bill of lading contract our general tariff provisions or contractual agreements with our customers generally this occurs when we complete the delivery of a shipment for transportation services not completed at the end of a reporting period we use a percentage of completion method to allocate the appropriate revenue to each separate reporting period under this method we develop a factor for each uncompleted shipment by dividing the actual number of days in transit at the end of a reporting period by that shipment’s standard delivery time schedule this factor is applied to the total revenue for that shipment and revenue is allocated between reporting periods accordingly 

allowances for uncollectible accounts and revenue adjustments 

we maintain an allowance for uncollectible accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments we estimate this allowance by analyzing the aging of our customer receivables our historical loss experience and other trends and factors affecting the credit risk of our customers we determine customer receivables to be past due when payment has not been received by the invoice due date writeoffs occur when we determine an account to be uncollectible and could differ from our allowance estimate as a result of factors such as changes in the overall economic environment or risks surrounding our customers additional allowances may be required if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments we periodically review the underlying assumptions in our estimate of the allowance for uncollectible accounts to ensure that the allowance reflects the most recent trends and factors 

we also maintain an allowance for estimated revenue adjustments resulting from future billing corrections customer allowances moneyback service guarantees and other miscellaneous revenue adjustments these revenue adjustments are recorded in our revenue from operations we use historical experience trends and current information to update and evaluate these estimates 

claims and insurance accruals 

claims and insurance accruals reflect the estimated cost of claims for cargo loss and damage bipd workers’ compensation longterm disability group health and dental not covered by insurance the related costs are charged to insurance and claims expense except for workers’ compensation longterm disability group health and dental which are charged to employee benefits expense 

insurers providing excess coverage above retention levels adjust their premiums to cover insured losses and for other market factors as a result we periodically evaluate our selfinsured retention levels to determine the most costefficient balance between our retention exposure and excess coverage 

in establishing accruals for claims and insurance expenses we evaluate and monitor each claim individually and we use factors such as historical claims development experience known trends and thirdparty estimates to determine the appropriate reserves for potential liability we believe the assumptions and methods used to estimate these liabilities are reasonable however any changes in the severity of previouslyreported claims significant changes in the medical costs and regulatory changes affecting the administration of our plans could significantly impact the determination of appropriate reserves in future periods 

property and equipment 

property and equipment are recorded at cost and depreciated on a straightline basis over their estimated economic lives we use historical experience certain assumptions and estimates in determining the economic life of each asset periodically we review property and equipment for impairment due to changes in operational and market conditions and we adjust the carrying value and economic life of any impaired asset as appropriate 

effective january 1 2010 estimated economic lives for structures are 7 to 30 years revenue equipment is 4 to 15 years other equipment is 2 to 20 years and leasehold improvements are the lesser of the economic life of the leasehold improvement or the remaining life of the lease the use of different assumptions estimates or significant changes in the resale market for our equipment could result in material changes in the carrying value and related depreciation of our assets 

during the first quarter of 2010 we completed an evaluation of the estimated useful lives and salvage values for our equipment and determined that the actual period of service of certain revenue equipment exceeded that of our previously estimated useful lives as a result we extended the estimated useful lives of most of our tractors to 9 years from 7 years and extended the estimated useful lives of our trailers to 15 years from 12 years in addition we reduced the estimated salvage values associated with this equipment to more accurately reflect the value we believe such equipment will have at the end of its respective useful life we made similar changes to the estimated useful lives and salvage values for certain of our other equipment but the results of these changes had less of an impact on our future depreciation expense as a result of the impact on depreciation from these changes that were effective january 1 2010 income from continuing operations and net income in 2010 increased by approximately 127 million and 77 million respectively 

inflation 

most of our expenses are affected by inflation which typically results in increased operating costs in response to fluctuations in the cost of petroleum products particularly diesel fuel we generally include a fuel surcharge in our tariffs and contractual agreements the fuel surcharge is designed to offset the cost of diesel fuel above a base price and increases as diesel fuel prices escalate over the base which is generally indexed to the doe’s published fuel prices that reset each week volatility in the price of diesel fuel independent of inflation has impacted our business as described in this report however we do not believe inflation has had a material effect on our results of operations for each of the past three years 

related person transactions 

family relationships 

each of earl e congdon john r congdon david s congdon and john r congdon jr are related to one another and served in various executive management positions andor on our board of directors during 2012  we have entered into amended and restated employment agreements with earl e congdon and david s congdon which are incorporated by reference as exhibits to our annual report on form 10k we regularly disclose the amount of compensation that we pay to these individuals as well as any of their family members employed by us and whose compensation from time to time may require disclosure in the proxy statement for our annual meeting of shareholders 

during 2012 john r congdon resigned from his position as senior vice president but continues to be employed by the company in connection with his resignation as a senior vice president the board of directors and mr congdon agreed to terminate the amended and restated employment agreement between the company and john r congdon 

transactions with old dominion truck leasing inc 

old dominion truck leasing inc “leasing” is a north carolina corporation whose voting stock is owned by an earl e congdon revocable trust the john r congdon revocable trust and members of earl e congdon’s and john r congdon’s families leasing is primarily engaged in the business of purchasing and leasing tractors trailers and other vehicles john r congdon is chairman of the board of leasing and earl e congdon is vice chairman of the board of leasing since 1986 we have combined our requirements with leasing for the purchase of tractors trailers equipment parts tires and fuel we believe that the termination of this arrangement would not have a material adverse impact on our financial results 

we purchased 239000  278000  and 242000  of maintenance and other services from leasing in 2012  2011  and 2010  respectively we believe that the prices we pay for such services are no more than what would be charged by unaffiliated third parties for the same quality of work and we intend to continue to purchase maintenance and other services from leasing provided that leasing’s prices continue to be favorable to us 

we also paid leasing 86000  for leased equipment in 2010 these payments were for longterm leases for tractors used in our linehaul operations we received no commission or other financial benefit from leasing or any other party in connection with these lease transactions we did not lease any equipment from leasing in 2012 or 2011 

we charged leasing 18000 18000 and 17000 for the rental of property in 2012  2011  and 2010  respectively no other services were provided to leasing for the years ended december 31 2012  2011  and 2010  

splitdollar life insurance policies 

we are the owner of two splitdollar life insurance contracts insuring the life of john r congdon the net cash surrender value for these policies was 68 million  and 66 million  at december 31 2012  and 2011  respectively and is included on our balance sheets under the caption “other assets” at december 31 2012  these policies provided for an aggregate of 89 million  in net death benefits due to the company of which we have endorsed 20 million  to mr congdon’s children 

audit committee approval 

the audit committee of our board of directors reviewed and approved all of the related person transactions described above in accordance with our related person transactions policy 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact our financial position results of operations and cash flows due to adverse changes in financial market prices and rates 

we are exposed to interest rate risk directly related to loans if any under our credit agreement which have variable interest rates a 100 basis point increase in the average interest rate on this agreement would have no material effect on our operating results we have established policies and procedures to manage exposure to market risks and use major institutions that we believe are creditworthy to minimize credit risk 

we are exposed to market risk for equity investments relating to companyowned life insurance contracts on certain employees at december 31 2012  the cash value for variable life insurance contracts was 223 million of the 331 million of aggregate cash values for all life insurance contracts included on our balance sheets variable life insurance contracts expose us to fluctuations in equity markets however we utilize a thirdparty to manage these assets and minimize that exposure a 10 change in market value in those investments would have a 22 million impact on our operating income 

we are exposed to market risk for awards granted under the old dominion freight line inc phantom stock plan and the old dominion freight line inc director phantom stock plan the liability for the unsettled outstanding awards is remeasured at the end of each reporting period based on the closing price of our common stock at that date at december 31 2012  the total liability for awards granted under the old dominion freight line inc phantom stock plan and the old dominion freight line inc director phantom stock plan totaled 162 million a 10 change in the price of our common stock at december 31 2012  would have had a 16 million impact on our operating income in 2012  with respect to these plans 

we are also exposed to commodity price risk related to diesel fuel prices and manage our exposure to that risk primarily through the application of fuel surcharges 

for further discussion related to these risks see notes 2 and 8 to the financial statements included in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” and item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations”

unless the context requires otherwise references in this report to “old dominion” the “company” “we” “us” and “our” refer to old dominion freight line inc 

overview 

old dominion is a leading lessthantruckload “ltl” unionfree motor carrier providing regional interregional and national ltl service and valueadded logistics services from a single integrated organization we are the seventh largest ltl motor carrier in the united states as measured by 2010 revenue according to transport topics  in addition to our core ltl services we offer our customers a broad range of logistics services including ground and air expedited transportation supply chain consulting transportation management truckload brokerage container delivery and warehousing services additionally in 2012 we expanded our logistics services to include consumer household moving services which provide customers with a selfservice moving option for their household goods through marketing and carrier relationships we also offer doortodoor international freight services to and from all of north america central america south america and the far east our services are complemented by our technological capabilities which we believe provide the tools to improve the efficiency of our operations while empowering our customers to manage their shipping needs 

we have grown our revenue and customer base through both organic growth and strategic acquisitions and provide our domestic ltl services throughout the entire continental united states our infrastructure allows us to provide nextday and secondday service within each of our six regions as well as interregional and national service between these regions to support our ongoing expansion we added 34 new service centers in the past five years for a total of 216 at december 31 2011 

we believe our growth can be attributed to our focus on meeting our customers’ complete supply chain needs from a single point of contact with a high level of customer service supported by ongoing investment in our employees service center network and technology our integrated structure allows us to offer our customers consistent highquality service from origin to destination we believe our operating structure and proprietary information systems also enable us to efficiently manage our operating costs which allows us to provide this highquality service at a fair and equitable price 

  

we were organized in 1934 and incorporated in virginia in 1950 our principal executive offices are located at 500 old dominion way thomasville north carolina 27360 please refer to the balance sheets and statements of operations included in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” of this report for information regarding our total assets revenue from operations and net income 

our industry 

trucking companies provide transportation services to virtually every industry operating in the united states and generally offer higher levels of reliability and faster transit times than other surface transportation options the trucking industry is comprised principally of two types of motor carriers ltl and truckload ltl carriers typically pick up multiple shipments from multiple customers on a single truck and then route that freight for delivery through service centers where the freight may be transferred to other trucks with similar destinations in contrast truckload carriers generally dedicate an entire trailer to one customer from origin to destination 

according to the american trucking associations total us freight transportation revenue in 2010 was 6942 billion of which the trucking industry accounted for 812 the ltl sector had revenue in 2010 of 404 billion which represented 58 of total us freight transportation revenue in contrast to truckload carriers ltl motor carriers require expansive networks of local pickup and delivery “pd” service centers as well as larger breakbulk or hub facilities significant capital is required of ltl motor carriers to create and maintain a network of service centers and a fleet of tractors and trailers the high fixed costs and capital spending requirements for ltl motor carriers makes it difficult for new startup or small operators to effectively compete with established companies in addition successful ltl motor carriers generally employ and continuously update a high level of technology to provide information to customers and to reduce operating costs 

the ltl industry is highly competitive on the basis of service and price and has consolidated significantly since the industry was deregulated in 1980 based on 2010 revenue as reported in transport topics  the top 25 ltl motor carriers accounted for approximately 67 of the total ltl market consolidation has accelerated in recent years due to an increase in customer demand for single transportation providers offering both national and regional ltl service and complex supply chain services smaller regional carriers with lesser financial resources are generally unable to meet this demand as a result we believe consolidation in our industry will continue 

competition 

we compete with regional interregional and national ltl carriers and to a lesser extent with truckload carriers small package carriers airfreight carriers and railroads competition is based primarily on service price and business relationships we believe we are able to compete effectively in our markets by providing highquality and timely service at competitive prices 

at all levels of our organization we seek to continuously improve customer service by maximizing ontime performance while reducing transit times and minimizing cargo claims we believe our transit times are generally faster than those of our principal national competitors in part because of our more efficient service center network use of team drivers and proprietary technology in addition we provide greater geographic coverage than most of our regional competitors our diversified mix and scope of regional interregional and national service combined with our valueadded service offerings enables us to provide our customers with a single source to meet their shipping and logistics needs we believe this provides us with a distinct advantage over our regional multiregional and national competition 

we utilize flexible scheduling and train our unionfree employees to perform multiple tasks which we believe allows us to achieve greater productivity and higher levels of customer service than our competitors we believe our focus on employee communication continued education development and motivation strengthens the relationships and trust among our employees 

we compete with several larger transportation service providers each of which may have more equipment a broader global network and a wider range of services than we have our larger competitors may also have greater financial resources and in general the ability to reduce prices to gain business especially during times of reduced growth rates in the economy 

  

service center operations 

at december 31 2011 we conducted operations through 216 service center locations of which we owned 139 and leased 77 we operate ten major breakbulk facilities in rialto california atlanta georgia chicago illinois indianapolis indiana greensboro north carolina harrisburg pennsylvania memphis and morristown tennessee dallas texas and salt lake city utah while using other service centers for limited breakbulk activity in order to serve our nextday markets our service centers are strategically located in six regions of the country to provide the highest quality service and minimize freight rehandling costs 

each of our service centers is responsible for the pickup and delivery of freight within its service area each service center loads outbound freight by destination the day it is picked up all inbound freight received by the service center in the evening or during the night is scheduled for local delivery the next business day unless a customer requests a different delivery schedule our management reviews the productivity and service performance of each service center on a daily basis to help ensure quality service and efficient operations 

while we have established primary responsibility for customer service at the local service center level our customers may access information and initiate transactions through our centralized customer service department located at our corporate office or through several other gateways such as our website electronic data interchange “edi” email and fax notification systems and automated voice response systems our systems offer direct access to information such as freight tracking shipping documents rate quotes rate databases and account activity these centralized systems and our customer service department provide our customers with a single point of contact to access information across all areas of our operations and for each of our service products 

linehaul transportation 

linehaul dispatchers control the movement of freight among service centers through integrated freight movement systems we also utilize loadplanning software to optimize efficiencies in our linehaul operations our senior management monitors freight movements transit times load factors and other productivity measurements to ensure that we maintain our highest levels of service and efficiency 

we utilize scheduled routes and additional linehaul dispatches as necessary to meet our published service standards in addition we lower our cost structure by maintaining flexible workforce rules and by primarily using twin 28foot trailers in our linehaul operations the use of twin 28foot trailers permits us to transport freight directly from its point of origin to destination with minimal unloading and reloading which also reduces cargo loss and damage expenses we utilize longcombination vehicles such as triple 28foot trailers and combinations of 48foot and 28foot trailers in states where permitted twin trailers and longcombination vehicles permit more freight to be hauled behind a tractor than could otherwise be hauled by one large trailer 

tractors trailers and maintenance 

at december 31 2011 we owned 5830 tractors we generally use new tractors in linehaul operations for approximately three to five years and then transfer those tractors to pd operations for the remainder of their useful lives in many of our service centers tractors perform pd functions during the day and linehaul functions at night to maximize tractor utilization 

  

at december 31 2011 we owned 22685 trailers we primarily purchase new trailers for our operations however we occasionally purchase preowned equipment that meets our specifications the purchase of preowned equipment can provide an excellent value but also can increase our fleet’s average age the table below reflects as of december 31 2011 the average age of our tractors trucks and trailers 

 

 we develop certain specifications for tractors and trailers and then negotiate the production and purchase of this equipment with several manufacturers these purchases are planned well in advance of anticipated delivery dates in order to accommodate manufacturers’ production schedules we believe there is sufficient capacity among suppliers to ensure an uninterrupted supply of equipment to support our operations 

the table below sets forth our capital expenditures for tractors and trailers for the years ended december 31 2011 2010 and 2009 for more information concerning our capital expenditures see item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations – liquidity and capital resources ” of this report 

 

 at december 31 2011 we had major maintenance operations at our service centers in rialto california denver colorado atlanta georgia indianapolis indiana kansas city and parsons kansas greensboro north carolina columbus ohio harrisburg pennsylvania morristown and memphis tennessee dallas texas and salt lake city utah in addition 19 other service center locations are equipped to perform routine and preventive maintenance and repairs on our equipment 

we adhere to established maintenance policies and procedures to help ensure our fleet is properly maintained linehaul tractors are routed to appropriate maintenance facilities at designated intervals depending upon how the equipment has been utilized pd tractors and trailers are scheduled for maintenance every 90 days 

marketing and customers 

at december 31 2011 we had a sales staff of 496 employees we compensate our sales force in part based upon certain operating metrics to help motivate our sales employees to achieve our service growth and profitability objectives 

we utilize an integrated freightcosting system to determine the price level at which a particular shipment of freight will be profitable we can modify elements of this freightcosting model to simulate the actual conditions under which the freight will be moved we also compete for business by participating in bid solicitations customers generally solicit bids for relatively large numbers of shipments for a period of one to two years and typically choose to enter into contractual arrangements with a limited number of motor carriers based upon price and service 

revenue is generated by customers dispersed primarily throughout the united states and north america in 2011 our largest customer accounted for approximately 26 of our revenue and our largest 5 10 and 20 customers accounted for approximately 91 143 and 214 of our revenue respectively for each of the previous three years approximately 90 of our revenue was derived from transporting ltl shipments for our customers and less than 5 of our revenue was generated from international services we believe the diversity of our customer base helps protect our business from adverse developments in a single geographic region and the reduction or loss of business from a single customer 

  

seasonality 

our operations are subject to seasonal trends common in the trucking industry our operating margins in the first quarter are normally lower due to reduced demand during the winter months harsh weather can also adversely affect our performance by reducing demand and reducing our ability to transport freight which could result in decreased revenue and increased operating expenses 

technology 

we continually upgrade our technological capabilities and we provide access to our systems through multiple gateways that offer our customers maximum flexibility and immediate access to information we employ vehicle safety systems onboard and handheld computer systems freight handling systems and logistics technology to reduce costs and transit times we continue to focus on the development and enhancement of the technology used in our operations in order to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of our services 

insurance 

we carry a significant amount of insurance with thirdparty insurance carriers but we are exposed to the risk of loss on claims up to the limit for which we are selfinsured we are currently selfinsured for bodily injury and property damage “bipd” claims up to 275 million per occurrence cargo loss and damage claims are selfinsured up to 100000 per occurrence we are exposed to workers’ compensation claims up to 10 million per occurrence through either selfinsurance or insurance deductibles effective january 1 2012 our group health claims are selfinsured up to 400000 per occurrence an increase from 375000 in 2011 plus an aggregate 200000 over our retention level 

we believe that our policy of selfinsuring a portion of our risks supported by our safety and loss prevention programs is an effective means of managing insurance costs we also believe that our current insurance coverage is adequate to cover our liability risks 

diesel fuel availability and cost 

our industry depends heavily upon the availability of diesel fuel although we maintained fuel storage and pumping facilities at 47 or 22 of our service center locations at december 31 2011 we may experience shortages at certain locations and may be forced to incur additional expense to help ensure adequate supply on a timely basis to prevent a disruption to our service schedules we implemented a fuel surcharge program in august 1999 which has remained in effect since that time and is one of many components that we use to determine the overall price for our transportation services our fuel surcharges are generally indexed to fuel prices published by the us department of energy the “doe” that reset each week our management believes that our operations and financial condition are susceptible to the same diesel fuel price increases or shortages as those of our competitors diesel fuel costs including fuel taxes totaled 150 131 and 114 of revenue in 2011 2010 and 2009 respectively 

employees 

as of december 31 2011 we employed 12022 individuals on a fulltime basis none of which were represented under a collective bargaining agreement our fulltime employees work in the following roles 

 

   

as of december 31 2011 we employed 3150 linehaul drivers and 3211 pd drivers on a fulltime basis we select our drivers primarily based upon safe driving records and experience each of our drivers is required to pass a drug test have a current us department of transportation “dot” physical and have a valid commercial driver’s license prior to employment once employed drivers are required to obtain and maintain hazardous materials endorsements to their commercial driver’s licenses drivers as well as all employees are required to take preemployment drug and alcohol tests and are randomly selected for periodic additional testing 

to help fulfill driver needs we offer qualified employees the opportunity to become drivers through the “old dominion driver training program” since its inception in 1988 2994 individuals have graduated from this program of the program graduates we have experienced an annual turnover rate of approximately 71 which is below our companywide average turnover rate of approximately 125 for drivers we believe our driver training and qualification programs have been important factors in improving our safety record and retaining our qualified drivers drivers with safe driving records are rewarded with bonuses of up to 3000 payable each year driver safety bonuses paid during 2011 and 2010 were 23 million and 21 million respectively 

governmental regulation 

we are subject to regulation by the federal motor carrier safety administration the “fmcsa” the pipeline and hazardous materials safety agency and the surface transportation board which are agencies within the dot as well as the regulations of various state agencies these regulatory authorities have broad powers generally governing matters such as authority to engage in motor carrier operations motor carrier registration driver hours of service safety and fitness of transportation equipment and drivers certain mergers consolidations and acquisitions and periodic financial reporting in addition we are subject to compliance with cargosecurity and transportation regulations issued by the transportation security administration within the us department of homeland security 

in october 2009 the us court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit ordered the fmcsa to review and reissue rules governing hours of service for commercial truck drivers by july 26 2011 this deadline was extended and on december 22 2011 the fmcsa issued its final rule which requires compliance by july 1 2013 the final rule reduces the maximum number of hours a truck driver can work each week to 70 hours from the current 82hour limit the rule maintains the current maximum 11hour daily driving limit but requires drivers to take a 30minute break prior to driving beyond eight hours the rule also includes a “34hour restart” provision that allows drivers to restart the clock on their work week by taking at least 34 consecutive hours offduty provided these 34 offduty hours includes two periods between 100 am and 500 am and occurs only once during a sevenday period we do not believe this new rule when implemented will have a significant impact on our operating procedures and will not significantly impact our costs we are however subject to future rulemaking by the fmcsa which could be more stringent require changes to our operations increase our operating costs and otherwise adversely impact our results of operations 

the trucking industry is subject to regulatory and legislative changes from a variety of other governmental authorities which address matters such as i increasingly stringent environmental and occupational safety and health regulations ii limits on vehicle weight and size iii ergonomics iv port security and v hours of service these changes may affect our business or the economics of our industry by requiring changes in operating practices or by influencing the demand for and increasing the costs of providing our services 

environmental regulation 

we are subject to various federal state and local environmental laws and regulations that focus on among other things the emission and discharge of hazardous materials into the environment or their presence on or in our properties and vehicles fuel storage tanks transportation of certain materials and the discharge or retention of storm water under specific environmental laws we could also be held responsible for any costs relating to contamination at our past or present facilities and at thirdparty waste disposal sites as well as costs associated with cleanup of accidents involving our vehicles we do not believe that the cost of future compliance with current environmental laws or regulations will have a material adverse effect on our operations financial condition competitive position or capital expenditures for the remainder of fiscal year 2012 or fiscal year 2013 however future changes to laws or regulations may adversely affect our operations and could result in unforeseen costs to our business

 item 1a risk factors 

various factors exist that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those projected in any forwardlooking statement in addition to the factors discussed elsewhere in this report we believe the following are some of the important risks and uncertainties that could materially affect our business financial condition or results of operations 

we operate in a highly competitive industry and our business will suffer if we are unable to adequately address potential downward pricing pressures and other factors that may adversely affect our operations and profitability 

numerous competitive factors could impair our ability to maintain our current profitability these factors include but are not limited to the following 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 if we are unable to effectively compete with other ltl carriers whether on the basis of price service or otherwise we may be unable to retain existing customers or attract new customers either of which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

  

if our employees were to unionize our operating costs would increase and our ability to compete would be impaired 

none of our employees are currently represented under a collective bargaining agreement however from time to time there have been efforts to organize our employees at various service centers further congress or one or more states could approve legislation significantly affecting our business and our relationship with our employees such as the proposed federal legislation referred to as the employee free choice act which would substantially liberalize the procedures for union organization in addition we can offer no assurance that the department of labor will not adopt new regulations or interpret existing regulations in a manner that would favor the agenda of unions or that our employees will not unionize in the future particularly if regulatory changes occur that facilitate unionization 

the unionization of our employees could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations because 

 

  

  

  

  

 if we are unable to successfully execute our growth strategy our business and future results of operations may suffer 

our growth strategy includes increasing the volume of freight moving through our existing service center network selectively expanding our geographic footprint and broadening the scope of our service offerings in connection with our growth strategy at various times we have made selective acquisitions purchased additional equipment expanded and upgraded service centers and increased our sales and marketing efforts and we expect to continue to do so our growth strategy exposes us to a number of risks including the following 

 

  

  

  

  

 we cannot assure that we will overcome the risks associated with our growth strategy if we fail to overcome those risks we may not realize additional revenue or profits from our efforts we may incur additional expenses and therefore our financial position and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 

we may be unable to successfully consummate and integrate acquisitions as part of our growth strategy 

growth through acquisitions has been a key component of our ltl growth strategy throughout our history in the future we may seek to acquire other ltl carriers as well as other complementary businesses exploration of potential acquisitions requires significant attention from our senior management team in addition we expect to compete for acquisition opportunities with other companies some of which may have greater financial and other resources than we do we cannot assure that we will 

  

have sufficient cash with which to consummate an acquisition or otherwise be able to obtain financing for any acquisition if we are unable to access sufficient funding for potential acquisitions we may not be able to complete transactions that we otherwise find advantageous 

any subsequent acquisition will entail numerous risks including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 in addition we may have difficulty integrating any acquired business and its operations services and personnel into our existing operations and such integration may require a significant amount of time and effort by our management team to the extent we do not successfully avoid or overcome the risks or problems resulting from any acquisitions we undertake there could be a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our customers’ and suppliers’ business may be impacted by a downturn in the economy andor a disruption of financial markets 

adverse economic conditions can negatively affect our customers’ business levels the amount of transportation services they need their ability to pay for our services and overall freight levels all of which might impair our asset utilization customers encountering adverse economic conditions may be unable to obtain additional financing or financing under acceptable terms due to disruptions in the capital and credit markets these customers represent a greater potential for bad debt losses which may require us to increase our reserve for bad debt economic conditions resulting in bankruptcies of one or more of our large customers could have a significant impact on our financial position results of operations or liquidity in a particular year or quarter further when adverse economic times arise customers may bid out freight or select competitors that offer lower rates from among existing choices in an attempt to lower their costs and we might be forced to lower our rates or lose freight 

our suppliers’ business levels also may be negatively affected by adverse economic conditions or financial constraints which could lead to disruptions in the supply and availability of equipment parts and services critical to our operations a significant interruption in our normal supply chain could disrupt our operations increase our costs and negatively impact our ability to serve our customers 

we also are subject to cost increases outside our control that could materially reduce our profitability if we are unable to increase our rates sufficiently such cost increases include but are not limited to increases in fuel prices driver wages interest rates taxes tolls license and registration fees insurance revenue equipment and healthcare for our employees 

increases in driver compensation or other difficulties attracting and retaining qualified drivers could adversely affect our profitability and ability to maintain or grow our fleet 

from time to time we have experienced difficulty in attracting and retaining sufficient numbers of qualified drivers and such shortages may recur in the future because of the intense competition for drivers we may face difficulty maintaining or increasing our number of drivers the compensation we offer our drivers is subject to market conditions that may require increases in driver compensation which 

  

becomes more likely as economic conditions improve if we are unable to attract and retain a sufficient number of drivers we could be required to adjust our compensation packages or operate with fewer trucks and face difficulty meeting shipper demands all of which could adversely affect our profitability and ability to maintain our size or grow 

insurance and claims expenses could significantly reduce our profitability 

we are exposed to claims related to cargo loss and damage property damage personal injury workers’ compensation longterm disability group health and dental we have insurance coverage with thirdparty insurance carriers but selfinsure for a significant portion of the risk associated with these claims our operating results would be adversely affected if any of the following were to occur i the number or severity of claims for which we are selfinsured increases ii we are required to accrue or pay additional amounts because the claims prove to be more severe than our original assessment or iii claims exceed our excess coverage amounts if claims exceed our retention levels or insurance market conditions change insurers could raise premiums for excess coverage to cover their expenses and anticipated future losses in addition insurance companies require us to obtain letters of credit to collateralize our selfinsured retention if these requirements increase our borrowing capacity could be adversely affected 

we have significant ongoing cash requirements that could limit our growth and affect our profitability if we are unable to obtain sufficient capital 

our business is highly capital intensive we generally finance our capital expenditures and planned growth with existing cash cash flow from operations issuance of debt and through available borrowings under our existing senior unsecured credit agreement we may require additional capital to finance longterm real estate purchase opportunities and acquisitions which we may fund through additional debt or through equity offerings if we are unable in the future to generate sufficient cash from our operations or raise capital by accessing the debt and equity markets we may be forced to limit our growth and operate our equipment for longer periods of time which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results 

our business also has significant ongoing operating cash requirements if our cash requirements are high or our cash flow from operations is low during particular periods we may need to seek additional financing which may be costly or difficult to obtain 

limited supply and increased prices for new equipment may adversely affect our earnings and cash flow 

we may face difficulty in purchasing new equipment due to decreased supply and increased costs investment in new equipment is a significant part of our annual capital expenditures and we require an available supply of tractors and trailers from equipment manufacturers to operate and grow our business we are also subject to shortages in raw materials that are required for the production of critical operating equipment and supplies such as shortages in rubber or steel 

the price of our equipment may also be adversely affected in the future by regulations on newly manufactured tractors and diesel engines we have incurred significant increases in the cost of tractors due to the us environmental protection agency’s the “epa” regulations that require progressive reductions in exhaust emissions from diesel engines beginning in october 2002 new diesel engines were required to meet these new emission limits some of the regulations required reductions in the sulfur content of diesel fuel beginning in june 2006 and the introduction of emissions aftertreatment devices on newlymanufactured engines and vehicles beginning with modelyear 2007 the final phase of these regulations required reduced nitrogen and nonmethane hydrocarbon emissions beginning with modelyear 2010 these regulations have resulted in higher prices for tractors and diesel engines and increased operating and maintenance costs and there can be no assurance that continued increases in pricing or costs will not have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

a decrease in the demand and value of used equipment may impact our results of operations 

as we purchase new tractors as part of our normal replacement cycle each year we rely on the used equipment market to dispose of our older equipment oversupply in the transportation industry as well as 

  

adverse domestic and foreign economic conditions can negatively impact the demand for used tractors and therefore reduce the value we can obtain on our used equipment if we are unable to sell our older equipment at or above salvage value the resulting losses could have a significant impact on our results of operations 

we may be adversely impacted by fluctuations in the availability and price of diesel fuel 

diesel fuel is a critical component of our operations and a significant operating expense for our business diesel fuel prices and fuel availability can be impacted by factors beyond our control such as natural or manmade disasters political events price and supply decisions by oil producing countries and cartels terrorist activities armed conflict and world supply and demand imbalances we maintain fuel storage and pumping facilities at many of our service center locations however we may experience shortages in the availability of diesel fuel at certain locations and may be forced to incur additional expense to ensure adequate supply on a timely basis to prevent a disruption to our service schedules an interruption in the supply of diesel fuel could have a material adverse effect on our operating results 

we do not hedge against the risk of diesel fuel price increases an increase in diesel fuel prices or diesel fuel taxes or any change in federal or state regulations that results in such an increase could have a material adverse effect on our operating results we have fuel surcharge programs in place with a majority of our customers which have helped us offset the majority of the negative impact of the increased cost of diesel fuel and other petroleumbased products however we also incur fuel costs that cannot be recovered even with respect to customers with which we maintain fuel surcharge programs such as those costs associated with empty miles deadhead miles or the time when our engines are idling because our fuel surcharge recovery lags behind changes in fuel prices our fuel surcharge recovery may not capture the increased costs we pay for fuel especially when prices are rising leading to fluctuations in our levels of reimbursement we regularly monitor the components of our pricing including fuel surcharges and address individual account profitability issues with our customers when necessary however there can be no assurance that fuel surcharges can be maintained indefinitely or will be sufficiently effective in offsetting increases in diesel fuel prices 

we are subject to various environmental laws and regulations and costs of compliance with liabilities under or violations of existing or future environmental laws or regulations could adversely affect our business 

we are subject to various federal state and local environmental laws and regulations that govern among other things the emission and discharge of hazardous materials into the environment the presence of hazardous materials at our properties or in our vehicles fuel storage tanks the transportation of certain materials and the discharge or retention of storm water under certain environmental laws we could also be held responsible for any costs relating to contamination at our past or present facilities and at thirdparty waste disposal sites as well as costs associated with the cleanup of accidents involving our vehicles environmental laws have become and are expected to continue to be increasingly more stringent over time and there can be no assurance that our costs of complying with current or future environmental laws or liabilities arising under such laws will not have a material adverse effect on our business operations or financial condition 

in addition to the epa regulations on exhaust emissions with which we must comply there is an increased regulatory focus on climate change and greenhouse gas emissions in the united states as a result we may become subject to additional legislation or rulemaking that could adversely impact our business any future limitations on the emission of greenhouse gases or other environmental legislation could increase our future capital expenditures and have an adverse impact on our financial condition results of operations and liquidity 

we operate in a highly regulated industry and increased costs of compliance with or liability for violation of existing or future regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business 

we are regulated by the dot and by various state agencies these regulatory authorities have broad powers generally governing matters such as authority to engage in motor carrier operations as well as motor carrier registration driver hours of service safety and fitness of transportation equipment and drivers transportation of hazardous materials certain mergers and acquisitions and periodic financial reporting in addition the trucking industry is subject to regulatory and legislative changes from a variety 

  

of other governmental authorities which address matters such as i increasingly stringent environmental occupational safety and health regulations ii limits on vehicle weight and size iii ergonomics iv port security and v hours of service in addition we are subject to compliance with cargosecurity and transportation regulations issued by the transportation security administration within the us department of homeland security regulatory requirements and changes in regulatory requirements may affect our business or the economics of the industry by requiring changes in operating practices or by influencing the demand for and increasing the costs of providing transportation services 

in october 2009 the us court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit ordered the fmcsa to review and reissue rules governing hours of service for commercial truck drivers by july 26 2011 this deadline was extended and on december 22 2011 the fmcsa issued its final rule which requires compliance by july 1 2013 the final rule reduces the maximum number of hours a truck driver can work each week to 70 hours from the current 82hour limit the rule maintains the current maximum 11hour daily driving limit but requires drivers to take a 30minute break prior to driving beyond eight hours the rule also includes a “34hour restart” provision that allows drivers to restart the clock on their work week by taking at least 34 consecutive hours offduty provided these 34 offduty hours includes two periods between 100 am and 500 am and occurs only once during a sevenday period we do not believe this new rule when implemented will have a significant impact on our operating procedures and will not significantly impact our costs we are however subject to future rulemaking by the fmcsa and other regulatory agencies which could be more stringent require changes to our operations increase our operating costs and otherwise adversely impact our results of operations 

the implementation of fmcsa’s compliance safety accountability initiative “csa” could adversely impact our ability to hire qualified drivers meet our growth projections and maintain our customer relationships each of which could adversely impact our results of operations 

in december 2010 the fmcsa began implementation of csa a new compliance and enforcement initiative designed to monitor and improve commercial motor vehicle safety csa measures both the safety record of the motor carrier and the driver these measurements are scored and used by the fmcsa to identify potential safety risks and to direct enforcement action csa scores for transportation companies are currently available on the fmcsa’s website and will eventually replace safestat the fmcsa’s former safety measurement system 

our csa scores are dependent upon our safety and compliance experience which could change at any time in addition the safety standards prescribed in csa could change and our ability to maintain an acceptable score could be adversely impacted if we receive an unacceptable csa score our relationships with our customers could be damaged which could result in a loss of business 

the implementation of csa could also shrink the industry’s pool of drivers as those with unfavorable scores could leave the industry as a result the costs to attract train and retain qualified drivers could increase in addition a shortage of qualified drivers could increase driver turnover decrease asset utilization limit growth and adversely impact our results of operations 

our results of operations may be affected by seasonal factors and harsh weather conditions 

our operations are subject to seasonal trends common in the trucking industry our operating margins in the first quarter are normally lower due to reduced demand during the winter months harsh weather can also adversely affect our performance by reducing demand and reducing our ability to transport freight which could result in decreased revenue and increased operating expenses 

if we are unable to retain our key employees our financial condition results of operations and liquidity could be adversely affected 

our success will continue to depend upon the experience and leadership of our key employees and executive officers in that regard the loss of the services of any of our key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and liquidity 

  

our principal shareholders control a large portion of our outstanding common stock 

earl e congdon david s congdon john r congdon and members of their respective families beneficially own an aggregate of approximately 27 of the outstanding shares of our common stock as long as the congdon family controls a large portion of our voting stock they may be able to significantly influence the election of the entire board of directors and the outcome of all matters involving a shareholder vote the congdon family’s interests may differ from the interests of other shareholders and the status of their ownership could change at their discretion 

our financial results may be adversely impacted by potential future changes in accounting practices 

future changes in accounting standards or practices and related legal and regulatory interpretations of those changes may adversely impact public companies in general the transportation industry or our operations specifically new accounting standards or requirements such as a conversion from us generally accepted accounting principles to international financial reporting standards could change the way we record revenues expenses assets andor liabilities or could be costly to implement these types of regulations could have a negative impact on our financial position liquidity results of operations andor access to capital 

our information technology systems are subject to certain risks that we cannot control 

we have become increasingly reliant on our information systems for our operations as well as providing a valueadded service to our customers our information systems including our accounting systems are dependent upon thirdparty software global communications providers data network systems and other aspects of technology and internet infrastructure that are susceptible to failure or an adverse cyber incident although we have implemented redundant systems and network security measures our information technology remains susceptible to outages computer viruses breakins and similar disruptions such an event could inhibit our ability to provide services to our customers and the ability of our customers to access our systems in addition there could be a loss of confidential information corruption of data and damage to our brand image this may result in a reduction in demand for our services or the loss of customers that could have a negative impact on our financial condition results of operations and liquidity 

if we raise additional capital in the future your ownership in us could be diluted 

any issuance of equity we may undertake in the future to raise additional capital could cause the price of our common stock to decline or require us to issue shares at a price that is lower than that paid by holders of our common stock in the past which would result in those newly issued shares being dilutive if we obtain funds through a credit facility or through the issuance of debt or preferred securities these obligations and securities would likely have rights senior to your rights as a common shareholder which could impair the value of our common stock 

the market value of our common stock may fluctuate and could be substantially affected by various factors 

the price of our common stock on the nasdaq global select market or nasdaq constantly changes we expect that the market price of our common stock will continue to fluctuate our share price may fluctuate as a result of a variety of factors many of which are beyond our control these factors include among others 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

   

our common stock price may fluctuate significantly in the future and these fluctuations may be unrelated to our performance general market price declines or market volatility in the future could adversely affect the price of our common stock and the current market price of our common stock may not be indicative of future market prices 

our articles of incorporation our bylaws and virginia law contain provisions that could discourage delay or prevent a change in our control or our management 

provisions of our articles of incorporation bylaws and the laws of virginia the state in which we are incorporated may discourage delay or prevent a change in control of us or a change in management that shareholders may consider favorable these provisions 

 

  

  

  

  

 these provisions could discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for you and other shareholders to take certain corporate actions these provisions could also limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock

 item 2 properties 

we own our general office located in thomasville north carolina consisting of a twostory office building of approximately 160000 square feet on 301 acres of land at december 31 2011 we operated 216 service centers of which 139 were owned and 77 were leased our service centers that are owned include most of our larger facilities and account for 798 of the total door capacity in our network with the exception of our chicago illinois facility which has a lease that expires in 2021 we own our major breakbulk facilities each of our breakbulk facilities is listed below with the number of doors as of december 31 2011 

 

 our 216 facilities are strategically dispersed over the states in which we operate at december 31 2011 the terms of our leased properties ranged from monthtomonth to a lease that expires in 2023 we believe that as current leases expire we will be able to renew them or find comparable facilities without incurring any material negative impact on service to our customers or our operating results 

we also own 21 nonoperating properties all of which are held for lease or are planned for future use seven of these properties are leased with lease terms that range from monthtomonth to a lease that expires in 2013 

  

we believe that all of our properties are in good repair and are capable of providing the level of service required by current business levels and customer demands in addition we believe we have sufficient capacity in our service center network to accommodate a substantial increase in demand for our services 




 item 3 legal proceedings 

we are involved in various legal proceedings and claims that have arisen in the ordinary course of our business that have not been fully adjudicated many of these are covered in whole or in part by insurance our management does not believe that these actions when finally concluded and determined will have a material adverse effect upon our financial position liquidity or results of operations

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

overview 

we are a leading lessthantruckload “ltl” unionfree motor carrier providing regional interregional and national ltl service and valueadded logistics services from a single integrated organization in addition to our core ltl services we offer our customers a broad range of logistics services including ground and air expedited transportation supply chain consulting transportation management truckload brokerage container delivery and warehousing services as well as consumer household moving services through marketing and carrier relationships we also offer doortodoor international freight services to and from all of north america central america south america and the far east approximately 90 of our revenue has historically been derived from transporting ltl shipments for our customers whose demand for our services is generally tied to industrial production and the overall health of the us domestic economy 

  

in analyzing the components of our revenue we monitor changes and trends in the following key metrics 

 

  

  

  

 our primary revenue focus is to increase shipment and tonnage growth within our existing infrastructure generally referred to as increasing density thereby maximizing asset utilization and labor productivity we measure density over many different functional areas of our operations including revenue per service center linehaul load factor pd stops per hour pd shipments per hour platform pounds handled per hour and platform shipments per hour in addition to our focus on density it is critical for us to obtain an appropriate yield on the shipments we handle we manage our yields by focusing on individual account profitability we believe yield management and improvements in density are key components in our ability to produce profitable growth 

our primary cost elements are direct wages and benefits associated with the movement of freight operating supplies and expenses which includes fuel and equipment repair costs and depreciation of our equipment fleet and service center facilities we gauge our overall success in managing these costs by monitoring our operating ratio a measure of profitability calculated by dividing total operating expenses by revenue which also allows industrywide comparisons with our competition 

we continually upgrade our technological capabilities to improve our customer service and lower our operating costs our technology provides our customers with visibility of their shipments throughout our network increases the productivity of our workforce and provides key metrics from which we can monitor our processes 

  

results of operations 

the following table sets forth for the years indicated expenses and other items as a percentage of revenue from operations 

 

  

   

2011 compared to 2010 

key financial and operating metrics for 2011 and 2010 are presented below 

 

 our financial results for 2011 were the best we have produced in our 20 years as a public company and extended the momentum we built in 2010 we experienced strong growth in both tonnage and revenue per hundredweight and we improved our productivity all of which led to significant margin improvement tonnage growth in 2011 was primarily the result of our ability to win market share as well as a slight improvement in the overall us economy we believe our consistent strategy of providing “bestinclass” ontime and claimsfree service at a fair and equitable price resonates with shippers and will continue to help us win market share and fuel our growth our ability to win market share is supported by our belief that shippers are making decisions based more on the overall value of the service they receive than focusing simply on prices this change in philosophy occurred as many of our competitors implemented significant rate increases in 2011 and 2010 while we implemented a modest rate increase in 2011 we do not believe we have the headwinds that many of our competitors will face in making pricing decisions in 2012 as a result we believe the quality of our service and the consistency of our pricing is a winning strategy that will continue to provide opportunities for us to increase tonnage and market share in 2012 

the increase in revenue during 2011 as well as productivity improvements enabled us to leverage our fixed cost network and generate significant improvement in our operating results our net income increased in 2011 by 638 million or 844 to 1395 million and our operating ratio decreased by 310 basis points to 876 which is the best annual operating ratio produced in our company’s history 

revenue 

the 271 increase in revenue during 2011 was the result of increases in both tonnage and revenue per hundredweight tonnage increased 131 due to a 147 increase in shipments that was partially offset by a 14 decrease in weight per shipment while a decrease in weight per shipment has historically been an indicator of weakness in the economy we believe the decrease we experienced in 2011 was due to a decline in the number of heavier nontraditional ltl shipments such as fullcontainer load and truckload shipments as a percent of our total shipments 

revenue per hundredweight increased 125 to 1472 in 2011 this change reflects a much improved ltl pricing environment that supported our rate increases as well as an increase in fuel surcharges our fuel surcharges are designed to offset fluctuations in the cost of petroleumbased products and are one of many components included in the overall price for our services revenue per hundredweight is a good indicator of pricing trends but this metric is influenced by many other factors such as changes in fuel surcharges weight per shipment length of haul and mix of freight therefore changes in revenue per hundredweight do not necessarily indicate actual changes in underlying rates our revenue per hundredweight excluding fuel surcharges increased 71 in 2011 but was positively influenced by the decrease in weight per shipment and an increase in length of haul 

fuel surcharge revenue increased to 164 of revenue from 123 in 2010 due to the increased price of diesel fuel during 2011 most of our tariffs and contracts provide for a fuel surcharge which is recorded as additional revenue as diesel fuel prices increase above stated levels these levels are 

  

generally indexed to the doe’s published fuel prices that reset each week the fuel surcharge is one of many components included in the overall negotiated price for our transportation services with our customers although it is generally considered to be a measure of the increase in cost of all petroleum products we use we regularly monitor the components of our pricing including base freight rates and fuel surcharges we also address any individual account profitability issues with our customers as part of our effort to minimize the negative impact on our profitability that would likely result from a rapid and significant change in any of our operating expenses 

operating costs and other expenses 

salaries wages and benefits increased 1473 million or 182 in 2011 which compares favorably with our revenue growth of 271 as a result our salaries wages and benefits improved to 508 of revenue from 546 in 2010 salaries and wages excluding benefits increased 1099 million due to a 76 increase in the total number of fulltime employees and the impact from salary and wage increases provided to our employees in september 2011 and 2010 in addition there was an increase in performancebased compensation due to the improvement in our financial and operational results these increases were partially offset by the improved productivity of our linehaul pd and platform operations that resulted from increased density and a continued focus on efficiency our linehaul laden load average pd shipments per hour and platform pounds handled per hour improved 03 11 and 01 respectively 

employee benefit costs increased 373 million primarily due to an increase in the number of fulltime employees increased costs related to our group health plan and higher payrollrelated taxes as a percentage of salaries and wages employee benefit costs increased slightly to 319 in 2011 from 315 in 2010 our group health plan requires a 90day waiting period before newly hired employees are eligible to enroll a significant number of employees were hired in the second half 2010 and as a result our group health costs increased as these new employees began to enroll in our plan in 2011 in addition our group health costs increased due to changes required by the 2010 patient protection and affordable care act which required us to provide dependant coverage until the age of 26 

operating supplies and expenses increased to 189 of revenue in 2011 from 165 in 2010 this increase is primarily due to the increase in diesel fuel costs excluding fuel taxes which is the largest component of operating supplies and expenses these costs increased 528 during the year as a result of the combined effect of a 297 increase in our average price per gallon and a 127 increase in gallons consumed the increase in fuel consumption is primarily due to a 147 yearoveryear increase in overall miles driven that was partially offset by an improvement in our average miles per gallon our increased fuel consumption also resulted in an increase in our fuel tax expenses and was the principal driver of the 79 million increase in “operating taxes and licenses” we do not use diesel fuel hedging instruments and are therefore subject to market price fluctuations 

depreciation and amortization expense decreased to 48 of revenue in 2011 as compared to 54 in 2010 although our capital expenditure requirements increased in 2011 we were able to offset the cost of these additions by utilizing the available capacity of our fleet and service center network to create operating leverage on the 131 increase in tonnage our capital expenditure plan for 2012 is projected to be higher than 2011 and as a result our depreciation costs will likely increase in future periods 

we purchase linehaul transportation and pd services from other motor carriers and railroads we also utilize independent contractors for our container operations we utilize these services when it is economically beneficial or when there are imbalances of freight flow within our service center network purchased transportation expense remained consistent at 34 of revenue in 2011 and 2010 as it is typically more efficient and profitable for us to utilize our own personnel and equipment we expect to continue to focus on balancing our internal resources with freight demand in an effort to reduce our use of purchased transportation in future periods 

our effective tax rate for 2011 was 366 as compared to 392 in 2010 our effective tax rates in 2011 and 2010 were favorably impacted by alternative fuel tax credits for the use of propane in our operations these fuel tax credits were originally scheduled to expire on december 31 2009 however they were extended to december 31 2011 with the passage of the tax relief unemployment insurance reauthorization and job creation act of 2010 our 2011 rate also includes the favorable impact of tax credits related to our investment in alternative energyproducing assets 

  

2010 compared to 2009 

key financial and operating metrics for 2010 and 2009 are presented below 

 

 during 2010 we achieved significant increases in our shipments and tonnage which accelerated during the second half of the year we believe these increases were the result of our ability to gain market share during the year as well as general growth in us industrial production and manufacturing as industry capacity tightened in 2010 many of our competitors implemented significant rate increases this reversed an industry trend of several years in which many of our competitors had discounted prices while we implemented a modest general rate increase in november 2010 our pricing philosophy remained consistent with our strategy throughout the recession which was to provide “bestinclass” ontime and claimsfree service at a fair and equitable price 

the significant growth in our tonnage resulted in increased density in our network that generally resulted in increased efficiency and productivity the overall improvement in our pricing during 2010 combined with the increased density resulted in improvements in our operating results net income increased in 2010 by 408 million or 1169 to 757 million and our operating ratio decreased by 360 basis points to 907 our 2010 results also reflect reductions in our depreciation and amortization expenses of approximately 127 million due to changes in the estimated useful lives and salvage values of certain equipment which are described further under “critical accounting policies” below 

revenue 

the 190 increase in revenue during 2010 was the result of increases in tonnage and revenue per hundredweight tonnage increased 154 for the year ended december 31 2010 due to the combination of a 100 increase in shipments and a 49 increase in weight per shipment the growth in tonnage per day and shipments per day accelerated during the second half of the year which we believe reflects our gain in market share as well as general economic improvement we believe the increase in our weight per shipment during this time indicated an improving economy although we also continued to gain market share with large national shippers that typically have heavier shipments 

revenue per hundredweight increased 31 to 1309 from 1270 in 2009 this increase primarily reflects an increase in fuel surcharges which are designed to offset fluctuations in the cost of petroleumbased products and are one of many components included in the overall price for our services excluding fuel surcharges revenue per hundredweight remained consistent between 2010 and 2009 despite the negative effect on this metric from the increase in weight per shipment this consistency reflects our ability to initiate price increases during 2010 as industry conditions improved during the year our ability to obtain price increases strengthened we experienced improvement in the yearoveryear change in revenue per hundredweight excluding fuel surcharges for each month during the second half of 2010 and also implemented a general rate increase on certain of our tariffs effective november 15 2010 

fuel surcharge revenue increased to 123 of revenue from 96 in 2009 as a result of the increased price of diesel fuel during 2010 most of our tariffs and contracts provide for a fuel surcharge which is recorded as additional revenue as diesel fuel prices increase above stated levels these levels are generally indexed to the doe’s published fuel prices that reset each week the fuel surcharge is one 

  

of many components included in the overall negotiated price for our transportation services with our customers although it is generally considered to be a measure of the increase in cost of all petroleum products we use we regularly monitor the components of our pricing including base freight rates and fuel surcharges we also address individual account profitability issues with our customers when necessary as part of our effort to minimize the negative impact on our profitability that would likely result from a rapid and significant change in any of our operating expenses 

operating costs and other expenses 

salaries wages and benefits increased 901 million or 125  in 2010 which compares favorably with our revenue and tonnage growth of 190 and 154 respectively as a result and due to our increased reliance on purchased transportation in 2010 our salaries wages and benefits improved to 546 of revenue from 577 in 2009 salaries and wages increased 761 million due to a 164 increase in the total number of fulltime employees and an increase in the number of hours worked by existing employees which was in direct response to the increase in tonnage during the year in addition we implemented a 2 salary and wage increase for all employees on september 3 2010 

the increased density within our network allowed us to leverage the additional volumes at lower unit costs driver wages as a percentage of revenue improved to 217 from 231 in 2009 and platform wages improved to 66 of revenue from 68 in 2009 the increased density also allowed us to maintain efficient operations although we did not experience improvement in all of our productivity measures due to the costs of hiring and training new employees in our linehaul operations our laden load average increased 15 pd shipments per hour remained consistent with 2009 but our pd stops per hour decreased 07 

we benefited from a decrease in employee benefit costs as a percentage of salaries and wages to 315 in 2010 from 334 in 2009 much of this improvement is attributable to the improvement in our group health and dental costs as a percent of salaries and wages our group health costs were favorably impacted by a decrease in the number of claims paid for participants under the consolidated omnibus budget reconciliation act of 1985 “cobra” and an overall decrease in the average severity of health insurance claims there is also a 90day wait period before newly hired employees are eligible to enroll in our health plan and the majority of the employees hired in 2010 were hired during the second half of the year as a result our group health costs are likely to increase in future periods as these new employees begin to enroll in our plan 

operating supplies and expenses increased to 165 of revenue in 2010 from 146 in 2009 this increase is primarily due to the increase in diesel fuel costs excluding fuel taxes which is the largest component of operating supplies and expenses these costs increased 445 during the year as a result of the combined effect of a 227 increase in our average price per gallon and a 121 increase in gallons consumed the increase in fuel consumption is primarily due to the yearoveryear increase in overall miles our increased consumption also resulted in the increase to our fuel tax expenses and was the principal driver of the 52 million increase in “operating taxes and licenses” we do not use diesel fuel hedging instruments and are therefore subject to market price fluctuations 

depreciation and amortization expense decreased to 54 of revenue in 2010 as compared to 76 in 2009 our capital expenditure requirements were reduced for 2010 due to the available capacity throughout the year in our fleet and service center network the operating leverage created by our reduced capital expenditures and the 154 increase in tonnage contributed to the decrease in depreciation and amortization expense as a percent of revenue the improvement as a percent of revenue also reflects the approximate 127 million decrease in depreciation expense that resulted from changes in the estimated useful lives and salvage values of certain equipment effective january 1 2010 the changes we made are described in more detail under “critical accounting policies” below 

we purchase linehaul transportation and pd services from other motor carriers and railroads we also utilize independent contractors for our container operations we utilize these services when it is economically beneficial or when there are imbalances of freight flow within our service center network purchased transportation expense increased to 34 of revenue in 2010 from 27 in 2009 these costs increased primarily because of certain imbalances of freight flow within our network which is attributable to the significant increase in our tonnage in response to our tonnage growth we increased our fulltime headcount during 2010 the majority of which were drivers and platform employees as we begin to balance our internal resources with freight demand we intend to reduce our use of purchased transportation as it is more efficient and profitable to utilize our own personnel and equipment 

  

our effective tax rate for 2010 was 392 as compared to 390 in 2009 our effective tax rates in 2010 and 2009 were favorably impacted by alternative fuel tax credits for the use of propane in our operations these fuel tax credits were originally scheduled to expire on december 31 2009 however they were extended to december 31 2011 with the passage of the tax relief unemployment insurance reauthorization and job creation act of 2010 in december 2010 our effective tax rate exceeded the federal statutory rate of 35 primarily due to the impact of state taxes and certain nondeductible items 

liquidity and capital resources 

a summary of our cash flows is presented below 

 

 the changes in our cash flows provided by operating activities for the periods presented above are due primarily to the significant improvement in our results of operations which are described above in item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations – results of operations ” changes in cash flows used in investing activities are primarily due to a significant increase in our capital expenditures for 2011 following a reduction of capital outlays during the uncertain economic environment in 2010 these changes in our capital expenditure program are more fully described in item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations – capital expenditures” changes in cash flows provided by or used in financing activities consist of fluctuations in our senior unsecured revolving line of credit scheduled principal payments and debt and equity issuances during 2011 in january 2011 we completed a 950 million private placement of senior notes and in march 2011 we received net proceeds of 484 million resulting from the issuance of our common stock as discussed in more detail below a portion of the proceeds from these transactions was used to satisfy the outstanding balance on our senior unsecured revolving line of credit please refer to the statements of cash flows included in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” of this report for additional information regarding the changes in our cash and cash equivalents 

we have three primary sources of available liquidity cash and cash equivalents cash flows from operations and available borrowings under our senior unsecured revolving credit agreement which is described below we believe we also have sufficient access to debt and equity markets to provide another source of liquidity if needed 

on january 3 2011 we entered into a note purchase agreement pursuant to which we issued 950 million of privatelyplaced senior notes we entered into this note purchase agreement to fund planned capital expenditures and for general corporate purposes we used a portion of the proceeds to refinance existing indebtedness including paying down the outstanding balance on our senior unsecured revolving credit agreement 

to facilitate our access to the equity market we filed an automatic shelf registration statement with the securities and exchange commission the “sec” during the fourth quarter of 2009 that provides us with the opportunity to offer and sell shares of common stock on a delayed or continuous basis at indeterminate prices from time to time pursuant to this automatic shelf registration we filed a prospectus supplement and entered into an atthemarket equity offering sales agreement on february 2 2011 with stifel nicolaus  company incorporated “stifel nicolaus weisel” pursuant to which we had the ability to issue and sell from time to time over a 12month period through or to stifel nicolaus weisel 

  

shares of our common stock having an aggregate offering price of up to 1000 million the “atm program” from february 2 2011 through december 31 2011 we issued 1516379 shares of common stock at an average price of 3269 per share pursuant to the atm program for aggregate gross proceeds of 496 million and aggregate net proceeds of 484 million after deducting commissions and other transaction costs of 12 million there were no subsequent issuances pursuant to the atm program through february 2 2012 which was the date on which the atm program expired 

capital expenditures 

the table below sets forth our net capital expenditures for property and equipment including those obtained through capital leases for the years ended december 31 2011 2010 and 2009 

 

 our capital expenditure requirements are generally based upon the projected increase in the number and size of service center facilities to support our plan for longterm growth our planned tractor and trailer replacement cycle and forecasted revenue growth our capital expenditures for tractors and trailers increased in 2011 as we needed equipment for anticipated growth as well as to replace equipment being retired through our normal replacement cycle in comparison we made use of available equipment capacity in 2010 and 2009 and were able to limit our purchases of these assets the increase in our expenditures for other assets increased in 2011 due to increased purchases of forklifts yard tractors and alternative energyproducing assets 

we currently estimate that capital expenditures net of anticipated proceeds from dispositions will be approximately 300 million to 350 million for the year ending december 31 2012 of our capital expenditures approximately 90 million to 120 million is allocated for the purchase of service center facilities construction of new service center facilities or expansion of existing service center facilities approximately 195 million to 210 million is allocated for the purchase of tractors trailers and other equipment and approximately 15 million to 20 million is allocated for investments in technology we expect to fund these capital expenditures through cash flows from operations our existing cash and cash equivalents and the use of our senior unsecured revolving credit facility we believe our current sources of liquidity will be sufficient to satisfy our expected capital expenditures 

we anticipate that there will be additional environmental regulations and legislation resulting from the increased regulatory focus on climate change and greenhouse gas emissions in the united states at this time we cannot predict the requirements of any future regulations however any limitations on the emission of greenhouse gases or other environmental legislation could increase our future capital expenditures and have an adverse impact on our financial condition results of operations and liquidity 

financing agreements 

we entered into a fiveyear 2000 million senior unsecured revolving credit facility pursuant to the terms of a second amended and restated credit agreement on august 10 2011 the “credit agreement” with wells fargo bank national association “wells fargo” serving as administrative agent for the lenders this credit agreement amended and restated the terms of the previous 2250 million amended and restated senior unsecured revolving credit facility dated august 10 2006 of the 2000 million line of credit commitments 1500 million may be used for letters of credit and 200 million may be used for borrowings under the wells fargo sweep plus loan program we utilize the sweep program to manage our daily cash needs as the sweep program automatically initiates borrowings to cover overnight cash requirements up to an aggregate of 200 million in addition we have the right to request an increase in the line of credit commitments up to a total of 3000 million in minimum increments of 250 million 

  

at our option revolving loans under the facility bear interest at either a the applicable margin percentage for base rate loans plus the higher of wells fargo’s prime rate the federal funds rate plus 05 per annum or the one month libor rate plus 10 per annum b the libor rate plus the applicable margin percentage for libor loans or c the libor market index rate “libor index rate” plus the applicable margin percentage for libor market index loans the applicable margin percentage is determined by a pricing grid in the credit agreement and ranges from 10 to 1875 the applicable margin percentage was 1125 for the period this credit agreement was in effect during 2011 revolving loans under the sweep program bear interest at the libor index rate 

the credit agreement contains customary covenants including financial covenants that require us to observe a maximum ratio of debt to total capital and a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio any future whollyowned subsidiaries of old dominion would be required to guarantee payment of all of our obligations under the facility the amounts outstanding and remaining borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facilities are presented below 

 

 commitment fees ranging from 0175 to 030 are charged quarterly in arrears on the aggregate unutilized portion of the credit agreement letter of credit fees equal to the applicable margin for adjusted libor rate loans are charged quarterly in arrears on the daily average aggregate stated amount of all letters of credit outstanding during the quarter the commitment fees and letter of credit fees were 020 and 1125 respectively for the period the credit agreement was in effect during 2011 in addition a facing fee at an annual rate of 0125 is charged quarterly in arrears on the daily average aggregate stated amount of all letters of credit outstanding during such quarter 

we have three outstanding unsecured senior note agreements with an aggregate amount outstanding of 2629 million at december 31 2011 these notes call for periodic principal payments with maturities that range from 2015 to 2021 of which 357 million is due in the next twelve months interest rates on these notes are fixed and range from 400 to 585 the effective average interest rate on our outstanding senior note agreements was 517 and 554 at december 31 2011 and 2010 respectively 

with the exception of borrowings pursuant to the credit agreement interest rates are fixed on all of our debt instruments therefore shortterm exposure to fluctuations in interest rates is limited to our line of credit facility we do not currently use interest rate derivative instruments to manage exposure to interest rate changes 

our credit agreement limits the amount of dividends that could be paid to shareholders to the greater of i 200 million ii the amount of dividends paid in the immediately preceding fiscal year or iii an amount equal to 25 of net income from the immediately preceding fiscal year we did not declare or pay a dividend on our common stock in 2011 or 2010 and we have no plans to declare or pay a dividend in 2012 

a significant decrease in demand for our services could limit our ability to generate cash flow and affect profitability most of our debt agreements have covenants that require stated levels of financial performance which if not achieved could cause acceleration of the payment schedules as of december 31 2011 we were in compliance with these covenants we do not anticipate a significant decline in business levels or financial performance that would cause us to violate any such covenants in the future and we believe the combination of our existing credit agreement along with our additional borrowing capacity will be sufficient to meet foreseeable seasonal and longterm capital needs 

  

common stock split 

on july 30 2010 our board of directors approved a threefortwo common stock split for shareholders of record as of the close of business on august 9 2010 on august 23 2010 those shareholders received one additional share of common stock for every two shares owned in lieu of fractional shares shareholders received a cash payment based on the average of the high and low sales prices of the common stock on the record date 

all references in this report to shares outstanding weighted average shares outstanding and earnings per share amounts have been restated retroactively to reflect this stock split 

contractual obligations 

the following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations as of december 31 2011 

 

  

 critical accounting policies 

in preparing our financial statements we apply the following critical accounting policies that we believe affect our judgments and estimates of amounts recorded in certain assets liabilities revenue and expenses these critical accounting policies are further described in note 1 of the notes to the financial statements included in item 8 of this report 

revenue recognition 

we recognize revenue based upon when our transportation services have been completed in accordance with the bill of lading contract our general tariff provisions or contractual agreements with our customers generally this occurs when we complete the delivery of a shipment for transportation services not completed at the end of a reporting period we use a percentage of completion method to allocate the appropriate revenue to each separate reporting period under this method we develop a factor for each uncompleted shipment by dividing the actual number of days in transit at the end of a reporting period by that shipment’s standard delivery time schedule this factor is applied to the total revenue for that shipment and revenue is allocated between reporting periods accordingly 

allowances for uncollectible accounts and revenue adjustments 

we maintain an allowance for uncollectible accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments we estimate this allowance by analyzing the aging of our customer receivables our historical loss experience and other trends and factors affecting the credit risk 

  

of our customers we determine customer receivables to be past due when payment has not been received by the invoice due date writeoffs occur when we determine an account to be uncollectible and could differ from our allowance estimate as a result of factors such as changes in the overall economic environment or risks surrounding our customers additional allowances may be required if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments we periodically review the underlying assumptions in our estimate of the allowance for uncollectible accounts to ensure that the allowance reflects the most recent trends and factors 

we also maintain an allowance for estimated revenue adjustments resulting from future billing corrections customer allowances moneyback service guarantees and other miscellaneous revenue adjustments these revenue adjustments are recorded in our revenue from operations we use historical experience trends and current information to update and evaluate these estimates 

management believes the methodologies for estimating these allowances to be reliable based on the accuracy of our estimates in prior periods as such we do not anticipate any nearterm changes in our methodologies for these estimates 

claims and insurance accruals 

claims and insurance accruals reflect the estimated cost of claims for cargo loss and damage bipd workers’ compensation longterm disability group health and dental not covered by insurance the related costs are charged to insurance and claims expense except for workers’ compensation longterm disability group health and dental which are charged to employee benefits expense 

insurers providing excess coverage above retention levels adjust their premiums to cover insured losses and for other market factors as a result we periodically evaluate our selfinsured retention levels to determine the most costefficient balance between selfinsurance and excess coverage 

in establishing accruals for claims and insurance expenses we evaluate and monitor each claim individually and we use factors such as historical claims development experience known trends and thirdparty estimates to determine the appropriate reserves for potential liability we believe the assumptions and methods used to estimate these liabilities are reasonable however any changes in the severity of previouslyreported claims significant changes in the medical costs and regulatory changes affecting the administration of our plans could significantly impact the determination of appropriate reserves in future periods 

property and equipment 

property and equipment are recorded at cost and depreciated on a straightline basis over their estimated economic lives management uses historical experience certain assumptions and estimates in determining the economic life of each asset periodically we review property and equipment for impairment due to changes in operational and market conditions and we adjust the carrying value and economic life of any impaired asset as appropriate 

effective january 1 2010 estimated economic lives for structures are 7 to 30 years revenue equipment is 4 to 15 years other equipment is 2 to 20 years and leasehold improvements are the lesser of the economic life of the leasehold improvement or the remaining life of the lease the use of different assumptions estimates or significant changes in the resale market for our equipment could result in material changes in the carrying value and related depreciation of our assets 

during the first quarter of 2010 we completed an evaluation of the estimated useful lives and salvage values for our equipment and determined that the actual period of service of certain revenue equipment exceeded that of our previously estimated useful lives as a result we extended the estimated useful lives of most of our tractors to 9 years from 7 years and extended the estimated useful lives of our trailers to 15 years from 12 years in addition we reduced the estimated salvage values associated with this equipment to more accurately reflect the value we believe such equipment will have at the end of its respective useful life we made similar changes to the estimated useful lives and salvage values for certain of our other equipment but the results of these changes had less of an impact on our future depreciation expense as a result of the impact on depreciation from these changes that were effective january 1 2010 income from continuing operations and net income in 2010 increased by approximately 127 million and 77 million respectively 

  

inflation 

most of our expenses are affected by inflation which typically results in increased operating costs in response to fluctuations in the cost of petroleum products particularly diesel fuel we generally include a fuel surcharge in our tariffs and contractual agreements the fuel surcharge is designed to offset the cost of diesel fuel above a base price and increases as diesel fuel prices escalate over the base which is generally indexed to the doe’s published fuel prices that reset each week volatility in the price of diesel fuel independent of inflation has impacted our business as described in this report however we do not believe inflation has had a material effect on our results of operations for each of the past three years 

related person transactions 

family relationships 

each of earl e congdon john r congdon david s congdon and john r congdon jr are related to one another and served in various executive management positions andor on our board of directors during 2011 we have entered into amended and restated employment agreements with earl e congdon john r congdon and david s congdon which are incorporated by reference as exhibits to our annual report on form 10k we regularly disclose the amount of compensation that we pay to these individuals in the proxy statement for our annual meeting of shareholders 

transactions with old dominion truck leasing inc 

old dominion truck leasing inc “leasing” is a north carolina corporation whose voting stock is owned by an earl e congdon revocable trust the john r congdon revocable trust and members of earl e congdon’s and john r congdon’s families leasing is primarily engaged in the business of purchasing and leasing tractors trailers and other vehicles john r congdon is chairman of the board of leasing and earl e congdon is vice chairman of the board of leasing since 1986 we have combined our requirements with leasing for the purchase of tractors trailers equipment parts tires and fuel we believe that the termination of this arrangement would not have a material adverse impact on our financial results 

we purchased 278000 242000 and 231000 of maintenance and other services from leasing in 2011 2010 and 2009 respectively we believe that the prices we pay for such services are no more than what would be charged by unaffiliated third parties for the same quality of work and we intend to continue to purchase maintenance and other services from leasing provided that leasing’s prices continue to be favorable to us 

we also paid leasing 86000 and 114000 for leased equipment in 2010 and 2009 respectively these payments were for longterm leases for tractors used in our linehaul operations we received no commission or other financial benefit from leasing or any other party in connection with these lease transactions we did not lease any equipment from leasing in 2011 

we charged leasing 18000 17000 and 12000 for the rental of property in 2011 2010 and 2009 respectively no other services were provided to leasing for the years ended december 31 2011 2010 and 2009 

split dollar life insurance policies 

we are the owner of two splitdollar life insurance contracts insuring the life of john r congdon the net cash surrender value for these policies was 66 million and 63 million at december 31 2011 and 2010 respectively and is included on our balance sheets under the caption “other assets” at december 31 2011 these policies provided for an aggregate of 87 million in net death benefits due to the company of which we have endorsed 20 million to mr congdon’s children 

  

audit committee approval 

the audit committee of our board of directors reviewed and approved all of the related person transactions described above in accordance with our related person transactions policy 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact our financial position results of operations and cash flows due to adverse changes in financial market prices and rates 

we are exposed to interest rate risk directly related to loans if any under our credit agreement which have variable interest rates a 100 basis point increase in the average interest rate on this agreement would have no material effect on our operating results we have established policies and procedures to manage exposure to market risks and use major institutions that we believe are creditworthy to minimize credit risk 

we are exposed to market risk for equity investments relating to companyowned life insurance contracts on certain employees at december 31 2011 the cash value for variable life insurance contracts was 172 million of the 276 million of aggregate cash values for all life insurance contracts included on our balance sheets variable life insurance contracts expose us to fluctuations in equity markets however we utilize a thirdparty to manage these assets and minimize that exposure a 10 change in market value in those investments would have a 17 million impact on our operating income 

we are exposed to market risk for awards granted under the old dominion freight line inc phantom stock plan and the old dominion freight line inc director phantom stock plan the liability for the unsettled outstanding awards is remeasured at the end of each reporting period based on the closing price of our common stock at that date at december 31 2011 the total liability for awards granted under the old dominion freight line inc phantom stock plan and the old dominion freight line inc director phantom stock plan totaled 109 million a 10 change in the price of our common stock at december 31 2011 would have had a 11 million impact on our operating income in 2011 with respect to these plans 

we are also exposed to commodity price risk related to diesel fuel prices and manage our exposure to that risk primarily through the application of fuel surcharges 

for further discussion related to these risks see note 2 to the financial statements included in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” and item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations”

overview 

old dominion is a leading lessthantruckload “ltl” nonunion motor carrier providing regional interregional and national ltl service and valueadded logistics services we are the seventh largest ltl motor carrier in the united states as measured by 2009 revenue according to transport topics  in addition to our core ltl services we offer our customers a broad range of logistics services including ground and air expedited transportation supply chain consulting transportation management truckload brokerage container delivery and warehousing services through marketing and carrier relationships we also offer doortodoor international freight services to and from all of north america central america south america and the far east our services are complemented by our technological capabilities which we believe provide the tools to improve the efficiency of our operations while empowering our customers to manage their shipping needs 

we have grown our revenue and customer base through both organic growth and strategic acquisitions and now provide our domestic ltl services throughout the entire continental united states our infrastructure allows us to provide nextday and secondday service within each of our six regions as well as interregional and national service between these regions to support our ongoing expansion we have added 59 new service centers in the past five years for a total of 213 at december 31 2010 

we believe our growth can be attributed to our focus on meeting our customers’ complete supply chain needs from a single point of contact with a high level of customer service supported by ongoing investment in our employees service center network and technology our integrated structure allows us to offer our customers consistent service from origin to destination we believe our operating structure and proprietary information systems enable us to provide higher customer service levels and better manage our operating costs 

we were organized in 1934 and incorporated in virginia in 1950 our principal executive offices are located at 500 old dominion way thomasville north carolina 27360 please refer to the balance sheets and statements of operations included in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” of this report for information regarding our total assets revenue from operations and net income 

  

our industry 

trucking companies provide transportation services to virtually every industry operating in the united states and generally offer higher levels of reliability and faster transit times than other surface transportation options the trucking industry is comprised principally of two types of motor carriers ltl and truckload ltl carriers typically pick up multiple shipments from multiple customers on a single truck and then route that freight for delivery through service centers where the freight may be transferred to other trucks with similar destinations in contrast truckload carriers generally dedicate an entire trailer to one customer from origin to destination 

according to the american trucking associations total domestic freight revenue in 2009 was 6647 billion of which the trucking industry accounted for 819 the ltl sector had revenue in 2009 of 386 billion which represented 58 of total domestic freight revenue in contrast to truckload carriers ltl motor carriers require expansive networks of local pickup and delivery “pd” service centers as well as larger breakbulk or hub facilities significant capital is required of ltl motor carriers to create and maintain a network of service centers and a fleet of tractors and trailers the high fixed costs and capital spending requirements for ltl motor carriers makes it difficult for new startup or small operators to effectively compete with established companies in addition successful ltl motor carriers generally employ and continuously update a high level of technology to provide information to customers and to reduce operating costs 

the ltl industry is highly competitive on the basis of service and price and has consolidated significantly since the industry was deregulated in 1980 based on 2009 revenue the top 25 ltl motor carriers accounted for approximately 65 of the total ltl market consolidation has accelerated in recent years due to an increase in customer demand for single transportation providers offering both national and regional ltl service and complex supply chain services smaller regional carriers with lesser financial resources are generally unable to meet this demand we believe consolidation will continue particularly due to the negative impact on industry fundamentals from the recent recessionary economic environment which appears to have substantially weakened the financial condition of many of our competitors 

competition 

we compete with regional interregional and national ltl carriers and to a lesser extent with truckload carriers small package carriers airfreight carriers and railroads competition is based primarily on service price and business relationships we believe that we are able to compete effectively in our markets by providing highquality and timely service at competitive prices 

at all levels of our organization we seek to continuously improve customer service by maximizing ontime performance while reducing transit times and minimizing cargo claims we believe our transit times are generally faster than those of our principal national competitors in part because of our more efficient service center network use of team drivers and proprietary technology in addition we provide greater geographic coverage than most of our regional competitors our diversified mix and scope of regional interregional and national service enables us to provide our customers with a single source to meet their ltl shipping needs and we believe this provides us with a distinct advantage over our regional multiregional and national competition 

we also believe our nonunion workforce gives us a significant advantage over our unionized ltl competitors by utilizing flexible scheduling and training our employees to perform multiple tasks we believe we achieve greater productivity and higher levels of customer service we believe our focus on employee communication continued education development and motivation strengthens the relationships among our employees 

we compete with several larger transportation service providers each of which may have more equipment a broader coverage network and a wider range of services than we have our larger competitors may also have greater financial resources and in general the ability to reduce prices to gain business especially during times of reduced growth rates in the economy 

  

service center operations 

at december 31 2010 we conducted operations through 213 service center locations of which we owned 132 and leased 81 we operate ten major breakbulk facilities in rialto california atlanta georgia chicago illinois indianapolis indiana greensboro north carolina harrisburg pennsylvania memphis and morristown tennessee dallas texas and salt lake city utah while using other service centers for limited breakbulk activity in order to serve our nextday markets our service centers are strategically located in six regions of the country to provide the highest quality service and minimize freight rehandling costs 

each of our service centers is responsible for the pickup and delivery of freight within its service area each service center loads outbound freight by destination the day it is picked up all inbound freight received by the service center in the evening or during the night is scheduled for local delivery the next business day unless a customer requests a different delivery schedule our management reviews the productivity and service performance of each service center on a daily basis to ensure quality service and efficient operations 

while we have established primary responsibility for customer service at the local service center level our customers may access information and initiate transactions through our centralized customer service department located at our corporate office or through several other gateways such as our website electronic data interchange “edi” automated voice response systems and automated fax systems our systems offer direct access to information such as freight tracking shipping documents rate quotes rate databases and account activity these centralized systems and our customer service department provide our customers with a single point of contact to access information across all areas of our operations and for each of our service products 

linehaul transportation 

linehaul dispatchers are centralized at our corporate office and control the movement of freight among service centers through integrated freight movement systems we also utilize loadplanning software to optimize efficiencies in our linehaul operations our senior management regularly monitors freight movements transit times load factors and other productivity measurements to ensure that we maintain our highest levels of service and efficiency 

we utilize scheduled routes and additional linehaul dispatches as necessary to meet our published service standards in addition we lower our cost structure by maintaining flexible workforce rules and by primarily using twin 28foot trailers in our linehaul operations the use of twin 28foot trailers permits us to transport freight directly from its point of origin to destination with minimal unloading and reloading which also reduces cargo loss and damage expenses we also utilize longcombination vehicles such as triple 28foot trailers and combinations of 48foot and 28foot trailers in states where permitted twin trailers and longcombination vehicles permit more freight to be hauled behind a tractor than could otherwise be hauled by one large trailer 

tractors trailers and maintenance 

at december 31 2010 we owned 5718 tractors we generally use new tractors in linehaul operations for approximately three to five years and then transfer those tractors to pd operations for the remainder of their useful lives in many of our service centers tractors perform pd functions during the day and linehaul functions at night to maximize tractor utilization 

at december 31 2010 we owned 20986 trailers we primarily purchase new trailers for our operations however we occasionally purchase preowned equipment that meets our specifications 

  

at various times we have also acquired tractors and trailers through our acquisition of business assets from other carriers the purchase of preowned equipment can provide an excellent value but also can increase our fleet’s average age the table below reflects as of december 31 2010 the average age of our tractors trucks and trailers 

 

 we develop certain specifications for tractors and trailers and then negotiate the production and purchase of this equipment with several manufacturers these purchases are planned well in advance of anticipated delivery dates in order to accommodate manufacturers’ production schedules we believe that there is sufficient capacity among suppliers to ensure an uninterrupted supply of equipment to support our operations 

the table below sets forth our capital expenditures for tractors and trailers for the years ended december 31 2010 2009 and 2008 our capital expenditures for tractors and trailers for the past three years were limited to replacing a portion of the equipment scheduled to be retired through the normal replacement cycle we retained much of the equipment scheduled for replacement however to provide sufficient capacity for us to take advantage of any increase in demand for our services caused by improvements in the economy and potential business failures or consolidation in the ltl industry due to our anticipated growth and our planned efforts to reduce the average age of our fleet in 2011 our equipment purchases in 2011 are expected to be significantly higher than in recent years 

 

 at december 31 2010 we had major maintenance operations at our service centers in rialto california denver colorado atlanta georgia indianapolis indiana kansas city and parsons kansas greensboro north carolina columbus ohio harrisburg pennsylvania morristown and memphis tennessee dallas texas and salt lake city utah in addition 19 other service center locations are equipped to perform routine and preventive maintenance and repairs on our equipment 

we adhere to established maintenance policies and procedures to help ensure our fleet is properly maintained linehaul tractors are routed to appropriate maintenance facilities at designated mileage or time intervals depending upon how the equipment has been utilized pd tractors and trailers are scheduled for maintenance every 90 days 

marketing and customers 

at december 31 2010 we had a sales staff of 487 employees we compensate our sales force in part based upon ontime service performance revenue generated and company and service center profitability which we believe helps motivate our sales employees to achieve our service growth and profitability objectives 

we utilize a computerized freightcosting model to determine the price level at which a particular shipment of freight will be profitable we can modify elements of this freightcosting model to simulate the actual conditions under which the freight will be moved we also compete for business by participating in bid solicitations customers generally solicit bids for relatively large numbers of shipments for a period of one to two years and typically choose to enter into contractual arrangements with a limited number of motor carriers based upon price and service 

  

revenue is generated by customers dispersed primarily throughout the united states and north america in 2010 our largest customer accounted for approximately 28 of our revenue and our largest 5 10 and 20 customers accounted for approximately 91 139 and 208 of our revenue respectively for each of the previous three years at least 90 of our revenue was derived from transporting ltl shipments for our customers and less than 5 of our revenue was generated from international services we believe the diversity of our customer base helps protect our business from adverse developments in a single geographic region and the reduction or loss of business from a single customer 

seasonality 

our operations are subject to seasonal trends common in the trucking industry our operating margins in the first quarter are normally lower due to reduced demand during the winter months harsh weather can also adversely affect our performance by reducing demand and reducing our ability to transport freight which could result in decreased revenue and increased operating expenses 

technology 

we continually upgrade our technological capabilities and we provide access to our systems through multiple gateways that offer our customers maximum flexibility and immediate access to information we employ vehicle safety systems freight handling systems and logistics technology to reduce costs and transit times we continue to focus on the development and enhancement of the technology used in our operations in order to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of our services 

insurance 

we carry a significant amount of insurance with thirdparty insurance carriers but we are exposed to the risk of loss on claims up to the limit for which we are selfinsured we are currently selfinsured for bodily injury and property damage “bipd” claims up to 275 million per occurrence cargo loss and damage claims are selfinsured up to 100000 per occurrence we are exposed to workers’ compensation claims up to 10 million per occurrence through either selfinsurance or insurance deductibles we are selfinsured for group health claims up to 375000 per occurrence plus an aggregate 200000 over this retention level our longterm disability claims are selfinsured to a maximum of 3000 per month for each of our nonsalaried employees effective april 2 2010 salaried employees were offered an elective longterm disability plan and as a result the company has no liability for new claims occurring subsequent to this date for its salaried employees 

we believe that our policy of selfinsuring a portion of our risks together with our safety and loss prevention programs is an effective means of managing insurance costs we also believe that our current insurance coverage is adequate to cover our liability risks 

diesel fuel availability and cost 

our industry depends heavily upon the availability of diesel fuel although we maintained fuel storage and pumping facilities at 45 or 21 of our service center locations at december 31 2010 we may experience shortages at certain locations and may be forced to incur additional expense to ensure adequate supply on a timely basis to prevent a disruption to our service schedules we implemented a fuel surcharge program in august 1999 the program has remained in effect since that time and is one of many components that we use to determine the overall price for our transportation services our fuel surcharges are generally indexed to fuel prices published by the us department of energy the “doe” that reset each week our management believes that our operations and financial condition are susceptible to the same diesel fuel price increases or shortages as those of our competitors diesel fuel costs including fuel taxes totaled 131 and 114 of revenue in 2010 and 2009 respectively 

  

employees 

as of december 31 2010 we employed 11179 individuals on a fulltime basis none of which were represented under a collective bargaining agreement our fulltime employees work in the following roles 

 

 as of december 31 2010 we employed 3002 linehaul drivers and 2928 pd drivers on a fulltime basis each of our drivers is required to pass a drug test and have a current us department of transportation “dot” physical and a valid commercial driver’s license prior to employment once employed drivers are required to obtain and maintain hazardous materials endorsements to their commercial driver’s licenses drivers as well as all employees are required to take preemployment drug and alcohol tests and are randomly selected for periodic additional testing 

to help fulfill driver needs we offer qualified employees the opportunity to become drivers through the “old dominion driver training program” since its inception in 1988 2738 individuals have graduated from this program of the program graduates we have experienced an annual turnover rate of approximately 74 which is below our companywide average turnover rate of approximately 123 for drivers we believe our driver training and qualification programs have been important factors in improving our safety record and retaining our qualified drivers drivers with safe driving records are rewarded with bonuses of up to 3000 payable each year driver safety bonuses paid during 2010 and 2009 were 21 million and 20 million respectively 

governmental regulation 

we are subject to regulation by the federal motor carrier safety administration the “fmcsa” the pipeline and hazardous materials safety agency and the surface transportation board which are agencies within the dot as well as the regulations of various state agencies these regulatory authorities have broad powers generally governing matters such as authority to engage in motor carrier operations motor carrier registration driver hours of service safety and fitness of transportation equipment and drivers certain mergers consolidations and acquisitions and periodic financial reporting in addition we are subject to compliance with cargosecurity and transportation regulations issued by the transportation security administration within the us department of homeland security 

the trucking industry is subject to regulatory and legislative changes from a variety of other governmental authorities which address matters such as i increasingly stringent environmental and occupational safety and health regulations ii limits on vehicle weight and size iii ergonomics and iv hours of service these changes may affect our business or the economics of our industry by requiring changes in operating practices or by influencing the demand for and increasing the costs of providing our services 

the cost of compliance with current applicable laws and regulations has not materially impacted our results of operations or financial condition however future changes to laws or regulations including proposed changes to hours of service may adversely affect our operations and could result in unforeseen costs to our business 

environmental regulation 

we are subject to various federal state and local environmental laws and regulations that focus on among other things the emission and discharge of hazardous materials into the environment or their presence on or in our properties and vehicles fuel storage tanks transportation of certain materials and the discharge or retention of storm water under specific environmental laws we could also be held responsible for any costs relating to contamination at our past or present facilities and at thirdparty waste 

  

disposal sites as well as costs associated with cleanup of accidents involving our vehicles we do not believe that the cost of future compliance with current environmental laws or regulations will have a material adverse effect on our operations financial condition competitive position or capital expenditures for the remainder of fiscal year 2011 or fiscal year 2012 however future changes to laws or regulations may adversely affect our operations and could result in unforeseen costs to our business

tablestart 


 item 1a risk factors tableend various factors exist that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those projected in any forwardlooking statement in addition to the factors discussed elsewhere in this report we believe the following are some of the important risks and uncertainties that could materially affect our business financial condition or results of operations 

we operate in a highly competitive industry and our business will suffer if we are unable to adequately address potential downward pricing pressures and other factors that may adversely affect our operations and profitability 

numerous competitive factors could impair our ability to maintain our current profitability these factors include but are not limited to the following 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 if we are unable to effectively compete with other ltl carriers whether on the basis of pricing service or otherwise we may be unable to retain existing customers or attract new customers either of which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

  

if our employees were to unionize our operating costs would increase and our ability to compete would be impaired 

none of our employees are currently represented under a collective bargaining agreement however from time to time there have been efforts to organize our employees at various service centers further congress or one or more states could approve legislation significantly affecting our business and our relationship with our employees such as the proposed federal legislation referred to as the employee free choice act which would substantially liberalize the procedures for union organization in addition we can offer no assurance that the department of labor will not adopt new regulations or interpret existing regulations in a manner that would favor the agenda of unions or that our employees will not unionize in the future particularly if regulatory changes occur that facilitate unionization 

the unionization of our employees could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations because 

 

  

  

  

  

 if we are unable to successfully execute our growth strategy our business and future results of operations may suffer 

our growth strategy includes increasing the volume of freight moving through our existing service center network selectively expanding our geographic footprint and broadening the scope of our service offerings in connection with our growth strategy at various times we have made selective acquisitions purchased additional equipment expanded and upgraded service centers and increased our sales and marketing efforts and we expect to continue to do so our growth strategy exposes us to a number of risks including the following 

 

  

  

  

  

 we cannot assure that we will overcome the risks associated with our growth strategy if we fail to overcome those risks we may not realize additional revenue or profits from our efforts we may incur additional expenses and therefore our financial position and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 

we may be unable to successfully consummate and integrate acquisitions as part of our growth strategy 

growth through acquisitions has been a key component of our ltl growth strategy throughout our history in the future we may seek to acquire other ltl carriers as well as other complementary businesses exploration of potential acquisitions requires significant attention from our senior management team in addition we expect to compete for acquisition opportunities with other companies some of which may have greater financial and other resources than we do we cannot assure that we will 

  

have sufficient cash with which to consummate an acquisition or otherwise be able to obtain financing for any acquisition if we are unable to access sufficient funding for potential acquisitions we may not be able to complete transactions that we otherwise find advantageous 

any subsequent acquisition will entail numerous risks including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 in addition we may have difficulty in integrating any acquired business and its operations services and personnel into our existing operations and such integration may require a significant amount of time and effort by our management team to the extent we do not successfully avoid or overcome the risks or problems resulting from any acquisitions we undertake there could be a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our customers’ and suppliers’ business may be impacted by a downturn in the economy andor a disruption of financial markets 

adverse economic conditions can negatively affect our customers’ business levels the amount of transportation services they need their ability to pay for our services and overall freight levels all of which might impair our asset utilization customers encountering adverse economic conditions may be unable to obtain additional financing or financing under acceptable terms due to disruptions in the capital and credit markets these customers represent a greater potential for bad debt losses which may require us to increase our reserve for bad debt economic conditions resulting in bankruptcies of one or more of our large customers could have a significant impact on our financial position results of operations or liquidity in a particular year or quarter further when adverse economic times arise customers may bid out freight or select competitors that offer lower rates from among existing choices in an attempt to lower their costs and we might be forced to lower our rates or lose freight 

our suppliers’ business levels also may be negatively affected by adverse economic conditions or financial constraints which could lead to disruptions in the supply and availability of equipment parts and services critical to our operations a significant interruption in our normal supply chain could disrupt our operations increase our costs and negatively impact our ability to serve our customers 

we also are subject to cost increases outside our control that could materially reduce our profitability if we are unable to increase our rates sufficiently such cost increases include but are not limited to increases in fuel prices driver wages interest rates taxes tolls license and registration fees insurance revenue equipment and healthcare for our employees 

increases in driver compensation or other difficulties attracting and retaining qualified drivers could adversely affect our profitability and ability to maintain or grow our fleet 

from time to time we have experienced difficulty in attracting and retaining sufficient numbers of qualified drivers and such shortages may recur in the future because of the intense competition for drivers we may face difficulty maintaining or increasing our number of drivers the compensation we offer our drivers is subject to market conditions that may require increases in driver compensation which will be more likely to the extent that economic conditions improve if we are unable to continue to attract and 

  

retain a sufficient number of drivers we could be required to adjust our compensation packages or operate with fewer trucks and face difficulty meeting shipper demands all of which could adversely affect our profitability and ability to maintain our size or grow 

insurance and claims expenses could significantly reduce our profitability 

we are exposed to claims related to cargo loss and damage property damage personal injury workers’ compensation longterm disability group health and dental we have insurance coverage with thirdparty insurance carriers but selfinsure for a significant portion of the risk associated with these claims our operating results would be adversely affected if any of the following were to occur i the number or severity of claims for which we are selfinsured increases ii we are required to accrue or pay additional amounts because the claims prove to be more severe than our original assessment or iii claims exceed our excess coverage amounts if claims exceed our retention levels or insurance market conditions change insurers could raise premiums for excess coverage to cover their expenses and anticipated future losses in addition insurance companies require us to obtain letters of credit to collateralize our selfinsured retention if these requirements increase our borrowing capacity could be adversely affected 

we have significant ongoing cash requirements that could limit our growth and affect our profitability if we are unable to obtain sufficient capital 

our business is highly capital intensive we generally finance our capital expenditures and planned growth with existing cash cash flow from operations issuance of senior notes and through available borrowings under our existing senior unsecured credit agreement we may require additional capital to finance longterm real estate purchase opportunities and acquisitions which we may fund through additional debt or through equity offerings if we are unable in the future to generate sufficient cash from our operations or raise capital by accessing the debt and equity markets we may be forced to limit our growth and operate our equipment for longer periods of time which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results 

our business also has significant ongoing operating cash requirements if our cash requirements are high or our cash flow from operations is low during particular periods we may need to seek additional financing which may be costly or difficult to obtain 

limited supply and increased prices for new equipment may adversely affect our earnings and cash flow 

investment in new equipment is a significant part of our annual capital expenditures and we require an available supply of tractors and trailers from equipment manufacturers to operate and grow our business we may face difficulty in purchasing new equipment due to decreased supply we have experienced higher prices for new tractors over the past few years the price of our equipment may also be adversely affected in the future by regulations on newly manufactured tractors and diesel engines for example the us environmental protection agency the “epa” has issued regulations that require progressive reductions in exhaust emissions from diesel engines through 2010 beginning in october 2002 new diesel engines were required to meet these new emission limits some of the regulations required reductions in the sulfur content of diesel fuel beginning in june 2006 and the introduction of emissions aftertreatment devices on newlymanufactured engines and vehicles beginning with modelyear 2007 the final phase of the regulations requires reduced nitrogen and nonmethane hydrocarbon emissions beginning with modelyear 2010 these regulations have resulted in higher prices for tractors and diesel engines and increased fuel diesel exhaust fluid and maintenance costs and there can be no assurance that continued increases in pricing or costs will not have an adverse effect on our business and operations 

a decrease in the demand and value of used equipment may impact our results of operations 

as we purchase new tractors as part of our normal replacement cycle each year we rely on the used equipment market to dispose of our older equipment oversupply in the transportation industry as well as adverse domestic and foreign economic conditions can negatively impact the demand for used tractors and therefore reduce the value we can obtain on our used equipment if we are unable to sell our replacement vehicles at or above salvage value the resulting losses could have a significant impact on our results of operations 

  

we may be adversely impacted by fluctuations in the availability and price of diesel fuel 

diesel fuel is a critical component of our operations and a significant operating expense for our business diesel fuel prices and fuel availability can be impacted by factors beyond our control such as natural or manmade disasters political events price and supply decisions by oil producing countries and cartels terrorist activities armed conflict and world supply and demand imbalances we maintain fuel storage and pumping facilities at many of our service center locations however we may experience shortages in the availability of diesel fuel at certain locations and may be forced to incur additional expense to ensure adequate supply on a timely basis to prevent a disruption to our service schedules an interruption in the supply of diesel fuel could have a material adverse effect on our operating results 

we do not hedge against the risk of diesel fuel price increases an increase in diesel fuel prices or diesel fuel taxes or any change in federal or state regulations that results in such an increase could have a material adverse effect on our operating results we have fuel surcharge programs in place with a majority of our customers which have helped us offset the majority of the negative impact of the increased cost of diesel fuel and other petroleumbased products however we also incur fuel costs that cannot be recovered even with respect to customers with which we maintain fuel surcharge programs such as those associated with empty miles deadhead miles or the time when our engines are idling because our fuel surcharge recovery lags behind changes in fuel prices our fuel surcharge recovery may not capture the increased costs we pay for fuel especially when prices are rising leading to fluctuations in our levels of reimbursement further during periods of low freight volumes shippers can use their negotiating leverage to impose less compensatory fuel surcharge policies we regularly monitor the components of our pricing including fuel surcharges and address individual account profitability issues with our customers when necessary however there can be no assurance that fuel surcharges can be maintained indefinitely or will be sufficiently effective in offsetting increases in diesel fuel prices 

we are subject to various environmental laws and regulations and costs of compliance with liabilities under or violations of existing or future environmental laws or regulations could adversely affect our business 

we are subject to various federal state and local environmental laws and regulations that govern among other things the emission and discharge of hazardous materials into the environment the presence of hazardous materials at our properties or in our vehicles fuel storage tanks the transportation of certain materials and the discharge or retention of storm water under certain environmental laws we could also be held responsible for any costs relating to contamination at our past or present facilities and at thirdparty waste disposal sites as well as costs associated with the cleanup of accidents involving our vehicles environmental laws have become and are expected to continue to be increasingly more stringent over time and there can be no assurance that our costs of complying with current or future environmental laws or liabilities arising under such laws will not have a material adverse effect on our business operations or financial condition 

in addition to the epa regulations on exhaust emissions with which we must comply there is an increased regulatory focus on climate change and greenhouse gas emissions in the united states as a result we may become subject to additional legislation that could adversely impact our business at this time we cannot predict the requirements of any future regulations however any limitations on the emission of greenhouse gases or other environmental legislation could increase our future capital expenditures and have an adverse impact on our financial condition results of operations and liquidity 

we operate in a highly regulated industry and increased costs of compliance with or liability for violation of existing or future regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business 

we are regulated by the dot and by various state agencies these regulatory authorities have broad powers generally governing matters such as authority to engage in motor carrier operations as well as motor carrier registration driver hours of service safety and fitness of transportation equipment and drivers transportation of hazardous materials certain mergers and acquisitions and periodic financial reporting in addition the trucking industry is subject to regulatory and legislative changes from a variety of other governmental authorities which address matters such as i increasingly stringent environmental occupational safety and health regulations ii limits on vehicle weight and size iii ergonomics iv port security and v hours of service in addition we are subject to compliance with cargosecurity and transportation regulations issued by the transportation security administration within the us department 

  

of homeland security regulatory requirements and changes in regulatory requirements may affect our business or the economics of the industry by requiring changes in operating practices or by influencing the demand for and increasing the costs of providing transportation services 

in october 2009 the us court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit ordered the fmcsa to review and reissue rules governing hours of service for commercial truck drivers by july 26 2011 in response to this ruling on december 23 2010 the fmcsa issued a regulatory proposal subject to a public comment period that ends march 4 2011 this proposal addresses the length of driver work days the length and frequency of driver rest breaks driver “restart” periods following specified offduty hours and other matters relating to hours of service the final rules that will be adopted by the fmcsa are uncertain at this time and could have a significant impact on our operations and the cost of providing our services we are also subject to future rulemaking by the fmcsa and other regulatory agencies which could be more stringent require changes to our operations increase our operating costs and otherwise adversely impact our results of operations 

the implementation of fmcsa’s compliance safety accountability initiative “csa” could adversely impact our ability to hire qualified drivers meet our growth projections and maintain our customer relationships each of which could adversely impact our results of operations 

in december 2010 the fmcsa began implementation of csa a new compliance and enforcement initiative designed to monitor and improve commercial motor vehicle safety csa measures both the safety record of the motor carrier and the driver these measurements are scored and used by the fmcsa to identify potential safety risks and to direct enforcement action csa scores for transportation companies are currently available on the fmcsa’s website and replace safestat the fmcsa’s former safety measurement system 

our csa scores are dependent upon our safety and compliance experience which could change at any time in addition the safety standards prescribed in csa could change and our ability to maintain an acceptable score could be adversely impacted if we receive an unacceptable csa score our relationships with our customers could be damaged which could result in a loss of business 

the implementation of csa could also shrink the industry’s pool of drivers as those with unfavorable scores could leave the industry as a result the costs to attract train and retain qualified drivers could increase in addition a shortage of qualified drivers could increase driver turnover decrease asset utilization limit growth and adversely impact our results of operations 

our results of operations may be affected by seasonal factors and harsh weather conditions 

our operations are subject to seasonal trends common in the trucking industry our operating margins in the first quarter are normally lower due to reduced demand during the winter months harsh weather can also adversely affect our performance by reducing demand and reducing our ability to transport freight which could result in decreased revenue and increased operating expenses 

if we are unable to retain our key employees our financial condition results of operations and liquidity could be adversely affected 

our success will continue to depend upon the experience and leadership of our key employees and executive officers in that regard the loss of the services of any of our key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and liquidity 

our principal shareholders control a large portion of our outstanding common stock 

earl e congdon john r congdon and members of their respective families beneficially own approximately 28 of the outstanding shares of our common stock as long as the congdon family controls a large portion of our voting stock they may be able to significantly influence the election of the entire board of directors and the outcome of all matters involving a shareholder vote the congdon family’s interests may differ from the interests of other shareholders and the status of their ownership could change at their discretion in addition our chief executive officer david s congdon has pledged approximately 648000 shares of our common stock held in a revocable trust for his benefit to secure an approximately 35 million margin loan if there were a default the bank would have the right to sell shares to satisfy this obligation such an event could cause our stock price to decline 

  

our financial results may be adversely impacted by potential future changes in accounting practices 

future changes in accounting standards or practices and related legal and regulatory interpretations of those changes may adversely impact public companies in general the transportation industry or our operations specifically new accounting standards or requirements such as a conversion from us generally accepted accounting principles to international financial reporting standards could change the way we record revenues expenses assets andor liabilities or could be costly to implement these types of regulations could have a negative impact on our financial position liquidity results of operations andor access to capital 

our information technology systems are subject to certain risks that we cannot control 

our information systems including our accounting systems are dependent upon thirdparty software global communications providers telephone systems and other aspects of technology and internet infrastructure that are susceptible to failure although we have implemented redundant systems and network security measures our information technology remains susceptible to outages computer viruses breakins and similar disruptions that may inhibit our ability to provide services to our customers and the ability of our customers to access our systems this may result in the loss of customers or a reduction in demand for our services 

if we raise additional capital in the future your ownership in us could be diluted 

any issuance of equity we may undertake in the future to raise additional capital could cause the price of our common stock to decline or require us to issue shares at a price that is lower than that paid by holders of our common stock in the past which would result in those newly issued shares being dilutive if we obtain funds through a credit facility or through the issuance of debt or preferred securities these obligations and securities would likely have rights senior to your rights as a common shareholder which could impair the value of our common stock 

the market value of our common stock may fluctuate and could be substantially affected by various factors 

the price of our common stock on the nasdaq global select market or nasdaq constantly changes we expect that the market price of our common stock will continue to fluctuate our share price may fluctuate as a result of a variety of factors many of which are beyond our control these factors include among others 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 our common stock price may fluctuate significantly in the future and these fluctuations may be unrelated to our performance general market price declines or market volatility in the future could adversely affect the price of our common stock and the current market price of our common stock may not be indicative of future market prices 

  

our articles of incorporation our bylaws and virginia law contain provisions that could discourage delay or prevent a change in our control or our management 

provisions of our articles of incorporation bylaws and the laws of virginia the state in which we are incorporated may discourage delay or prevent a change in control of us or a change in management that shareholders may consider favorable these provisions 

 

  

  

  

  

 these provisions could discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for you and other shareholders to take certain corporate actions these provisions could also limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock

 item 2 properties 

we own our general office located in thomasville north carolina consisting of a twostory office building of approximately 160000 square feet on 301 acres of land at december 31 2010 we operated 213 service centers of which 132 were owned and 81 were leased our service centers that are owned include most of our larger facilities and account for 79 of the total door capacity in our network with the exception of our chicago illinois facility which has a lease that expires in 2021 we own our major breakbulk facilities each of our breakbulk facilities is listed below with the number of doors as of december 31 2010 

 

 our 213 facilities are strategically dispersed over the states in which we operate at december 31 2010 the terms of our leased properties ranged from monthtomonth to a lease that expires in 2023 we believe that as current leases expire we will be able to renew them or find comparable facilities without incurring any material negative impact on service to our customers or our operating results 

we also own 22 nonoperating properties all of which are held for lease or are planned for future use five of these properties are leased with lease terms that range from monthtomonth to a lease that expires in 2012 

we believe that all of our properties are in good repair and are capable of providing the level of service required by current business levels and customer demands in addition we believe we have sufficient capacity in our service center network to accommodate a substantial increase in demand for our services 




 item 3 legal proceedings 

we are involved in various legal proceedings and claims that have arisen in the ordinary course of our business that have not been fully adjudicated many of these are covered in whole or in part by insurance our management does not believe that these actions when finally concluded and determined will have a material adverse effect upon our financial position liquidity or results of operations

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

overview 

we are a leading lessthantruckload “ltl” nonunion motor carrier providing regional interregional and national ltl service and valueadded logistics services from a single integrated organization in addition to our core ltl services we offer our customers a broad range of logistics services including ground and air expedited transportation supply chain consulting transportation management truckload brokerage container delivery and warehousing services through marketing and carrier relationships we also offer doortodoor international freight services to and from all of north america central america south america and the far east more than 90 of our revenue has historically been derived from transporting ltl shipments for our customers whose demand for our services is generally tied to industrial production and the overall health of the us domestic economy 

  

in analyzing the components of our revenue we monitor changes and trends in the following key metrics 

 

  

  

  

 our primary revenue focus is to increase shipment and tonnage growth within our existing infrastructure generally referred to as increasing density thereby maximizing asset utilization and labor productivity we measure density over many different functional areas of our operations including revenue per service center linehaul load factor pd stops per hour pd shipments per hour platform pounds handled per hour and platform shipments per hour in addition to our focus on density it is critical for us to obtain an appropriate yield on the shipments we handle we manage our yields by focusing on individual account profitability we believe yield management and improvements in density are key components in our ability to produce profitable growth 

our primary cost elements are direct wages and benefits associated with the movement of freight operating supplies and expenses which includes fuel and repair parts and depreciation of our equipment fleet and service center facilities we gauge our overall success in managing these costs by monitoring our operating ratio a measure of profitability calculated by dividing total operating expenses by revenue which also allows industrywide comparisons with our competition 

we continually upgrade our technological capabilities to improve our customer service and lower our operating costs our technology provides our customers with visibility of their shipments throughout our network increases the productivity of our workforce and provides key metrics from which we can monitor our processes 

  

results of operations 

the following table sets forth for the years indicated expenses and other items as a percentage of revenue from operations 

 

  

 2010 compared to 2009 

key financial and operating metrics for 2010 and 2009 are presented below 

 

 during 2010 we achieved significant increases in our shipments and tonnage which accelerated during the second half of the year we believe these increases were the result of our ability to gain market share during the year as well as general growth in us industrial production and manufacturing as industry capacity tightened in 2010 many of our competitors implemented significant rate increases this 

  

reversed an industry trend of several years in which many of our competitors had discounted prices while we implemented a modest general rate increase in november 2010 our pricing philosophy remained consistent with our strategy throughout the recession which was to provide “bestinclass” ontime and claimsfree service at a fair and equitable price we believe more shippers are shifting their focus to evaluating the overall value of the service they receive as industry pricing increases we believe this trend along with other market dynamics will provide additional opportunities for us to increase tonnage and market share growth in 2011 

the significant growth in our tonnage resulted in increased density in our network that generally resulted in increased efficiency and productivity the overall improvement in our pricing during 2010 combined with the increased density resulted in improvements in our operating results net income increased in 2010 by 408 million or 1169 to 757 million and our operating ratio decreased by 360 basis points to 907 our 2010 results also reflect reductions in our depreciation and amortization expenses of approximately 127 million due to changes in the estimated useful lives and salvage values of certain equipment which are described further under “critical accounting policies” below 

revenue 

the 190 increase in revenue during 2010 was the result of increases in tonnage and revenue per hundredweight tonnage increased 154 for the year ended december 31 2010 due to the combination of a 100 increase in shipments and a 49 increase in weight per shipment the growth in tonnage per day and shipments per day accelerated during the second half of the year which we believe reflects our gain in market share as well as general economic improvement we believe the increase in our weight per shipment also indicates an improving economy although we also continue to gain market share with large national shippers that typically have heavier shipments 

revenue per hundredweight increased 31 to 1309 from 1270 in 2009 this increase primarily reflects an increase in fuel surcharges which are designed to offset fluctuations in the cost of petroleumbased products and are one of many components included in the overall price for our services excluding fuel surcharges revenue per hundredweight remained consistent between 2010 and 2009 despite the negative effect on this metric from the increase in weight per shipment this consistency reflects our ability to initiate necessary price increases during 2010 as industry conditions improved during the year our ability to obtain price increases strengthened we experienced improvement in the yearoveryear change in revenue per hundredweight excluding fuel surcharges for each month during the second half of 2010 and also implemented a general rate increase on certain of our tariffs effective november 15 2010 

fuel surcharge revenue increased to 123 of revenue from 96 in 2009 as a result of the increased price of diesel fuel during 2010 most of our tariffs and contracts provide for a fuel surcharge which is recorded as additional revenue as diesel fuel prices increase above stated levels these levels are generally indexed to the doe’s published fuel prices that reset each week the fuel surcharge is one of many components included in the overall negotiated price for our transportation services with our customers although it is generally considered to be a measure of the increase in cost of all petroleum products we use we regularly monitor the components of our pricing including base freight rates and fuel surcharges we also address individual account profitability issues with our customers when necessary as part of our effort to minimize the negative impact on our profitability that would likely result from a rapid and significant change in any of our operating expenses 

operating costs and other expenses 

salaries wages and benefits increased 901 million or 125 in 2010 which compares favorably with our revenue and tonnage growth of 190 and 154 respectively as a result and due somewhat to our increased use of purchased transportation in 2010 our salaries wages and benefits improved to 546 of revenue from 577 in the prior year salaries and wages increased 761 million due to a 164 increase in the total number of fulltime employees and an increase in the number of hours worked by existing employees which was in direct response to the increase in tonnage during the year in addition we implemented a 2 salary and wage increase for all employees on september 3 2010 

the increased density within our network allowed us to leverage the additional volumes at lower unit costs driver wages as a percentage of revenue improved to 217 from 231 in 2009 and platform 

  

wages improved to 66 of revenue from 68 in 2009 the increased density also allowed us to maintain efficient operations although we did not experience improvement in all of our productivity measures due to the costs of hiring and training new employees in our linehaul operations our laden load average increased 15 pd shipments per hour remained consistent with 2009 but our pd stops per hour decreased 07 

we benefited from a decrease in employee benefit costs as a percentage of salaries and wages to 315 in 2010 from 334 in 2009 much of this improvement is attributable to the improvement in our group health and dental costs as a percent of salaries and wages our group health costs have been favorably impacted by a decrease in the number of claims paid for participants under the consolidated omnibus budget reconciliation act of 1985 “cobra” and an overall decrease in the average severity of health insurance claims there is also a 90day wait period before newly hired employees are eligible to enroll in our health plan and the majority of the employees hired in 2010 were hired during the second half of the year as a result our group health costs are likely to increase in future periods as these new employees begin to enroll in our plan 

operating supplies and expenses increased to 165 of revenue in 2010 from 146 in 2009 this increase is primarily due to the increase in diesel fuel costs excluding fuel taxes which is the largest component of operating supplies and expenses these costs increased 445 during the year as a result of the combined effect of a 227 increase in our average price per gallon and a 121 increase in gallons consumed the increase in fuel consumption is primarily due to the yearoveryear increase in overall miles our increased consumption also resulted in the increase to our fuel tax expenses and was the principal driver of the 52 million increase in “operating taxes and licenses” we do not use diesel fuel hedging instruments and are therefore subject to market price fluctuations 

depreciation and amortization expense decreased to 54 of revenue in 2010 as compared to 76 in 2009 our capital expenditure requirements were reduced for 2010 due to the available capacity throughout the year in our fleet and service center network the operating leverage created by our reduced capital expenditures and the 154 increase in tonnage contributed to the decrease in depreciation and amortization expense as a percent of revenue the improvement as a percent of revenue also reflects the approximate 127 million decrease in depreciation expense that resulted from changes in the estimated useful lives and salvage values of certain equipment effective january 1 2010 the changes we made are described in more detail under “critical accounting policies” below 

we purchase linehaul transportation and pd services from other motor carriers and railroads we also utilize independent contractors for our container operations we utilize these services when it is economically beneficial or when there are imbalances of freight flow within our service center network purchased transportation expense increased to 34 of revenue in 2010 from 27 in 2009 these costs increased primarily because of certain imbalances of freight flow within our network which is attributable to the significant increase in our tonnage in response to our tonnage growth we increased our fulltime headcount by 1571 employees since december 31 2009 the majority of these newly hired employees are drivers and platform employees as we begin to balance our internal resources with freight demand we intend to reduce our use of purchased transportation as it is more efficient and profitable to utilize our own personnel and equipment 

our effective tax rate for 2010 was 392 as compared to 390 in 2009 our effective tax rates in 2010 and 2009 were favorably impacted by alternative fuel tax credits for the use of propane in our operations these fuel tax credits were originally scheduled to expire on december 31 2009 however they were extended to december 31 2011 with the passage of the tax relief unemployment insurance reauthorization and job creation act of 2010 in december 2010 our effective tax rate exceeded the federal statutory rate of 35 primarily due to the impact of state taxes and certain nondeductible items 

  

2009 compared to 2008 

key financial and operating metrics for 2009 and 2008 are presented below 

 

 our financial results for 2009 reflect our operating strengths as we remained profitable despite a significant decline in tonnage and revenue which resulted from the negative impacts of a recessionary economy and an increasingly competitive operating environment within the ltl industry the persistent recessionary economy caused freight demand to weaken throughout 2009 when combined with the overcapacity in the ltl industry the weakened demand created an aggressive and competitive pricing environment confronted with this environment and an 116 decline in tonnage we focused on delivering outstanding service performance improving the productivity of our employees managing our variable costs and remaining disciplined with the pricing for our services despite the success we had with these measures we were unable to sufficiently increase our prices or generate enough cost savings to offset our decline in revenue as a result our operating ratio increased to 943 in 2009 from 916 in 2008 and our earnings per diluted share decreased 496 to 062 for 2009 we believe our strategy mitigated much of the negative impact that we could have experienced as a result of the extremely difficult ltl operating environment since our operating ratio deteriorated by only 270 basis points despite a 190 decline in revenue 

revenue 

the decrease in revenue during 2009 was the result of decreases in tonnage and revenue per hundredweight of 116 and 85 respectively the reduction in tonnage during 2009 resulted from a 141 decrease in the number of shipments that was partially offset by a 29 increase in weight per shipment the tonnage decrease was primarily attributable to the impact of the recessionary economy on freight demand since our research indicates there has been no significant change in our market share we could experience additional declines in our tonnage and shipments as well as continued pressure on our yields however we believe we have positioned ourselves well through our commitment to service to gain additional market share from our existing customers and new customers who seek consistent claimsfree and valuedriven service once industry conditions improve 

revenue per hundredweight decreased 85 to 1270 in 2009 from 1388 in 2008 this decrease in our revenue per hundredweight was primarily due to the reduction in fuel surcharge revenue which resulted from a significant decline in the average price of diesel fuel between the comparable years excluding fuel surcharges revenue per hundredweight remained consistent at 1149 for 2009 and 2008 we were unable to sufficiently increase our overall pricing during 2009 due to the competitive pricing environment in the ltl industry during the fourth quarter of 2008 and throughout 2009 pricing emerged as the principal driver of competition as many carriers attempted to either gain market share or minimize tonnage losses through price discounting despite the pricing pressure we remained committed to our pricing philosophy of charging our customers a fair and reasonable price for outstanding service our commitment to service was evidenced by an approximate 99 ontime service performance and a historically low cargo claims ratio during 2009 

fuel surcharge revenue decreased to 96 of revenue in 2009 from 172 in 2008 most of our tariffs and contracts provide for a fuel surcharge which is recorded as additional revenue as diesel fuel prices increase above stated levels these levels are generally indexed to the doe’s published fuel 

  

prices that reset each week the fuel surcharge is one of many components included in the overall negotiated price for our transportation services with our customers although it is generally believed to be a measure of the increase in cost of all petroleum products that we use we continuously monitor the components of our pricing including base freight rates and fuel surcharges we also address individual account profitability issues with our customers when necessary as part of our effort to minimize the negative impact on our profitability that would likely result from a rapid and significant change in any of our operating expenses 

operating costs and other expenses 

salaries wages and benefits increased to 577 of revenue in 2009 from 523 in 2008 the increase as a percent of revenue is primarily due to the yearoveryear decline in fuel surcharge revenue which has no corresponding decrease in the volume of freight moving through our network as a result driver wages increased to 231 of revenue from 210 in 2008 platform wages as a percentage of revenue increased to 68 from 67 in 2008 

while our salaries wages and benefits increased as a percent of revenue the 859 million overall decrease is attributable to the 116 yearoveryear reduction in the total number of fulltime employees the decline in the number of hours worked and the overall increased productivity of our employees our pd shipments per hour increased 39 and pd stops per hour increased 34 both reflecting the improved efficiencies and utilization of our experienced drivers our linehaul laden load average increased 05 platform pounds handled per hour increased 93 which allowed our platform wages to remain consistent as a percent of revenue these productivity improvements partially offset the impact on our operating ratio of the annual wage increase provided to our driver and platform employees in september 2008 as well as the scheduled increases newly hired employees achieved in 2009 as they gained experience 

employee benefit costs increased to 334 of salaries and wages in 2009 from 301 in 2008 these increases are primarily attributable to increased costs associated with our group health and dental coverage and workers’ compensation claims experience group health and dental costs rose to 122 of total salary and wages in 2009 from 103 in 2008 due to an increase in the average cost of medical claims per employee as well as an increase in the number of claims paid for participants who elected coverage under the consolidated omnibus budget reconciliation act of 1985 “cobra” legislation passed in 2009 lengthened the period of coverage for eligible cobra participants who were involuntarily terminated between september 1 2008 and february 28 2010 

operating supplies and expenses decreased to 146 of revenue in 2009 from 199 in 2008 this decrease is primarily due to the decline in diesel fuel costs excluding fuel taxes which is the largest component of operating supplies and expenses these costs decreased 504 during the year as a result of the combined effect of a 373 decrease in our average price per gallon and a 128 decrease in gallons consumed the reduction in fuel consumption is primarily due to the yearoveryear decline in overall miles as well as a 22 increase in our miles per gallon the decreased consumption also lowered our fuel tax expenses and was the principal driver of the 25 million reduction in “operating taxes and licenses” we do not use diesel fuel hedging instruments and are therefore subject to market price fluctuations which we manage primarily through the application of fuel surcharges 

general supplies and expenses remained consistent as a percent of revenue at 29 for both 2009 and 2008 these costs remained consistent as a percent of revenue due to our strict cost control measures put in place to manage our variable costs and the decrease in supplies directly related to lower shipment volumes 

the decrease in insurance and claims expense to 18 of revenue from 23 in 2008 is attributable to the 321 and 390 decreases in auto liability and cargo claims expenses respectively we selfinsure a portion of our auto and cargo claims liabilities and obtain excess insurance coverage for claims above our retention levels the decrease in our auto liability expenses was primarily due to a 19 million favorable adjustment recorded in the fourth quarter that resulted from improved experience in the number and severity of claims during 2009 we believe that our cargo claims expense improved primarily due to the increased training of our employees on claims prevention which resulted in a historically low cargo claims ratio in 2009 and a 328 decrease in total claims paid 

  

depreciation and amortization expense increased to 76 of revenue in 2009 as compared to 57 in 2008 the increase as a percent of revenue reflects the combined impact of the decline in overall revenue in 2009 on these fixed costs and our significant investments in real estate and revenue equipment in 2008 and 2009 consistent with our longterm growth strategy we took advantage of real estate opportunities during 2009 which allowed us not only to expand our service center network but also to relocate certain operations to larger facilities in addition we made a strategic decision to purchase new revenue equipment in 2009 while retaining the tractors and trailers scheduled to be replaced our decision to increase our equipment capacity placed us in a position to accommodate an increase in demand for our services that could have resulted from business failures or consolidation in the ltl industry that we believed were likely to result from the recessionary economy 

other expense net includes the net investment gains or losses on the cash value of our variable life insurance contracts related to our nonqualified deferred compensation plans the cash value of these contracts was impacted by the improvement in equity markets during 2009 which favorably affected comparisons with 2008 

our effective tax rate for 2009 and 2008 was 390 our effective tax rates in 2009 and 2008 were favorably impacted by alternative fuel tax credits for the use of propane in our operations our effective tax rate exceeded the federal statutory rate of 35 primarily due to the impact of state taxes and certain nondeductible items 

liquidity and capital resources 

a summary of our cash flows is presented below 

 

 we have three primary sources of available liquidity to fund our estimated capital expenditures cash and cash equivalents cash flows from operations and available borrowings under our senior unsecured revolving credit agreement which is described below we believe we also have sufficient access to debt and equity markets to provide another source of liquidity if needed 

on january 3 2011 we entered into a note purchase agreement pursuant to which we issued 950 million of privatelyplaced senior notes we entered into this note purchase agreement to fund planned capital expenditures and for general corporate purposes we used a portion of the proceeds to refinance existing indebtedness including paying down the outstanding balance on our senior unsecured revolving credit agreement 

to facilitate our access to the equity market we filed an automatic shelf registration statement with the sec during the fourth quarter of 2009 that provides us with the opportunity to offer and sell shares of common stock on a delayed or continuous basis at indeterminate prices from time to time pursuant to this automatic shelf registration we filed a prospectus supplement and entered into an atthemarket equity offering sales agreement the “atm agreement” on february 2 2011 with stifel nicolaus  company incorporated “stifel nicolaus weisel” pursuant to which we may issue and sell from time to time over a 12month period through or to stifel nicolaus weisel shares of our common stock having an aggregate offering price of up to 1000 million the “offering” sales of our common stock in the offering if any will be made by means of ordinary brokers’ transactions on nasdaq in privately negotiated transactions or otherwise at market prices prevailing at the time of sale at prices relating to prevailing market prices or at negotiated prices as agreed by stifel nicolaus weisel and us we have no obligation to sell any shares of our common stock in the offering and may at any time terminate the offering and atm agreement as of the date of this annual report on form 10k we have not sold any shares of our common stock in the offering 

  

capital expenditures 

the table below sets forth our net capital expenditures for property and equipment including those obtained through acquisition of business assets and capital leases for the years ended december 31 2010 2009 and 2008 

 

 our capital expenditure requirements are generally based upon the expansion in the number and size of service center facilities to support our plan for longterm growth our planned tractor and trailer replacement cycle and forecasted revenue growth our capital expenditures for land and structures in 2010 were lower than 2009 and 2008 as we had sufficient capacity in our service center network at the beginning of the year due to the decline in tonnage during 2009 as a result we opened fewer new facilities during 2010 and expansion projects for existing service centers were smaller in scale than in previous years due to our current volume trends however we anticipate our capital expenditures for land and structures will be significantly higher in 2011 than 2010 to help ensure our service center network is not a limiting factor to our longterm growth in addition we anticipate a significant increase in our capital expenditures for tractors and trailers in 2011 as our purchases for the past three years were primarily limited to replacing a portion of the equipment being retired through the normal replacement cycle 

we currently project capital expenditures net of anticipated proceeds from dispositions to be approximately 265 million to 300 million for the year ending december 31 2011 of our capital expenditures approximately 120 million to 140 million is allocated for the purchase of service center facilities construction of new service center facilities or expansion of existing service center facilities approximately 130 million to 140 million is allocated for the purchase of tractors and trailers and approximately 15 million to 20 million is allocated for investments in technology we expect to fund these capital expenditures through cash flows from operations the remaining proceeds from the 950 million of privatelyplaced senior notes issued in january 2011 the use of our senior unsecured revolving credit facility and proceeds from the atm agreement if any we believe our current sources of liquidity will be sufficient to satisfy our expected capital expenditures 

we anticipate that there will be additional environmental regulations and legislation resulting from the increased regulatory focus on climate change and greenhouse gas emissions in the united states at this time we cannot predict the requirements of any future regulations however any limitations on the emission of greenhouse gases or other environmental legislation could increase our future capital expenditures and have an adverse impact on our financial condition results of operations and liquidity 

financing agreements 

we have a 2250 million senior unsecured revolving credit facility pursuant to the terms of an amended and restated credit agreement that matures on august 10 2011 the “credit agreement” with wells fargo national association as successor by merger to wachovia bank national association “wells fargo” serving as administrative agent for the lenders which also include bank of america na branch banking and trust company suntrust bank us bank national association and high point bank and trust company of the 2250 million line of credit commitments 1500 million may be used for letters of credit and 150 million may be used for borrowings under wells fargo’s sweep program the sweep program is a daily cash management tool that automatically initiates borrowings to cover overnight cash requirements up to an aggregate of 150 million or initiates overnight investments for 

  

excess cash balances in addition we have the right to request an increase in the line of credit commitments up to a total of 3000 million in minimum increments of 250 million at our option revolving loans under the facility bear interest at either i the higher of wells fargo’s prime rate or the federal funds rate plus 05 per annum ii libor one two three or six months plus an applicable margin “adjusted libor rate” or iii onemonth libor plus an applicable margin “libor index rate” the applicable margin is determined by a pricing grid in the credit agreement and ranges from 05 to 1125 the applicable margin for the credit agreement in 2010 was 0625 revolving loans under the sweep program bear interest at the libor index rate 

the credit agreement contains customary covenants including financial covenants that require us to observe a maximum ratio of debt to total capital and a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio any future whollyowned subsidiaries of old dominion would be required to guarantee payment of all of our obligations under the facility the amounts outstanding and remaining borrowing capacity under our credit agreement are presented below 

 

 commitment fees ranging from 01 to 0225 are charged quarterly in arrears on the aggregate unutilized portion of the credit agreement letter of credit fees equal to the applicable margin for adjusted libor rate loans are charged quarterly in arrears on the daily average aggregate stated amount of all letters of credit outstanding during the quarter the commitment fees and letter of credit fees were 0125 and 0625 respectively for the credit agreement in 2010 in addition a facing fee at an annual rate of 0125 is charged quarterly in arrears on the daily average aggregate stated amount of all letters of credit outstanding during such quarter 

we have two unsecured senior note agreements with an aggregate amount outstanding of 2036 million at december 31 2010 these notes call for periodic principal payments with maturities in 2015 and 2016 of which 357 million is due in the next twelve months interest rates on these notes are fixed at 468 and 585 the effective average interest rate on our outstanding senior note agreements was 554 at december 31 2010 and 2009 

with the exception of borrowings pursuant to the credit agreement interest rates are fixed on all of our debt instruments therefore shortterm exposure to fluctuations in interest rates is limited to our line of credit facility we do not currently use interest rate derivative instruments to manage exposure to interest rate changes 

our credit agreement limits the amount of dividends that could be paid to shareholders to the greater of i 100 million ii the amount of dividends paid in the immediately preceding fiscal year or iii an amount equal to 25 of net income from the immediately preceding fiscal year we did not declare or pay a dividend on our common stock in 2010 or 2009 and we have no plans to declare or pay a dividend in 2011 

a significant decrease in demand for our services could limit our ability to generate cash flow and affect profitability most of our debt agreements have covenants that require stated levels of financial performance which if not achieved could cause acceleration of the payment schedules as of december 31 2010 we were in compliance with these covenants we do not anticipate a significant decline in business levels or financial performance that would cause us to violate any such covenants in the future and we believe the combination of our existing credit agreement along with our additional borrowing capacity will be sufficient to meet foreseeable seasonal and longterm capital needs 

recent developments 

at december 31 2010 the outstanding balance on our credit agreement of 662 million is reported as a longterm liability despite the facility’s maturity within one year of our balance sheet date as we 

  

utilized a portion of the 950 million of proceeds obtained from the privatelyplaced senior notes to refinance the outstanding balance on the credit agreement we have initiated discussions regarding the renewal and extension of our credit agreement with wells fargo the administrative agent for the lenders as well as other lenders in our bank group we intend and believe we have the ability to extend the current credit agreement with adjustments to our interest rates and fees to current market rates we plan to finalize a new agreement in the second quarter of 2011 if we are unable to do so we believe our remaining sources of liquidity will be sufficient to meet our expected liquidity needs for the foreseeable future 

as discussed above we entered into a note purchase agreement on january 3 2011 pursuant to which we issued 950 million of privatelyplaced senior notes in addition and as discussed above we entered into the atm agreement on february 2 2011 that allows us to issue and sell from time to time shares of our common stock having an aggregate offering price of up to 1000 million 

common stock split 

on july 30 2010 our board of directors approved a threefortwo common stock split for shareholders of record as of the close of business on august 9 2010 on august 23 2010 those shareholders received one additional share of common stock for every two shares owned in lieu of fractional shares shareholders received a cash payment based on the average of the high and low sales prices of the common stock on the record date 

all references in this report to shares outstanding weighted average shares outstanding and earnings per share amounts have been restated retroactively to reflect this stock split 

contractual obligations 

the following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations as of december 31 2010 

 

  

 offbalance sheet arrangements 

as of december 31 2010 we had no offbalance sheet arrangements as defined in item 303a4ii of sec regulation sk 

  

critical accounting policies 

in preparing our financial statements we apply the following critical accounting policies that we believe affect our judgments and estimates of amounts recorded in certain assets liabilities revenue and expenses these critical accounting policies are further described in note 1 of the notes to the financial statements included in item 8 of this report 

revenue recognition 

we recognize revenue based upon when our transportation services have been completed in accordance with the bill of lading contract our general tariff provisions or contractual agreements with our customers generally this occurs when we complete the delivery of a shipment for transportation services not completed at the end of a reporting period we use a percentage of completion method to allocate the appropriate revenue to each separate reporting period under this method we develop a factor for each uncompleted shipment by dividing the actual number of days in transit at the end of a reporting period by that shipment’s standard delivery time schedule this factor is applied to the total revenue for that shipment and revenue is allocated between reporting periods accordingly 

allowances for uncollectible accounts and revenue adjustments 

we maintain an allowance for uncollectible accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments we estimate this allowance by analyzing the aging of our customer receivables our historical loss experience and other trends and factors affecting the credit risk of our customers we determine customer receivables to be past due when payment has not been received by the invoice due date writeoffs occur when we determine an account to be uncollectible and could differ from our allowance estimate as a result of factors such as changes in the overall economic environment or risks surrounding our customers additional allowances may be required if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments we periodically review the underlying assumptions in our estimate of the allowance for uncollectible accounts to ensure that the allowance reflects the most recent trends and factors 

we also maintain an allowance for revenue adjustments resulting from billing corrections customer allowances moneyback service guarantees and other miscellaneous revenue adjustments these revenue adjustments are recorded in our revenue from operations we use historical experience trends and current information to update and evaluate these estimates 

management believes the methodologies for estimating these allowances to be reliable based on the accuracy of our estimates in prior periods as such we do not anticipate any nearterm changes in our methodologies for these estimates 

claims and insurance accruals 

claims and insurance accruals reflect the estimated cost of claims for cargo loss and damage bipd workers’ compensation longterm disability group health and group dental not covered by insurance the related costs are charged to insurance and claims expense except for workers’ compensation longterm disability group health and group dental which are charged to employee benefits expense 

insurers providing excess coverage above retention levels adjust their premiums to cover insured losses and for other market factors as a result we periodically evaluate our selfinsured retention levels to determine the most costefficient balance between selfinsurance and excess coverage 

in establishing accruals for claims and insurance expenses we evaluate and monitor each claim individually and we use factors such as historical claims development experience known trends and thirdparty estimates to determine the appropriate reserves for potential liability we believe the assumptions and methods used to estimate these liabilities are reasonable however any changes in the severity of previouslyreported claims significant changes in the medical costs and regulatory changes affecting the administration of our plans could significantly impact the determination of appropriate reserves in future periods 

  

property and equipment 

property and equipment are recorded at cost and depreciated on a straightline basis over their estimated economic lives management uses historical experience certain assumptions and estimates in determining the economic life of each asset periodically we review property and equipment for impairment due to changes in operational and market conditions and we adjust the carrying value and economic life of any impaired asset as appropriate 

during the first quarter of 2010 we completed an evaluation of the estimated useful lives and salvage values for our equipment and determined that the actual period of service of certain revenue equipment exceeded that of our previously estimated useful lives as a result we extended the estimated useful lives of most of our tractors to 9 years from 7 years and extended the estimated useful lives of our trailers to 15 years from 12 years in addition we reduced the estimated salvage values associated with this equipment to more accurately reflect the value we believe such equipment will have at the end of its respective useful life we made similar changes to the estimated useful lives and salvage values for certain of our other equipment but the results of these changes had less of an impact on our future depreciation expense as a result of the impact on depreciation from these changes that were effective january 1 2010 income from continuing operations and net income in 2010 increased by approximately 127 million and 77 million respectively or 014 per diluted share 

effective january 1 2010 estimated economic lives for structures are 7 to 30 years revenue equipment is 4 to 15 years other equipment is 2 to 20 years and leasehold improvements are the lesser of the economic life of the leasehold improvement or the remaining life of the lease the use of different assumptions estimates or significant changes in the resale market for our equipment could result in material changes in the carrying value and related depreciation of our assets 

inflation 

most of our expenses are affected by inflation which typically results in increased operating costs in response to fluctuations in the cost of petroleum products particularly diesel fuel we generally include a fuel surcharge in our tariffs and contractual agreements the fuel surcharge is designed to offset the cost of diesel fuel above a base price and increases as diesel fuel prices escalate over the base which is generally indexed to the doe’s published fuel prices that reset each week volatility in the price of diesel fuel independent of inflation has impacted our business as described in this report however we do not believe inflation has had a material effect on our results of operations for each of the past three years 

related person transactions 

family relationships 

each of earl e congdon john r congdon david s congdon john r congdon jr and john b yowell who passed away on december 30 2010 are related to one another and served in various executive management positions andor on our board of directors during 2010 we have entered into amended and restated employment agreements with earl e congdon john r congdon david s congdon and john b yowell which are incorporated by reference as exhibits to our annual report on form 10k we regularly disclose the amount of compensation that we pay to these individuals in the proxy statement for our annual meeting of shareholders 

transactions with old dominion truck leasing inc 

old dominion truck leasing inc “leasing” is a north carolina corporation whose voting stock is owned by an earl e congdon revocable trust the john r congdon revocable trust and members of earl e congdon’s and john r congdon’s families leasing is primarily engaged in the business of purchasing and leasing tractors trailers and other vehicles john r congdon is chairman of the board of leasing and earl e congdon is vice chairman of the board of leasing since 1986 we have combined our requirements with leasing for the purchase of tractors trailers equipment parts tires and fuel we believe that the termination of this arrangement however would not have a material adverse impact on our financial results 

  

for the year ended december 31 2008 we charged leasing 11000 for vehicle repair maintenance and other services we provided to leasing at cost plus a negotiated markup for the years ended december 31 2010 and 2009 we did not provide such services to leasing we also charged leasing 17000 12000 and 12000 for the rental of a service center facility in 2010 2009 and 2008 respectively in 2008 we sold leasing equipment at its fair market value of 33000 

we purchased 242000 231000 and 260000 of maintenance and other services from leasing in 2010 2009 and 2008 respectively we believe that the prices we pay for such services are lower than those that would be charged by unaffiliated third parties for the same quality of work and we intend to continue to purchase maintenance and other services from leasing provided that leasing’s prices continue to be favorable to us 

we also paid leasing 86000 114000 and 257000 for leased equipment in 2010 2009 and 2008 respectively these lease payments were for longterm leases that expired in january 2011 for tractors available for use in our linehaul operations we received no commission or other financial benefit from leasing or any other party in connection with these lease transactions 

split dollar life insurance policies 

we are the owner of two splitdollar life insurance contracts insuring the life of john r congdon the net cash surrender value for these policies was 63 million and 25 million at december 31 2010 and 2009 respectively and is included on our balance sheets under the caption “other assets” at december 31 2010 these policies provided for an aggregate of 85 million in net death benefits due to the company of which we have endorsed 20 million to mr congdon’s children 

audit committee approval 

the audit committee of our board of directors reviewed and approved all of the related person transactions described above in accordance with our related person transactions policy 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact our financial position results of operations and cash flows due to adverse changes in financial market prices and rates 

we are exposed to interest rate risk directly related to loans under our credit agreement which have variable interest rates the average principal balance and the effective annual interest rate under the revolving credit agreement for 2010 were 712 million and 183 respectively a 100 basis point increase in the average interest rate on this agreement would have a 07 million impact on our operating results we have established policies and procedures to manage exposure to market risks and use major institutions that we believe are creditworthy to minimize credit risk 

we are exposed to market risk for equity investments relating to companyowned life insurance contracts on certain employees at december 31 2010 the cash value for variable life insurance contracts was 154 million of the total 258 million of cash values for all life insurance contracts included on our balance sheets in “other assets” variable life insurance contracts expose us to fluctuations in equity markets however we utilize a thirdparty to manage these assets and minimize that exposure a 10 change in market value in those investments would have a 15 million impact on our operating income 

we are exposed to market risk for shares of stock awarded under the old dominion freight line inc phantom stock plan and the old dominion freight line inc director phantom stock plan the liability for the unsettled phantom shares outstanding is remeasured at the end of each reporting period based on the closing price of our common stock at that date at december 31 2010 the total liability for shares related to the old dominion freight line inc phantom stock plan and the old dominion freight line inc director phantom stock plan totaled 72 million a 10 change in the price of our common stock at december 31 2010 would have had a 06 million impact on our operating income in 2010 

  

we are also exposed to commodity price risk related to diesel fuel prices and manage our exposure to that risk primarily through the application of fuel surcharges 

for further discussion related to these risks see note 2 to the financial statements included in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” and item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations”

unless the context requires otherwise references in this report to “old dominion” the “company” “we” “us” and “our” refer to old dominion freight line inc 

overview 

old dominion is a leading lessthantruckload “ltl” nonunion motor carrier providing regional interregional and national ltl service and valueadded logistics services from a single integrated organization we operate as one business segment and offer our products and services through our four branded product groups oddomestic odexpedited odglobal and odtechnology we have grown to be the sixth largest ltl motor carrier in the united states as measured by 2008 revenue according to transport topics  in addition to our ltl services we offer our customers a broad range of logistics services including ground and air expedited transportation supply chain consulting transportation management truckload brokerage container delivery and warehousing services through marketing and carrier relationships we also offer doortodoor international freight services to and from all of north america central america south america and the far east our services are complemented by our technological capabilities which provide the tools to improve the efficiency of our operations while empowering our customers to manage their shipping needs 

we have grown our revenue and customer base through both organic growth and strategic acquisitions prior to 1995 we provided regional service within the southeastern region of the united states as well as interregional service connecting the southeast to select major metropolitan areas we have since expanded our infrastructure to provide nextday and secondday service within each of our six regions that now cover the entire continental united states as well as expanded our interregional and national service between these regions to support this geographic expansion we increased our number of service centers from 53 at december 31 1995 to 210 at december 31 2009 including 72 new service centers in the past five years 

we attribute our growth to our focus on meeting our customers’ complete supply chain needs from a single point of contact with a high level of customer service supported by continual investment in our employees 

  

service center network and technology our integrated structure allows us to offer our customers consistent and continuous service from origin to destination we believe our operating structure and proprietary information systems enable us to provide higher customer service levels and better manage our operating costs 

we were organized in 1934 and incorporated in virginia in 1950 our principal executive offices are located at 500 old dominion way thomasville north carolina 27360 please refer to the balance sheets and statements of operations included in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” of this report for information regarding our total assets revenue from operations and net income 

our industry 

trucking companies provide transportation services to virtually every industry operating in the united states and generally offer higher levels of reliability and faster transit times than other surface transportation options the trucking industry is comprised principally of two types of motor carriers ltl and truckload ltl carriers pick up multiple shipments from multiple customers on a single truck and then route that freight for delivery through service centers where the freight may be transferred to other trucks with similar destinations in contrast truckload carriers generally dedicate an entire trailer to one customer from origin to destination 

according to the american trucking associations the trucking industry accounted for 831 of total domestic freight revenue in 2008 or 6603 billion of which the ltl sector accounted for 78 or 518 billion in contrast to truckload carriers ltl motor carriers require expansive networks of local pickup and delivery “pd” service centers as well as larger breakbulk or hub facilities significant capital is required of ltl motor carriers to create and maintain a network of service centers and a fleet of tractors and trailers the high fixed costs and capital spending requirements for ltl motor carriers makes it difficult for new startup or small operators to effectively compete with established companies in addition successful ltl motor carriers generally employ and continuously update a high level of technology to provide information to customers and to reduce operating costs 

the ltl industry is highly competitive on the basis of service and price and has consolidated significantly since the industry was deregulated in 1980 based on 2008 revenue the top 25 ltl motor carriers accounted for approximately 60 of the total ltl market consolidation has accelerated in recent years due to an increase in customer demand for single transportation providers offering both national and regional ltl service and complex supply chain services which smaller regional carriers with lesser financial resources are generally unable to provide we believe consolidation will continue particularly in the current economic environment which appears to have substantially weakened the financial condition of many of our competitors 

competition 

we compete with regional interregional and national ltl carriers and to a lesser extent with truckload carriers small package carriers airfreight carriers and railroads competition is based primarily on service price and business relationships we believe that we are able to compete effectively in our markets by providing highquality and timely service at competitive prices 

at all levels of our organization we seek to continuously improve customer service by maximizing ontime performance while reducing transit times and minimizing cargo claims we believe our transit times are generally faster than those of our principal national competitors in part because of our more efficient service center network use of team drivers and proprietary technology in addition we provide greater geographic coverage than most of our regional competitors our diversified mix and scope of regional interregional and national service enables us to provide our customers with a single source to meet their ltl shipping needs and we believe this provides us with a distinct advantage over our regional multiregional and national competition 

  

we also believe our nonunion workforce gives us a significant advantage over our unionized ltl competitors by utilizing flexible scheduling and training our employees to perform multiple tasks we believe we achieve greater productivity and higher levels of customer service we believe our focus on communication continued education development and motivation strengthens the relationships among our employees 

we compete with several larger transportation service providers each of which may have more equipment a broader coverage network and a wider range of services than we have our larger competitors may also have greater financial resources and in general the ability to reduce prices to gain business especially during times of reduced growth rates in the economy 

service center operations 

at december 31 2009 we conducted operations through 210 service center locations of which we own 125 and lease 85 we operate nine major breakbulk facilities in atlanta georgia rialto california indianapolis indiana greensboro north carolina harrisburg pennsylvania memphis and morristown tennessee dallas texas and salt lake city utah while using some smaller service centers for limited breakbulk activity in order to serve our nextday markets our service centers are strategically located in six regions of the country to provide the highest quality service and minimize freight rehandling costs 

each of our service centers is responsible for the pickup and delivery of freight within its service area each service center loads outbound freight by destination the day it is picked up all inbound freight received by the service center in the evening or during the night is scheduled for local delivery the next business day unless a customer requests a different delivery schedule our management reviews the productivity and service performance of each service center on a daily basis to ensure quality service and efficient operations 

while we have established primary responsibility for customer service at the local service center level our customers may access information and initiate transactions through our centralized customer service department located at our corporate office or several other gateways such as our website electronic data interchange “edi” automated voice response systems and automated fax systems our systems offer direct access to information such as freight tracking shipping documents rate quotes rate databases and account activity these centralized systems and our customer service department provide our customers with a single point of contact to access information across all areas of our operations and for each of our service products 

linehaul transportation 

linehaul dispatchers are centralized at our corporate office and control the movement of freight among service centers through integrated freight movement systems we also utilize loadplanning software to optimize efficiencies in our linehaul operations our senior management continuously monitors freight movements transit times load factors and other productivity measurements to ensure that we maintain our highest levels of service and efficiency 

we utilize scheduled routes and additional linehaul dispatches as necessary to meet our published service standards in addition we lower our cost structure by maintaining flexible workforce rules and by primarily using twin 28foot trailers in our linehaul operations the use of twin 28foot trailers permits us to transport freight directly from its point of origin to destination with minimal unloading and reloading which also reduces cargo loss and damage expenses we also utilize longcombination vehicles such as triple 28foot trailers and combinations of 48foot and 28foot trailers in states where permitted twin trailers and longcombination vehicles permit more freight to be hauled behind a tractor than could otherwise be hauled by one large trailer 

  

tractors trailers and maintenance 

at december 31 2009 we owned 5390 tractors we generally use new tractors in linehaul operations for approximately three to five years and then transfer those tractors to pd operations for the remainder of their useful lives in many of our service centers tractors perform pd functions during the day and linehaul functions at night to maximize tractor utilization 

at december 31 2009 we operated a fleet of 21185 trailers we primarily purchase new trailers for our operations however we occasionally purchase preowned equipment that meets our specifications 

at various times we have also acquired tractors and trailers through our acquisition of business assets from other carriers the purchase of preowned equipment can provide an excellent value but can increase our fleet’s average age the table below reflects as of december 31 2009 the average age of our tractors trucks and trailers 

 

 we develop certain specifications for tractors and trailers and then negotiate the production and purchase of this equipment with several manufacturers these purchases are planned well in advance of anticipated delivery dates in order to accommodate manufacturers’ production schedules we believe that there is sufficient capacity among suppliers to ensure an uninterrupted supply of equipment to support our operations 

the table below sets forth our capital expenditures for tractors and trailers for the years ended december 31 2009 2008 and 2007 our capital expenditures for tractors and trailers in 2009 were limited to replacing a portion of the equipment scheduled to be retired through the normal replacement cycle we retained this equipment scheduled for replacement however to provide sufficient capacity for us to take advantage of any increase in demand for our services caused by improvements in the economy potential business failures or consolidation in the ltl industry as a result of our current capacity our equipment purchases in 2010 should be significantly reduced 

 

 at december 31 2009 we had major maintenance operations at our service centers in rialto california denver colorado atlanta georgia indianapolis indiana kansas city and parsons kansas greensboro north carolina columbus ohio harrisburg pennsylvania morristown and memphis tennessee dallas texas and salt lake city utah in addition eighteen other service center locations are equipped to perform routine and preventive maintenance and repairs on our equipment 

we adhere to established maintenance policies and procedures to ensure our fleet is properly maintained linehaul tractors are routed to appropriate maintenance facilities at designated mileage or time intervals depending upon how the equipment was utilized pd tractors and trailers are scheduled for maintenance every 90 days 

  

marketing and customers 

at december 31 2009 we had a sales staff of 453 employees we compensate our sales force in part based upon ontime service performance revenue generated and company and service center profitability which we believe helps motivate our sales employees to achieve our service growth and profitability objectives 

we utilize a computerized freightcosting model to determine the price level at which a particular shipment of freight will be profitable we can modify elements of this freightcosting model to simulate the actual conditions under which the freight will be moved we also compete for business by participating in bid solicitations customers generally solicit bids for relatively large numbers of shipments for a period of one to two years and typically choose to enter into contractual arrangements with a limited number of motor carriers based upon price and service 

revenue is generated by customers dispersed primarily throughout the united states and north america in 2009 our largest customer accounted for approximately 29 of our revenue and our largest 5 10 and 20 customers accounted for approximately 89 140 and 210 of our revenue respectively for each of the previous three years at least 90 of our revenue was derived from transporting ltl shipments for our customers and less than 5 of our revenue was generated from international services we believe the diversity of our customer base helps protect our business from adverse developments in a single geographic region and the reduction or loss of business from a single customer 

seasonality 

our tonnage levels and revenue mix are subject to seasonal trends common in the motor carrier industry although other factors such as the economy could cause variation in these trends operating margins in the first quarter are normally lower due to reduced shipments during the winter months harsh winter weather can also adversely impact our performance by reducing demand and increasing operating expenses freight volumes typically build to a peak in the third quarter or early fourth quarter which generally results in improved operating margins for those periods 

in 2009 we experienced harsh winter weather during the first quarter that as expected negatively impacted our operating margins these negative impacts included increased operating costs resulting from inefficiencies in our service center network due to harsh winter weather as well as a reduction in demand primarily attributable to the ongoing effects of the recessionary economy subsequent to the first quarter of 2009 we experienced a seasonal build in freight that was consistent with our normal seasonal trends though the seasonal build was not as measurable as in prior years we believe seasonal trends will continue to impact our business however we anticipate that our tonnage trends may continue to be inconsistent with historical trends until there is a general improvement in the domestic economy 

technology 

we continually upgrade our technological capabilities and we provide access to our systems through multiple gateways that offer our customers maximum flexibility and immediate access to information we employ vehicle safety systems freight handling systems and logistics technology to reduce costs and transit times we continue to focus on the development and enhancement of the technology used in our operations in order to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of our services 

insurance 

we carry a significant amount of insurance with thirdparty insurance carriers and we selfinsure a portion of this risk we are currently selfinsured for bodily injury and property damage “bipd” claims up to 275 million per occurrence cargo loss and damage claims are selfinsured up to 100000 per occurrence we are 

  

exposed to workers’ compensation claims up to 10 million per occurrence through either selfinsurance or insurance deductibles we are insured for group health claims under a graduated aggregating policy where we are exposed to claims up to 350000 per occurrence plus an additional 235000 for claims exceeding 650000 our longterm disability claims are selfinsured to a maximum per individual of 3000 per month 

we believe that our policy of selfinsuring a portion of our risk together with our safety and loss prevention programs is an effective means of managing insurance costs we also believe that our current insurance coverage is adequate to cover our liability risks 

diesel fuel availability and cost 

our industry depends heavily upon the availability of diesel fuel although we maintained fuel storage and pumping facilities at 41 or 20 of our service center locations at december 31 2009 we may experience shortages at certain locations and may be forced to incur additional expense to ensure adequate supply on a timely basis to prevent a disruption to our service schedules as a result of higher diesel fuel costs we implemented a fuel surcharge program in august 1999 that has remained in effect since that time and has become one of many components in the overall price for our transportation services our fuel surcharges are generally indexed to the us department of energy’s the “doe” published fuel prices that reset each week our management believes that our operations and financial condition are susceptible to the same diesel fuel price increases or shortages as those of our competitors diesel fuel costs including fuel taxes totaled 114 and 168 of revenue in 2009 and 2008 respectively 

employees 

as of december 31 2009 we employed 9608 individuals on a fulltime basis of which none were represented under a collective bargaining agreement our fulltime employees work in the following roles 

 

 as of december 31 2009 we employed 2477 linehaul drivers and 2564 pd drivers on a fulltime basis all of our drivers are selected based upon safe driving records and experience each of our drivers is required to pass a drug test and have a current us department of transportation “dot” physical and a valid commercial driver’s license prior to employment once employed drivers are required to obtain and maintain hazardous materials endorsements to their commercial driver’s licenses drivers as well as all employees are required to take preemployment drug and alcohol tests and are randomly selected for periodic additional testing 

to help fulfill driver needs we offer qualified employees the opportunity to become drivers through the “old dominion driver training program” since its inception in 1988 2598 individuals have graduated from this program of the program graduates we have experienced an annual turnover rate of approximately 85 which is below our companywide average turnover rate of approximately 105 for drivers we believe our driver training and qualification programs have been important factors in improving our safety record and retaining our qualified drivers drivers with safe driving records are rewarded with bonuses of up to 3000 payable each year driver safety bonuses paid during 2009 and 2008 were 20 million in each year 

  

governmental regulation 

we are subject to regulation by the federal motor carrier safety administration the pipeline and hazardous materials safety agency and the surface transportation board which are agencies within the dot as well as the regulations of various state agencies these regulatory authorities have broad powers generally governing matters such as authority to engage in motor carrier operations motor carrier registration driver hours of service safety and fitness of transportation equipment and drivers certain mergers consolidations and acquisitions and periodic financial reporting in addition we are subject to compliance with cargosecurity and transportation regulations issued by the transportation security administration within the us department of homeland security 

the trucking industry is subject to regulatory and legislative changes from a variety of other governmental authorities which address matters such as i increasingly stringent environmental and occupational safety and health regulations ii limits on vehicle weight and size iii ergonomics and iv hours of service these changes may affect our business or the economics of our industry by requiring changes in operating practices or by influencing the demand for and increasing the costs of providing our services 

the cost of compliance with current applicable laws and regulations has not materially impacted our results of operations or financial condition however future changes to laws or regulations may adversely affect our operations and could result in unforeseen costs to our business 

environmental regulation 

we are subject to various federal state and local environmental laws and regulations that focus on among other things the emission and discharge of hazardous materials into the environment or their presence on or in our properties and vehicles fuel storage tanks transportation of certain materials and the discharge or retention of storm water under specific environmental laws we could also be held responsible for any costs relating to contamination at our past or present facilities and at thirdparty waste disposal sites as well as costs associated with cleanup of accidents involving our vehicles we do not believe that the cost of future compliance with current environmental laws or regulations will have a material adverse effect on our operations financial condition competitive position or capital expenditures for the remainder of fiscal year 2010 or fiscal year 2011 however future changes to laws or regulations may adversely affect our operations and could result in unforeseen costs to our business

 item 1a risk factors tableend various factors exist that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those projected in any forwardlooking statement in addition to the factors discussed elsewhere in this report we believe the following are some of the important risk factors that could materially affect our business financial condition or results of operations 

we operate in a highly competitive industry and our business will suffer if we are unable to adequately address potential downward pricing pressures and other factors that may adversely affect our operations and profitability 

numerous competitive factors could impair our ability to maintain our current profitability these factors include but are not limited to the following 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

 since the recessionary environment began many of our ltl competitors generally reduced their prices to address overcapacity and created a very aggressive pricing environment throughout the industry although we remain focused on maintaining our pricing philosophy of charging a fair and reasonable price for the high level of our service offerings the recessionary environment has had and could continue to have a negative impact on our operations and profitability 

if our employees were to unionize our operating costs would increase and our ability to compete would be impaired 

none of our employees are currently represented by a collective bargaining agreement however from time to time there have been efforts to organize our employees at various service centers we can offer no assurance that our employees will not unionize in the future particularly if regulatory changes occur that facilitate unionization 

the unionization of our employees could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations because 

 

  

   

  

  

 if we are unable to successfully execute our growth strategy our business and future results of operations may suffer 

our growth strategy includes increasing the volume of freight moving through our existing service center network selectively expanding our geographic footprint and broadening the scope of our service offerings in connection with our growth strategy at various times we have made selective acquisitions purchased additional equipment expanded and upgraded service centers and increased our sales and marketing efforts and we expect to continue to do so our growth strategy exposes us to a number of risks including the following 

 

  

  

  

  

  

 we cannot assure that we will overcome the risks associated with our growth strategy if we fail to overcome those risks we may not realize additional revenue or profits from our efforts we may incur additional expenses and therefore our financial position and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 

our customers and suppliers’ business may be impacted by a downturn in the economy andor a disruption of financial markets 

adverse economic conditions can negatively affect our customers’ business levels the amount of transportation services they need and their ability to pay for our services customers encountering adverse economic conditions may be unable to obtain additional financing or financing under acceptable terms due to disruptions in the capital and credit markets these customers represent a greater potential for bad debt losses which may require us to increase our reserve for bad debt economic conditions resulting in bankruptcies of one or more of our large customers could have a significant impact on our financial position results of operations or liquidity in a particular year or quarter 

our supplier’s business levels also may be negatively affected by adverse economic conditions or financial constraints which could lead to disruptions in the supply and availability of equipment parts and services critical to our operations a significant interruption in our normal supply chain could disrupt our operations increase our costs and negatively impact our ability to serve our customers 

  

insurance and claims expenses could significantly reduce our profitability 

we are exposed to claims related to cargo loss and damage property damage personal injury workers’ compensation longterm disability group health and dental we have insurance coverage with thirdparty insurance carriers but selfinsure a portion of the risk associated with these claims if the number or severity of claims for which we are selfinsured increases or we are required to accrue or pay additional amounts because the claims prove to be more severe than our original assessment our operating results would be adversely affected in addition insurance companies require us to obtain letters of credit to collateralize our selfinsured retention if these requirements increase our borrowing capacity could be adversely affected 

we have significant ongoing cash requirements that could limit our growth and affect our profitability if we are unable to obtain sufficient financing 

our business is highly capital intensive our purchases of property and equipment in 2009 and 2008 were 2109 million and 1815 million respectively we expect our net capital expenditures for 2010 to be approximately 95 million while we intend to finance expansion and renovation projects with existing cash cash flow from operations and available borrowings under our existing senior unsecured credit agreement we may require additional financing to support our continued growth if we are unable in the future to generate sufficient cash flow from operations or borrow the necessary capital to fund our planned capital expenditures we will be forced to limit our growth and operate our equipment for longer periods of time which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results 

in addition our business has significant operating cash requirements if our cash requirements are high or our cash flow from operations is low during particular periods we may need to seek additional financing which may be costly or difficult to obtain we have a 2250 million senior unsecured revolving credit facility that matures on august 10 2011 which we believe provides us with a sufficient source for borrowing as needed 

limited supply and increased prices for new equipment may adversely affect our earnings and cash flow 

investment in new equipment is a significant part of our annual capital expenditures we may face difficulty in purchasing new equipment due to decreased supply the price of our equipment may also be adversely affected in the future by regulations on newly manufactured tractors and diesel engines see the risk factor below entitled “we are subject to various environmental laws and regulations and costs of compliance with liabilities under or violations of existing or future environmental laws or regulations could adversely affect our business” 

a decrease in the demand and value of used equipment 

as we purchase new tractors as part of our normal replacement cycle each year we rely on the used equipment market to dispose of our older equipment oversupply in the transportation industry as well as adverse domestic and foreign economic conditions can negatively impact the demand for used tractors and therefore reduce the value we can obtain on our used equipment if we are unable to sell our replacement vehicles at or above salvage value the resulting losses could have a significant impact on our results of operations 

we may be adversely impacted by fluctuations in the price and availability of diesel fuel 

diesel fuel is a significant operating expense for our business we do not hedge against the risk of diesel fuel price increases an increase in diesel fuel prices or diesel fuel taxes or any change in federal or state regulations that results in such an increase could have a material adverse effect on our operating results unless the increase is offset by increases in freight rates or fuel surcharges charged to our customers depending on the base rate and fuel surcharge levels agreed upon by individual shippers a rapid and significant change in the cost of diesel fuel could also have a material adverse effect on our operating results we continuously monitor the components of our pricing including base freight rates and fuel surcharges and address individual account 

  

profitability issues with our customers when necessary while we have historically been able to adjust our base rate pricing andor fuel surcharges to offset changes to the cost of diesel fuel we cannot be certain that we will be able to do so in the future 

we maintained fuel storage and pumping facilities at 41 and 36 of our service center locations at december 31 2009 and 2008 respectively however we may experience shortages in the availability of diesel fuel at certain locations and may be forced to incur additional expense to ensure adequate supply on a timely basis to prevent a disruption to our service schedules an interruption in the supply of diesel fuel could have a material adverse effect on our operating results 

we are subject to various environmental laws and regulations and costs of compliance with liabilities under or violations of existing or future environmental laws or regulations could adversely affect our business 

we are subject to various federal state and local environmental laws and regulations that govern among other things the emission and discharge of hazardous materials into the environment the presence of hazardous materials at our properties or in our vehicles fuel storage tanks the transportation of certain materials and the discharge or retention of storm water under certain environmental laws we could also be held responsible for any costs relating to contamination at our past or present facilities and at thirdparty waste disposal sites as well as costs associated with the cleanup of accidents involving our vehicles environmental laws have become and are expected to continue to be increasingly more stringent over time and there can be no assurance that our costs of complying with current or future environmental laws or liabilities arising under such laws will not have a material adverse effect on our business operations or financial condition 

the us environmental protection agency the “epa” has issued regulations that require progressive reductions in exhaust emissions from diesel engines through 2010 beginning in october 2002 new diesel engines were required to meet these new emission limits some of the regulations required reductions in the sulfur content of diesel fuel beginning in june 2006 and the introduction of emissions aftertreatment devices on newlymanufactured engines and vehicles beginning with modelyear 2007 the final phase of the regulations requires reduced nitrogen and nonmethane hydrocarbon emissions beginning with modelyear 2010 these regulations have resulted in higher prices for tractors and diesel engines and increased fuel and maintenance costs and there can be no assurance that continued increases in pricing or costs will not have an adverse effect on our business and operations 

in addition to the epa regulations on exhaust emissions with which we must comply there is an increased regulatory focus on climate change and greenhouse gas emissions in the united states as a result we may become subject to additional legislation that could adversely impact our business at this time we cannot predict the requirements of any future regulations however any limitations on the emission of greenhouse gases or other environmental legislation could increase our future capital expenditures and have an adverse impact on our financial condition results of operations and liquidity 

we operate in a highly regulated industry and increased costs of compliance with or liability for violation of existing or future regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business 

we are regulated by the dot and by various state agencies these regulatory authorities have broad powers generally governing matters such as authority to engage in motor carrier operations as well as motor carrier registration driver hours of service safety and fitness of transportation equipment and drivers transportation of hazardous materials certain mergers and acquisitions and periodic financial reporting in addition the trucking industry is subject to regulatory and legislative changes from a variety of other governmental authorities which address matters such as i increasingly stringent environmental occupational safety and health regulations ii limits on vehicle weight and size iii ergonomics and iv hours of service in addition we are subject to compliance with cargosecurity and transportation regulations issued by the 

  

transportation security administration within the us department of homeland security regulatory requirements and changes in regulatory requirements may affect our business or the economics of the industry by requiring changes in operating practices or by influencing the demand for and increasing the costs of providing transportation services 

our results of operations may be affected by seasonal factors and harsh weather conditions 

our operations are subject to seasonal trends common in the trucking industry our operating margins in the first quarter are normally lower due to reduced demand during the winter months harsh weather can also adversely affect our performance by reducing demand and reducing our ability to transport freight which could result in decreased revenue and increased operating expenses 

if we are unable to retain our key employees our financial condition results of operations and liquidity could be adversely affected 

our success will continue to depend upon the experience and leadership of our key employees and executive officers in that regard the loss of the services of any of our key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operation and liquidity 

our principal shareholders control a large portion of our outstanding common stock 

earl e congdon john r congdon and members of their respective families beneficially own approximately onethird of the outstanding shares of our common stock as long as the congdon family controls a large portion of our voting stock they may be able to significantly influence the election of the entire board of directors and the outcome of all matters involving a shareholder vote the congdon family’s interests may differ from the interests of other shareholders 

our financial results may be adversely impacted by potential future changes in accounting practices 

future changes in accounting standards or practices and related legal and regulatory interpretations of those changes may adversely impact public companies in general the transportation industry or our operations specifically new accounting standards or requirements such as a conversion from us generally accepted accounting principles to international financial reporting standards could change the way we record revenues expenses assets andor liabilities or could be costly to implement these types of regulations could have a negative impact on our financial position liquidity results of operations andor access to capital 

our information technology systems are subject to certain risks that we cannot control 

our information systems including our accounting systems are dependent upon thirdparty software global communications providers telephone systems and other aspects of technology and internet infrastructure that are susceptible to failure although we have implemented redundant systems and network security measures our information technology remains susceptible to outages computer viruses breakins and similar disruptions that may inhibit our ability to provide services to our customers and the ability of our customers to access our systems this may result in the loss of customers or a reduction in demand for our services

 item 2 properties 

we own our general office located in thomasville north carolina consisting of a twostory office building of approximately 160000 square feet on 301 acres of land at december 31 2009 we operated 210 service centers of which 125 were owned and 85 were leased our service centers that are owned include most of our larger facilities and account for 777 of the total door capacity in our network we own all of our major breakbulk facilities which are listed below with the number of doors as of december 31 2009 

 

 these facilities are strategically dispersed over the states in which we operate at december 31 2009 the terms of our leased properties ranged from monthtomonth to a lease that expires in 2023 we believe that as current leases expire we will be able to renew them or find comparable facilities without incurring any material negative impact on service to our customers or our operating results 

we also own 25 nonoperating properties all of which are held for lease or are planned for future use seven of these properties are leased with lease terms that range from monthtomonth to a lease that expires in 2012 

we believe that all of our properties are in good repair and are capable of providing the level of service required by current business levels and customer demands in addition we believe we have sufficient capacity in our service center network to accommodate a substantial increase in demand for our services 




 item 3 legal proceedings 

we are involved in various legal proceedings and claims that have arisen in the ordinary course of our business that have not been fully adjudicated many of these are covered in whole or in part by insurance our management does not believe that these actions when finally concluded and determined will have a material adverse effect upon our financial position liquidity or results of operations

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations tableend overview 

we are a leading lessthantruckload “ltl” nonunion motor carrier providing regional interregional and national ltl service and valueadded logistics services from a single integrated organization we operate as one business segment and offer our products and services through our four branded product groups oddomestic odexpedited odglobal and odtechnology in addition to our ltl services we offer our 

  

customers a broad range of logistics services including ground and air expedited transportation supply chain consulting transportation management truckload brokerage container delivery and warehousing services through marketing and carrier relationships we also offer doortodoor international freight services to and from all of north america central america south america and the far east more than 90 of our revenue has historically been derived from transporting ltl shipments for our customers whose demand for our services is generally tied to industrial production and the overall health of the us domestic economy 

in analyzing the components of our revenue we monitor changes and trends in the following key metrics 

 

  

  

  

 our primary revenue focus is to increase shipment and tonnage growth within our existing infrastructure generally referred to as increasing density thereby maximizing asset utilization and labor productivity we measure density over many different functional areas of our operations including revenue per service center linehaul load factor pd stops per hour pd shipments per hour platform pounds handled per hour and platform shipments per hour in addition to our focus on density it is critical for us to obtain an appropriate yield on the shipments we handle we manage our yields by focusing on individual account profitability we believe yield management and improvements in density are key components in our ability to produce profitable growth 

our primary cost elements are direct wages and benefits associated with the movement of freight operating supplies and expenses which includes fuel and repair parts and depreciation of our equipment fleet and service center facilities we gauge our overall success in managing these costs by monitoring our operating ratio a measure of profitability calculated by dividing total operating expenses by revenue which also allows industrywide comparisons with our competition 

  

we continually upgrade our technological capabilities to improve our customer service and lower our operating costs our technology provides our customers with visibility of their shipments throughout our network increases the productivity of our workforce and provides key metrics from which we can monitor our processes 

results of operations 

the following table sets forth for the years indicated expenses and other items as a percentage of revenue from operations 

 

  

 2009 compared to 2008 

key financial and operating metrics for 2009 and 2008 are presented below 

 

   

our financial results for 2009 reflect our operating strengths as we remained profitable despite a significant decline in tonnage and revenue which resulted from the negative impacts of a recessionary economy and an increasingly competitive operating environment within the ltl industry the persistent recessionary economy caused freight demand to weaken throughout 2009 when combined with the overcapacity in the ltl industry the weakened demand created an aggressive and competitive pricing environment confronted with this environment and an 116 decline in tonnage we focused on delivering outstanding service performance improving the productivity of our employees managing our variable costs and remaining disciplined with the pricing for our services despite the success we had with these measures we were unable to sufficiently increase our prices or generate enough cost savings to offset our decline in revenue as a result our operating ratio increased to 943 in 2009 from 916 in 2008 and our earnings per diluted share decreased 489 to 094 for 2009 we believe our strategy mitigated much of the negative impact that we could have experienced as a result of the extremely difficult ltl operating environment since our operating ratio deteriorated by only 270 basis points despite a 190 decline in revenue 

revenue 

the decrease in revenue during 2009 was the result of decreases in tonnage and revenue per hundredweight of 116 and 85 respectively the reduction in tonnage during 2009 resulted from a 141 decrease in the number of shipments that was partially offset by a 29 increase in weight per shipment the tonnage decrease was primarily attributable to the impact of the recessionary economy on freight demand since our research indicates there has been no significant change in our market share although certain economic metrics indicate improvement and small amounts of capacity have exited the market we do not anticipate a change in industry conditions until there is a sustained recovery in the general domestic economy or a significant decrease in industry capacity resulting from potential business failures or consolidation in the ltl industry until one or both of these events occur we could experience additional declines in our tonnage and shipments as well as continued pressure on our yields however we believe we have positioned ourselves well through our commitment to service to gain additional market share from our existing customers and new customers who seek consistent claimsfree and valuedriven service once industry conditions improve 

revenue per hundredweight decreased 85 to 1270 from 1388 in 2008 this decrease in our revenue per hundredweight was primarily due to the reduction in fuel surcharge revenue which resulted from a significant decline in the average price of diesel fuel between the comparable years excluding fuel surcharges revenue per hundredweight remained consistent at 1149 for 2009 and 2008 we were unable to sufficiently increase our overall pricing during 2009 due to the competitive pricing environment in the ltl industry during the fourth quarter of 2008 and throughout 2009 pricing emerged as the principal driver of competition as many carriers attempted to either gain market share or minimize tonnage losses through price discounting despite the pricing pressure we remained committed to our pricing philosophy of charging our customers a fair and reasonable price for outstanding service our commitment to service is evidenced by an approximate 99 ontime service performance and a historically low cargo claims ratio during 2009 the prolonged impact of overcapacity in the industry and the aggressive competition on prices could continue to impact our ability to increase or even maintain our pricing in future periods which in turn could have a material adverse impact on our future revenue and net income 

fuel surcharge revenue decreased to 96 of revenue from 172 of revenue in 2008 most of our tariffs and contracts provide for a fuel surcharge which is recorded as additional revenue as diesel fuel prices increase above stated levels these levels are generally indexed to the doe’s published fuel prices that reset each week the fuel surcharge is one of many components included in the overall negotiated price for our transportation services with our customers although it is generally believed to be a measure of the increase in cost of all petroleum products that we use we continuously monitor the components of our pricing including base freight rates and fuel surcharges we also address individual account profitability issues with our customers when necessary as part of our effort to minimize the negative impact on our profitability that would likely result from a rapid and significant change in any of our operating expenses 

  

operating costs and other expenses 

salaries wages and benefits increased to 577 of revenue in 2009 from 523 in 2008 the increase as a percent of revenue is primarily due to the yearoveryear decline in fuel surcharge revenue which has no corresponding decrease in the volume of freight moving through our network as a result driver wages increased to 231 of revenue from 210 in 2008 platform wages as a percentage of revenue increased to 68 from 67 in 2008 

while our salaries wages and benefits increased as a percent of revenue the 859 million overall decrease is attributable to the 116 yearoveryear reduction in the total number of fulltime employees the decline in the number of hours worked and the overall increased productivity of our employees our pd shipments per hour increased 39 and pd stops per hour increased 34 both reflecting the improved efficiencies and utilization of our experienced drivers our linehaul laden load average increased 05 platform pounds handled per hour increased 93 which allowed our platform wages to remain consistent as a percent of revenue these productivity improvements partially offset the impact on our operating ratio of the annual wage increase provided to our driver and platform employees in september 2008 as well as the scheduled increases newly hired employees achieved in 2009 as they gained experience 

employee benefit costs increased to 334 of salaries and wages in 2009 from 301 in 2008 these increases are primarily attributable to increased costs associated with our group health and dental coverage and workers’ compensation claims experience group health and dental costs rose to 122 of total salary and wages in 2009 from 103 in 2008 due to an increase in the average cost of medical claims per employee as well as an increase in the number of claims paid for participants who elected coverage under the consolidated omnibus budget reconciliation act of 1985 “cobra” legislation passed in 2009 lengthened the period of coverage for eligible cobra participants who were involuntarily terminated between september 1 2008 and february 28 2010 

operating supplies and expenses decreased to 146 of revenue in 2009 from 199 in 2008 this decrease is primarily due to the decline in diesel fuel costs excluding fuel taxes which is the largest component of operating supplies and expenses these costs decreased 504 during the year as a result of the combined effect of a 373 decrease in our average price per gallon and a 128 decrease in gallons consumed the reduction in fuel consumption is primarily due to the yearoveryear decline in overall miles as well as a 22 increase in our miles per gallon the decreased consumption also lowered our fuel tax expenses and was the principal driver of the 25 million reduction in “operating taxes and licenses” we do not use diesel fuel hedging instruments and are therefore subject to market price fluctuations 

general supplies and expenses remained consistent as a percent of revenue at 29 for both 2009 and 2008 these costs remained consistent as a percent of revenue due to our strict cost control measures put in place to manage our variable costs and the decrease in supplies directly related to lower shipment volumes 

the decrease in insurance and claims expense to 18 of revenue from 23 in 2008 is attributable to the 321 and 390 decreases in auto liability and cargo claims expenses respectively we selfinsure a portion of our auto and cargo claims liabilities and obtain excess insurance coverage for claims above our retention levels the decrease in our auto liability expenses was primarily due to a 19 million favorable adjustment recorded in the fourth quarter that resulted from improved experience in the number of claims during 2009 and a reduction in our estimate for losses in prior years we believe that our cargo claims expense improved primarily due to the increased training of our employees on claims prevention which resulted in a historically low cargo claims ratio in 2009 and a 328 decrease in total claims paid 

depreciation and amortization expense increased to 76 of revenue in 2009 as compared to 57 in 2008 the increase as a percent of revenue reflects the combined impact of the decline in overall revenue in 2009 on these fixed costs and our significant investments in real estate and revenue equipment in 2008 and 2009 

  

consistent with our longterm growth strategy we took advantage of real estate opportunities during 2009 which allowed us not only to expand our service center network but also to relocate certain operations to larger facilities in addition we made a strategic decision to purchase new revenue equipment in 2009 while retaining the tractors and trailers scheduled to be replaced our decision to increase our equipment capacity placed us in a position to accommodate an increase in demand for our services that could have resulted from business failures or consolidation in the ltl industry that we believed were likely to result from the recessionary economy 

other expense net includes the net investment gains or losses on the cash value of our variable life insurance contracts related to our nonqualified deferred compensation plans the cash value of these contracts was impacted by the improvement in equity markets during 2009 which favorably affected comparisons with 2008 

our effective tax rate for 2009 and 2008 was 390 our effective tax rates in 2009 and 2008 were favorably impacted by alternative fuel tax credits for the use of propane in our operations these fuel tax credits expired on december 31 2009 and unless extended by future legislation will likely increase our effective tax rate in 2010 our effective tax rate exceeded the federal statutory rate of 35 primarily due to the impact of state taxes and certain nondeductible items 

2008 compared to 2007 

key financial and operating metrics for 2008 and 2007 are presented below 

 

 we remained true to our longterm strategy in 2008 by providing consistent ontime service maintaining price discipline and driving additional operating efficiencies into our processes despite one of the most challenging operating environments we have ever experienced we were faced with record high fuel prices in the first half of 2008 which contributed to the overall increase in our operating expenses as fuel prices began to decline the domestic economy slipped into a recession causing significant and further declines in tonnage for the industry as a result pricing emerged as a primary driver of competition while we maintained a commitment to our pricing philosophy and achieved productivity improvements these factors were not sufficient to overcome our increased operating expenses and the negative impact of the recessionary economy as a result our earnings per diluted share decreased 47 to 184 for 2008 and our operating ratio increased 90 basis points to 916 we believe our strategy of providing high service levels maintaining price discipline and aggressively managing costs proved to be the best course of action in the ltl marketplace in 2008 and minimized much of the negative impact on our financial performance caused by increased competition and the downward spiral of the economy 

despite the challenges in 2008 our revenue increased 97 to 154 billion which was driven by a 52 increase in total tonnage shipped and a 44 increase in revenue per hundredweight the 52 increase in tonnage shipped resulted from a 64 increase in weight per shipment that was partially offset by a 11 decrease in the number of shipments while an increase in weight per shipment is generally an indication of an 

  

improving economy we believe the increase in 2008 was more attributable to changes in customer shipping patterns as transportation costs increased we believe shippers were increasingly consolidating their shipments into larger units to ship less frequently at lower costs per hundredweight our mix of freight in 2008 reflects growth in truckload shipments spot quotes and container shipments all of which have an average higher weight per shipment 

we attribute our growth in tonnage primarily to increases in market share in our existing areas of operations while we increased the total number of service centers in our network to 206 at december 31 2008 from 192 at december 31 2007 over 95 of our revenue was produced from service centers open for more than one year although we experienced an overall increase in tonnage for 2008 freight demand weakened throughout the second half of the year and our tonnage declined 49 during the fourth quarter we believe that freight demand in the ltl industry will not improve until there is a general recovery in the domestic economy or a significant decrease in industry capacity as a result we experienced additional declines in our shipments and tonnage in 2009 

revenue per hundredweight increased 44 to 1388 from 1330 in 2007 revenue per hundredweight for 2008 reflects the impact of the general rate increase on our base rates and minimum charges for certain tariffs implemented on february 11 2008 as well as an increase in fuel surcharge revenue that resulted from the increase in the average price of diesel fuel during the year excluding fuel surcharges revenue per hundredweight decreased 14 in 2008 our revenue per hundredweight was also negatively impacted by the increase in weight per shipment as well as the 27 decline in the average length of haul 

the pricing environment in the ltl industry was extremely competitive throughout 2008 the competitiveness intensified in the second half of the year as the historical seasonal increase in freight volumes did not materialize as a result many carriers in our industry reduced their prices in an attempt to minimize declines in tonnage and shipment volumes although we increased the volume of freight moving through our service center network we did so while maintaining our basic pricing philosophy of evaluating each individual account for profitability in an effort to maintain rational pricing for our services we intend to maintain our disciplined approach to pricing by keeping our service at superior levels thus creating additional value to our customers we believe our rational and measured approach to the current pricing environment will be in our best longterm interest however a prolonged recession and competitive forces may result in some shortterm erosion in our pricing and shipment volumes which could have a material adverse impact on our revenue and net income 

fuel surcharge revenue increased to 172 of revenue from 124 in 2007 most of our tariffs and contracts provide for a fuel surcharge which is recorded as additional revenue as diesel fuel prices increase above stated levels these levels are generally indexed to the doe’s published fuel prices that reset each week the fuel surcharge is one of many components included in the overall negotiated price for our transportation services with our customers we continuously monitor the components of our pricing including base freight rates and fuel surcharges and address individual account profitability issues with our customers when necessary as part of our effort to minimize the negative impact on our profitability that would likely result from a rapid and significant change in any of our operating expenses 

salaries wages and benefits decreased to 523 of revenue in 2008 from 536 in 2007 while we were able to improve the productivity of our linehaul pd and platform operations the decrease as a percent of revenue primarily resulted from the overall increase in revenue the productivity improvements however helped minimize the impact of the annual general wage increase provided to our workforce in september 2007 and 2008 and the deleveraging effect of the fourth quarter decline in tonnage 

driver wages decreased to 210 of revenue in 2008 from 221 in 2007 we were able to effectively match our labor with the changes in shipment volume during the year while also improving our productivity in our linehaul operations we increased our laden load average 18 pd shipments per hour and pd stops per 

  

hour increased 23 and 07 respectively platform wages decreased to 67 of revenue from 73 in 2007 platform pounds handled per hour increased 104 primarily as a result of the increase in weight per shipment 

employee benefit costs increased to 301 of salaries and wages in 2008 from 285 in 2007 the increase is attributable to rising group health and dental costs which increased to 103 of total salary and wages in 2008 from 91 and increased costs associated with our paid time off for employees we experienced an increase in the severity of our health claims in 2008 which resulted in a 163 increase in claim payments as compared to 2007 

operating supplies and expenses increased to 199 of revenue in 2008 from 170 in 2007 this increase is primarily due to the significant rise in diesel fuel costs excluding fuel taxes which is the largest component of operating supplies and expenses these costs increased 372 during the year as a result of a significant increase in the price of diesel fuel and to a lesser extent a 02 increase in gallons consumed we were able to minimize our consumption of fuel in 2008 by implementing several initiatives designed to improve our miles per gallon we do not use diesel fuel hedging instruments and are therefore subject to market price fluctuations 

depreciation and amortization remained consistent at 57 of revenue for both 2008 and 2007 we continued to make significant investments in our service center network and revenue equipment in 2008 we purchased eleven service centers and also completed several expansion projects to existing service centers to increase the overall capacity of our service center network we reduced our capital expenditures for revenue equipment in 2008 as compared to our purchases in recent years to appropriately match our fleet size with freight demands we also incurred an increase in building and office equipment rents to 09 of revenue from 08 for 2007 due to an increase in both the number and size of leased facilities 

other expense net increased to 02 of revenue from 01 of revenue in 2007 the increase reflects the decline in the cash value of our variable life insurance contracts related to company’s nonqualified deferred compensation plans the cash value of these contracts was unfavorably impacted by the decline in equity markets during 2008 

our effective tax rate for 2008 was 390 compared to 380 in 2007 our effective tax rate was lower in 2007 as a result of the favorable impact of alternative fuel tax credits for the use of propane in our operations that we became eligible for in 2007 and to a lesser extent the resolution of various state tax matters in the first quarter of 2007 that decreased our liability for unrecognized tax benefits we expect the alternative fuel tax credits will continue to favorably impact our effective tax rate until these credits are no longer available our effective tax rate exceeded the federal statutory rate of 35 primarily due to the impact of state taxes and certain nondeductible items 

liquidity and capital resources 

a summary of our cash flows is presented below 

 

   

we have two primary sources of available liquidity to fund our estimated capital expenditures cash flows from operations and available borrowings under our senior unsecured revolving credit agreement which is described below we believe we also have sufficient access to debt and equity markets to provide another source of liquidity if needed to facilitate our access to the equity market we filed an automatic shelf registration statement with the sec during the fourth quarter of 2009 that provides us with the opportunity to offer and sell shares of common stock on a delayed or continuous basis at indeterminate prices from time to time at december 31 2009 cash and shortterm investments decreased to 42 million from 290 million at december 31 2008 primarily due to the liquidation of 246 million held in money market funds and shortterm investments to help fund our capital expenditures during 2009 

capital expenditures 

the table below sets forth our net capital expenditures for property and equipment including those obtained through acquisition of business assets and capital leases for the years ended december 31 2009 2008 and 2007 

 

 our capital expenditure requirements are generally based upon the expansion in the number and size of service center facilities to support our plan for longterm growth our planned tractor and trailer replacement cycle and forecasted revenue growth despite weak economic conditions in 2009 we continued the planned expansion of our service center network and took advantage of favorable real estate opportunities that support our longterm growth objectives we also made a strategic decision to execute our normal equipment replacement cycle while retaining tractors scheduled to be replaced by increasing our fleet and service center capacity during 2009 we believe we are wellpositioned to take advantage of any increase in demand for our services caused by improvements in the economy potential business failures or consolidation in the ltl industry while our purchase of additional equipment in 2009 increased our depreciation expenses during the year it should in turn result in reduced capital expenditures for equipment in 2010 

we anticipate that there will be additional environmental regulations and legislation resulting from the increased regulatory focus on climate change and greenhouse gas emissions in the united states at this time we cannot predict the requirements of any future regulations however any limitations on the emission of greenhouse gases or other environmental legislation could increase our future capital expenditures and have an adverse impact on our financial condition results of operations and liquidity 

in 2009 we invested 2109 million in the purchase of property and equipment cash flows from operations and the liquidation of 246 million held in money market funds and shortterm investments at december 31 2008 funded approximately 737 of our capital expenditures in 2009 the remainder of these expenditures was funded through the use of our senior unsecured revolving credit facility our capital expenditures for tractors and trailers in 2009 and 2007 were significantly higher than 2008 because in 2008 we were able to effectively utilize our existing fleet to meet our freight demands as a result our purchases in 2008 were limited to replacing a portion of the equipment being retired through the normal replacement cycle in 2009 and 2007 however we both replaced equipment and increased capacity to support our anticipated growth and geographic expansion 

  

we currently project capital expenditures net of anticipated proceeds from dispositions to be approximately 95 million for the year ending december 31 2010 of our capital expenditures approximately 50 million is allocated for the purchase of service center facilities construction of new service center facilities or expansion of existing service center facilities approximately 25 million is allocated for the purchase of tractors and trailers to replace equipment at the end of its useful life and approximately 16 million is allocated for investments in technology we expect to fund a substantial majority of these capital expenditures through cash flows from operations and the use of our senior unsecured revolving credit facility if necessary 

financing agreements 

we have a 2250 million senior unsecured revolving credit facility pursuant to the terms of an amended and restated credit agreement that matures on august 10 2011 the “credit agreement” wachovia bank national association “wachovia” serves as administrative agent for the lenders which also include bank of america na branch banking and trust company suntrust bank us bank national association and high point bank and trust company of the 2250 million line of credit commitments 1500 million may be used for letters of credit and 150 million may be used for borrowings under wachovia’s sweep program the sweep program is a daily cash management tool that automatically initiates borrowings to cover overnight cash requirements up to an aggregate of 150 million or initiates overnight investments for excess cash balances in addition we have the right to request an increase in the line of credit commitments up to a total of 3000 million in minimum increments of 250 million at our option revolving loans under the facility bear interest at either i the higher of wachovia’s prime rate or the federal funds rate plus 05 per annum ii libor one two three or six months plus an applicable margin “adjusted libor rate” or iii onemonth libor plus an applicable margin “libor index rate” the applicable margin is determined by a pricing grid in the credit agreement and ranges from 05 to 1125 the applicable margin for the credit agreement in 2009 was 0625 revolving loans under the sweep program bear interest at the libor index rate 

the credit agreement contains customary covenants including financial covenants that require us to observe a maximum ratio of debt to total capital and a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio any future whollyowned subsidiaries of old dominion would be required to guarantee payment of all of our obligations under the facility the amounts outstanding and remaining borrowing capacity under our credit agreement are presented below 

 

 commitment fees ranging from 01 to 0225 are charged quarterly in arrears on the aggregate unutilized portion of the credit agreement letter of credit fees equal to the applicable margin for adjusted libor rate loans are charged quarterly in arrears on the daily average aggregate stated amount of all letters of credit outstanding during the quarter the commitment fees and letter of credit fees were 0125 and 0625 respectively for the credit agreement in 2009 in addition a facing fee at an annual rate of 0125 is charged quarterly in arrears on the daily average aggregate stated amount of all letters of credit outstanding during such quarter 

we have two unsecured senior note agreements outstanding totaling 2393 million at december 31 2009 these notes call for periodic principal payments with maturities in 2015 and 2016 of which 357 million is due in the next twelve months interest rates on these notes are fixed at 468 and 585 the effective average interest rate on our outstanding senior note agreements was 554 and 550 at december 31 2009 and 2008 respectively 

  

with the exception of borrowings pursuant to the credit agreement interest rates are fixed on all of our debt instruments therefore shortterm exposure to fluctuations in interest rates is limited to our line of credit facility we do not currently use interest rate derivative instruments to manage exposure to interest rate changes 

our credit agreement limits the amount of dividends that could be paid to shareholders to the greater of i 100 million ii the amount of dividends paid in the immediately preceding fiscal year or iii an amount equal to 25 of net income from the immediately preceding fiscal year we did not declare or pay a dividend on our common stock in 2009 or 2008 and we have no plans to declare or pay a dividend in 2010 

a significant decrease in demand for our services could limit our ability to generate cash flow and affect profitability most of our debt agreements have covenants that require stated levels of financial performance which if not achieved could cause acceleration of the payment schedules as of december 31 2009 we were in compliance with these covenants despite current macroeconomic conditions we do not anticipate a significant decline in business levels or financial performance that would cause us to violate any such covenants in the future and we believe the combination of our existing credit agreement along with our additional borrowing capacity will be sufficient to meet foreseeable seasonal and longterm capital needs 

contractual obligations 

the following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations as of december 31 2009 

 

  

 critical accounting policies 

in preparing our financial statements we apply the following critical accounting policies that we believe affect our judgments and estimates of amounts recorded in certain assets liabilities revenue and expenses these critical accounting policies are further described in note 1 of the notes to the financial statements included in item 8 of this report 

revenue recognition 

we recognize revenue based upon when our transportation services have been completed in accordance with the bill of lading contract our general tariff provisions or contractual agreements with our customers generally this occurs when we complete the delivery of a shipment for transportation services not completed at the end of a reporting period we use a percentage of completion method to allocate the appropriate revenue to each separate reporting period under this method we develop a factor for each uncompleted shipment by dividing the actual 

  

number of days in transit at the end of a reporting period by that shipment’s standard delivery time schedule this factor is applied to the total revenue for that shipment and revenue is allocated between reporting periods accordingly 

allowances for uncollectible accounts and revenue adjustments 

we maintain an allowance for uncollectible accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments we estimate this allowance by analyzing the aging of our customer receivables our historical loss experience and other trends and factors affecting the credit risk of our customers we determine customer receivables to be past due when payment has not been received by the invoice due date writeoffs occur when we determine an account to be uncollectible and could differ from our allowance estimate as a result of factors such as changes in the overall economic environment or risks surrounding our customers additional allowances may be required if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments we periodically review the underlying assumptions in our estimate of the allowance for uncollectible accounts to ensure that the allowance reflects the most recent trends and factors 

we also maintain an allowance for revenue adjustments resulting from billing corrections customer allowances moneyback service guarantees and other miscellaneous revenue adjustments these revenue adjustments are recorded in our revenue from operations we use historical experience trends and current information to update and evaluate these estimates 

management believes the methodologies for estimating these allowances to be reliable based on the accuracy of our estimates in prior periods as such we do not anticipate any nearterm changes in our methodologies for these estimates 

claims and insurance accruals 

claims and insurance accruals reflect the estimated cost of claims for cargo loss and damage bipd workers’ compensation longterm disability group health and group dental not covered by insurance the related costs are charged to insurance and claims expense except for workers’ compensation longterm disability group health and group dental which are charged to employee benefits expense 

insurers providing excess coverage above retention levels adjust their premiums to cover insured losses and for other market factors as a result we periodically evaluate our selfinsured retention levels to determine the most costefficient balance between selfinsurance and excess coverage 

in establishing accruals for claims and insurance expenses we evaluate and monitor each claim individually and we use factors such as historical claims development experience known trends and thirdparty estimates to determine the appropriate reserves for potential liability we believe the assumptions and methods used to estimate these liabilities are reasonable however any changes in the severity of previouslyreported claims significant changes in the medical costs and regulatory changes affecting the administration of our plans could significantly impact the determination of appropriate reserves in future periods 

property and equipment 

property and equipment are recorded at cost and depreciated on a straightline basis over their estimated economic lives management uses historical experience certain assumptions and estimates in determining the economic life of each asset periodically we review property and equipment for impairment due to changes in operational and market conditions and we adjust the carrying value and economic life of any impaired asset as appropriate currently estimated economic lives for structures are 7 to 30 years revenue equipment is 4 to 12 years other equipment is 2 to 20 years and leasehold improvements are the lesser of the economic life of the 

  

leasehold improvement or the remaining life of the lease the use of different assumptions estimates or significant changes in the resale market for our equipment could result in material changes in the carrying value and related depreciation of our assets 

inflation 

most of our expenses are affected by inflation which generally results in increased operating costs in response to fluctuations in the cost of petroleum products particularly diesel fuel we generally include a fuel surcharge in our tariffs and contractual agreements the fuel surcharge is designed to offset the cost of diesel fuel above a base price and increases as diesel fuel prices escalate over the base which is generally indexed to the doe’s published fuel prices that reset each week volatility in the price of diesel fuel independent of inflation has impacted our business as described in this report however we do not believe inflation has had a material effect on our results of operations for each of the past three years 

related person transactions 

family relationships 

each of earl e congdon john r congdon david s congdon john r congdon jr and john b yowell are related to one another and serve in various executive management positions andor on our board of directors in addition earl e congdon john r congdon john r congdon jr and john b yowell each beneficially own individually or together with family members approximately 5 or more of our common stock at december 31 2009 in 2008 we entered into amended and restated employment agreements with earl e congdon john r congdon david s congdon and john b yowell which are incorporated by reference as exhibits to our annual report on form 10k we regularly disclose the amount of compensation that we pay to these individuals in the proxy statement for our annual meeting of shareholders 

transactions with old dominion truck leasing inc 

old dominion truck leasing inc “leasing” is a north carolina corporation whose voting stock is owned by an earl e congdon trust the john r congdon revocable trust and members of earl e congdon’s and john r congdon’s families leasing is primarily engaged in the business of purchasing and leasing tractors trailers and other vehicles john r congdon is chairman of the board of leasing and earl e congdon is vice chairman of the board of leasing since 1986 we have combined our requirements with leasing for the purchase of tractors trailers equipment parts tires and fuel we believe that the termination of this arrangement would not have a material adverse impact on our financial results 

for the years ended december 31 2008 and 2007 we charged leasing 11000 and 4000 respectively for vehicle repair maintenance and other services we provide to leasing at cost plus a negotiated markup for the year ended december 31 2009 we did not provide such services to leasing we also charged leasing 12000 12000 and 1000 for the rental of a service center facility in 2009 2008 and 2007 respectively in 2008 we sold leasing equipment at its fair market value of 33000 

we purchased 231000 260000 and 257000 of maintenance and other services from leasing in 2009 2008 and 2007 respectively we believe that the prices we pay for such services are lower than would be charged by unaffiliated third parties for the same quality of work and we intend to continue to purchase maintenance and other services from leasing provided that leasing’s prices continue to be favorable to us 

we also paid leasing 114000 257000 and 588000 for leased equipment in 2009 2008 and 2007 respectively our lease payments in 2009 and 2008 were for longterm leases for tractors available for use in our linehaul operations these leases expire in january 2011 in 2007 the leased equipment was primarily utilized by our customers who reimbursed us for the lease amount through a periodic billing process that included charges 

  

for additional services we provided to these customers we believe these leasing agreements are at arm’s length and we received no commission or other financial benefit from leasing or any other party in connection with these lease transactions 

split dollar life insurance policies 

we are the owner of two splitdollar life insurance contracts insuring the life of john r congdon the net cash surrender value for these policies was 25 million and 24 million at december 31 2009 and 2008 respectively and is included on our balance sheets under the caption “other assets” these policies provided for an aggregate of 48 million in net death benefits due to the company at december 31 2009 of which we have endorsed 20 million to the estate of mr congdon’s spouse

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact our financial position results of operations and cash flows due to adverse changes in financial market prices and rates 

we are exposed to interest rate risk directly related to loans under our credit agreement which have variable interest rates the average principal balance and the effective annual interest rate under the revolving credit agreement for 2009 were 525 million and 217 respectively a 100 basis point increase in the average interest rate on this agreement would have a 05 million impact on our operating results we have established policies and procedures to manage exposure to market risks and use major institutions that we believe are creditworthy to minimize credit risk 

we are exposed to market risk for equity investments relating to companyowned life insurance contracts on certain employees at december 31 2009 the cash value for variable life insurance contracts was 124 million of the total 179 million of cash values for all life insurance contracts included on our balance sheets in “other assets” variable life insurance contracts expose us to fluctuations in equity markets however we utilize a thirdparty to manage these assets and minimize that exposure a 10 change in market value in those investments would have a 12 million impact on our operating income 

we are also exposed to commodity price risk related to diesel fuel prices and manage our exposure to that risk primarily through the application of fuel surcharges

 item 1 business 

unless the context requires otherwise references in this report to “old dominion” the “company” “we” “us” and “our” refer to old dominion freight line inc 

general 

old dominion is a leading nonunion lessthantruckload “ltl” motor carrier providing multiregional service among six regions in the united states and nextday and secondday service within each of these regions we operate as one business segment and offer an expanding array of innovative products and services through our four branded product groups oddomestic odexpedited odglobal and odtechnology with direct service to 48 states within the southeast gulf coast northeast midwest central and west regions of the country we plan to continue to expand our service center network as opportunities arise to complete our fullstate coverage throughout the continental united states we expect the additional service centers necessary to achieve this goal will provide a platform for future growth and help ensure that our service center network has sufficient capacity in addition to our domestic ltl services we offer container delivery services to and from all of north america central america south america and the far east we also offer a broad range of expedited logistical and warehousing services for both our domestic and global markets 

we have grown substantially through both strategic acquisitions and internal growth prior to 1995 we provided interregional service to major metropolitan areas from and regional service within the southeast region of the united states since 1995 we have expanded our infrastructure to provide nextday and secondday service within five additional regions as well as expanded interregional service among those regions from 1995 through december 31 2008 we increased our number of service centers from 53 to 206 and our states directly served from 21 to 48 we believe that our present infrastructure will enable us to increase freight density which is the volume of freight moving through our network and thereby improve our profitability 

we are committed to providing our customers with high quality and valuedriven service we provide consistent customer service from a single organization offering our customers information and pricing from one 

  

point of contact our multiregional competitors that offer interregional service typically do so through independent companies or with separate points of contact within different operating segments which can result in inconsistent service and pricing as well as poor shipment visibility our integrated structure allows us to offer our customers consistent and continuous service across all areas of our operations and for each of our service products 

old dominion was founded in 1934 and incorporated in virginia in 1950 our principal executive offices are at 500 old dominion way thomasville north carolina 27360 please refer to the balance sheets and statements of operations included in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” of this report for information regarding our total assets revenue from operations and net income 

our industry 

trucks provide transportation services to virtually every industry operating in the united states and generally offer higher levels of reliability and faster transit times than other surface transportation options the trucking industry is comprised principally of two types of motor carriers truckload and ltl truckload carriers generally provide an entire trailer to one customer from origin to destination ltl carriers pick up multiple shipments from multiple customers on a single truck and then route those shipments through service centers where freight may be transferred to other trucks with similar destinations for delivery 

in contrast to truckload carriers ltl motor carriers require expansive networks of local pickup and delivery “pd” service centers as well as larger breakbulk or hub facilities the significant capital that ltl motor carriers must commit to create and maintain a network of service centers and a fleet of tractors and trailers makes it difficult for startup or small operations to effectively compete with established companies in addition successful ltl motor carriers generally employ and continuously update a high level of technology to provide information to customers and to reduce operating costs 

service center operations 

at december 31 2008 we conducted operations through 206 service center locations of which we own 108 and lease 98 we operate major breakbulk facilities in atlanta georgia rialto california indianapolis indiana greensboro north carolina harrisburg pennsylvania memphis and morristown tennessee and dallas texas while using some smaller service centers for limited breakbulk activity in order to serve our nextday markets our service centers are strategically located in six regions of the country to provide the highest quality service and minimize freight rehandling costs 

each of our service centers is responsible for the pickup and delivery of freight within its service area each service center loads outbound freight by destination the day it is picked up all inbound freight received by the service center in the evening or during the night is scheduled for local delivery the next business day unless a customer requests a different delivery schedule our management reviews the productivity and service performance of each service center on a daily basis to ensure quality service and efficient operations 

while we have established primary responsibility for customer service at the local service center level our customers may access information and initiate transactions through our centralized customer service department located at our corporate office or several other gateways such as our web site electronic data interchange “edi” automated voice response systems and automated fax systems our systems offer direct access to information such as freight tracking shipping documents rate quotes rate databases and account activity these centralized systems and our customer service department provide our customers with a single point of contact to access information across all areas of our operations and for each of our service products 

linehaul transportation 

linehaul dispatchers are centralized at our corporate office and control the movement of freight among service centers through integrated freight movement systems we also utilize loadplanning software to optimize 

  

efficiencies in our linehaul operations our senior management continuously monitors freight movements transit times load factors and other productivity measurements to ensure that we maintain our highest levels of service and efficiency 

we utilize scheduled routes and additional linehaul dispatches as necessary to meet our published service standards in addition we lower our cost structure by maintaining flexible workforce rules and by primarily using twin 28foot trailers in our linehaul operations the use of twin 28foot trailers permits us to transport freight directly from its point of origin to destination with minimal unloading and reloading which also reduces cargo loss and damage expenses we also utilize longcombination vehicles such as triple 28foot trailers and combinations of 48foot and 28foot trailers in states where permitted twin trailers and longcombination vehicles permit more freight to be hauled behind a tractor than could otherwise be hauled by one large trailer 

tractors trailers and maintenance 

at december 31 2008 we owned 5058 tractors we generally use new tractors in linehaul operations for approximately three to five years and then transfer those tractors to pd operations for the remainder of their useful lives in many of our service centers tractors perform pd functions during the day and linehaul functions at night to maximize tractor utilization 

at december 31 2008 we operated a fleet of 20067 trailers we primarily purchase new trailers for our operations however we occasionally purchase preowned equipment meeting our specifications from other trucking companies 

at various times we have also acquired tractors and trailers through our acquisition of business assets from other carriers the purchase of preowned equipment can provide an excellent value but can increase our fleet’s average age the table below reflects as of december 31 2008 the average age of our tractors and trailers 

 

 we develop certain specifications for tractors and trailers and then negotiate the production and purchase of this equipment with several manufacturers these purchases are planned well in advance of anticipated delivery dates in order to accommodate manufacturers’ production schedules we believe that there is sufficient capacity among suppliers to ensure an uninterrupted supply of equipment to support our operations 

the table below sets forth our capital expenditures for tractors and trailers for the years ended december 31 2008 2007 and 2006 our capital expenditures for tractors and trailers in 2008 were lower than 2007 and 2006 as we were able to effectively utilize our existing fleet in 2008 to meet our freight demands as a result our purchases were limited to replacing a portion of the equipment being retired through the normal replacement cycle as compared to the capital expenditures in 2007 and 2006 when we both replaced equipment and increased capacity to support our growth and geographic expansion 

 

   

at december 31 2008 we had major maintenance operations at our service centers in rialto california denver colorado atlanta georgia indianapolis indiana kansas city and parsons kansas greensboro north carolina columbus ohio harrisburg pennsylvania morristown and memphis tennessee dallas texas and salt lake city utah in addition seventeen other service center locations are equipped to perform routine and preventive maintenance and repairs on our equipment 

we adhere to established maintenance policies and procedures to ensure our fleet is properly maintained linehaul tractors are routed to appropriate maintenance facilities at designated mileage or time intervals depending upon how the equipment was utilized pd tractors and trailers are scheduled for maintenance every 90 days 

marketing and customers 

at december 31 2008 we had a sales staff of 461 employees we compensate our sales force in part based upon ontime service performance revenue generated and company and service center profitability which we believe helps motivate our employees to achieve our service growth and profitability objectives 

we utilize a computerized freightcosting model to determine the price level at which a particular shipment of freight will be profitable we can modify elements of this freightcosting model to simulate the actual conditions under which the freight will be moved we also compete for business by participating in bid solicitations customers generally solicit bids for relatively large numbers of shipments for a period of one to two years and typically choose to enter into contractual arrangements with a limited number of motor carriers based upon price and service 

revenue is generated from many customers and locations primarily across the united states and north america in 2008 our largest customer accounted for approximately 27 of our revenue and our largest 5 10 and 20 customers accounted for approximately 54 104 and 165 of our revenue respectively for each of the previous three years more than 90 of our revenue was derived from transporting ltl shipments for our customers and less than 5 of our revenue was generated from international services we believe the diversity of our revenue base helps protect our business from adverse developments in a single geographic region and the reduction or loss of business from a single customer for information concerning total revenue for each of the last three fiscal years see item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” 

competition 

the transportation industry is highly competitive on the basis of both price and service at december 31 2008 we were the sixth largest ltl carrier in the united states as measured by revenue we compete with regional interregional and national ltl carriers and to a lesser extent with truckload carriers small package carriers airfreight carriers and railroads competition is based primarily on service price and business relationships we believe that we are able to compete effectively in our markets by providing highquality and timely service at competitive prices 

we believe our transit times are generally faster than those of our principal national competitors we believe this performance is due primarily to our more efficient service center network use of team drivers and investment in technology in addition we provide greater geographic coverage than most of our regional competitors our diversified mix and scope of regional and interregional services enable us to provide our customers with a single source to meet their ltl shipping needs and we believe this provides us with a distinct advantage over our regional multiregional and national competition 

we also believe we have a significant advantage over our unionized ltl competition advantages provided by our nonunion operations include flexible work schedules and the ability of our employees to perform multiple tasks which we believe result in greater productivity customer service efficiency and cost savings 

  

we compete with several larger transportation service providers each of which may have more equipment a broader coverage network and a wider range of services than we have our larger competitors may also have greater financial resources and in general the ability to reduce prices to gain business especially during times of reduced growth rates in the economy this could potentially limit our ability to maintain or increase prices and could also limit our growth in shipments and tonnage 

seasonality 

our tonnage levels and revenue mix are subject to seasonal trends common in the motor carrier industry operating margins in the first quarter are normally lower due to reduced shipments during the winter months harsh winter weather can also adversely impact our performance by reducing demand and increasing operating expenses freight volumes typically build to a peak in the third quarter and early fourth quarter which generally results in improved operating margins for those periods this typical build in freight volumes did not occur in 2008 due to the economic downturn which increased the competitiveness of our industry 

technology 

we continually upgrade our technological capabilities and we provide access to our systems through multiple gateways that offer our customers maximum flexibility and immediate access to information we employ vehicle safety systems freight handling systems and logistics technology to reduce costs and transit times our principal technologies include 

 

  

  

  

  

  

   

  

  

 insurance 

we carry a significant amount of insurance with thirdparty insurance carriers and we selfinsure a portion of this risk we are currently selfinsured for bodily injury and property damage claims up to 2750000 per occurrence cargo loss and damage claims are selfinsured up to 100000 per occurrence we are responsible for workers’ compensation claims up to 1000000 per occurrence through either selfinsurance or insurance deductibles group health claims are selfinsured up to 325000 per occurrence and longterm disability claims are selfinsured to a maximum per individual of 3000 per month 

we believe that our policy of selfinsuring a portion of our risk together with our safety and loss prevention programs is an effective means of managing insurance costs we also believe that our current insurance coverage is adequate to cover our liability risks 

diesel fuel availability and cost 

our industry depends heavily upon the availability of diesel fuel although we maintain fuel storage and pumping facilities at 36 of our service center locations we may experience shortages at certain locations and may be forced to incur additional expense to ensure adequate supply on a timely basis to prevent a disruption to our service schedules as a result of higher diesel fuel costs we implemented a fuel surcharge program in august 1999 that has remained in effect since that time and has become one of many components in the overall price for our transportation services our fuel surcharges are generally indexed to the us department of energy’s the “doe” published fuel prices that reset each week our management believes that our operations and financial condition are susceptible to the same diesel fuel price increases or shortages as those of our competitors diesel fuel costs including fuel taxes totaled 168 and 141 of revenue in 2008 and 2007 respectively 

employees 

as of december 31 2008 we employed 10864 individuals on a fulltime basis in the following categories 

 

   

as of december 31 2008 we employed 2788 linehaul drivers and 2822 pd drivers on a fulltime basis all of our drivers are selected based upon safe driving records and experience each of our drivers is required to pass a drug test and have a current us department of transportation “dot” physical and a valid commercial driver’s license prior to employment once employed drivers are required to obtain and maintain hazardous materials endorsements to their commercial driver’s licenses drivers are also required to take drug and alcohol tests by random selection 

to help fulfill driver needs we offer qualified employees the opportunity to become drivers through the “old dominion driver training program” since its inception in 1988 2551 individuals have graduated from this program from which we have experienced an annual turnover rate of approximately 10 we believe our driver training and qualification programs have been important factors in improving our safety record drivers with safe driving records are rewarded with bonuses payable each year driver safety bonuses paid during 2008 and 2007 were 2035000 and 1154000 respectively we increased this incentive for our drivers in 2008 by raising the maximum bonus amount from 1000 to 3000 

our focus on communication and the continued education development and motivation of our employees helps to ensure that we maintain an excellent relationship with our employees there are no employees represented under a collective bargaining agreement which we believe is an important factor in our continued success 

governmental regulation 

we are subject to regulation by the federal motor carrier safety administration the pipeline and hazardous materials safety agency and the surface transportation board which are agencies within the dot as well as the regulations of various state agencies these regulatory authorities have broad powers generally governing matters such as authority to engage in motor carrier operations motor carrier registration driver hours of service safety and fitness of transportation equipment and drivers certain mergers consolidations and acquisitions and periodic financial reporting in addition we are subject to compliance with cargosecurity and transportation regulations issued by the transportation security administration within the us department of homeland security 

the trucking industry is subject to regulatory and legislative changes from a variety of other governmental authorities which address matters such as i increasingly stringent environmental and occupational safety and health regulations ii limits on vehicle weight and size iii ergonomics and iv hours of service these changes may affect our business or the economics of our industry by requiring changes in operating practices or by influencing the demand for and increasing the costs of providing our services 

the cost of compliance with applicable laws and regulations has not materially impacted our results of operations or financial condition and we believe that this will continue to be the case 

environmental regulation 

we are subject to various federal state and local environmental laws and regulations that focus on among other things the emission and discharge of hazardous materials into the environment or their presence on or in our properties and vehicles fuel storage tanks transportation of certain materials and the discharge or retention of storm water under specific environmental laws we could also be held responsible for any costs relating to contamination at our past or present facilities and at thirdparty waste disposal sites we do not believe that the cost of future compliance with environmental laws or regulations will have a material adverse effect on our operations financial condition competitive position or capital expenditures for the remainder of fiscal year 2009 or fiscal year 2010

 item 1a risk factors tableend various factors exist that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those projected in any forwardlooking statement in addition to the factors discussed elsewhere in this report we believe the following are some of the important risk factors that could materially affect our business financial condition or results of operations 

we operate in a highly competitive industry and our business will suffer if we are unable to adequately address potential downward pricing pressures and other factors that may adversely affect our operations and profitability 

numerous competitive factors could impair our ability to maintain our current profitability these factors include but are not limited to the following 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

 if our employees were to unionize our operating costs would increase and our ability to compete would be impaired 

none of our employees are currently represented by a collective bargaining agreement however from time to time there have been efforts to organize our employees at various service centers we can offer no assurance that our employees will not unionize in the future particularly if legislation is passed that facilitates unionization such as the employee free choice act “efca” 

  

the unionization of our employees could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations because 

 

  

  

  

  

 if we are unable to successfully execute our growth strategy our business and future results of operations may suffer 

our growth strategy includes increasing the volume of freight moving through our existing service center network selectively expanding our geographic footprint and broadening the scope of our service offerings in connection with our growth strategy at various times we have purchased additional equipment expanded and upgraded service centers hired additional personnel and increased our sales and marketing efforts and we expect to continue to do so our growth strategy exposes us to a number of risks including the following 

 

  

  

  

  

  

 we cannot assure that we will overcome the risks associated with our growth if we fail to overcome those risks we may not realize additional revenue or profits from our efforts we may incur additional expenses and therefore our financial position and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 

insurance and claims expenses could significantly reduce our profitability 

we are exposed to claims related to cargo loss and damage property damage personal injury workers’ compensation longterm disability and group health we have insurance coverage with thirdparty insurance carriers but selfinsure a portion of the risk associated with these claims if the number or severity of claims for which we are selfinsured increases or we are required to accrue or pay additional amounts because the claims prove to be more severe than our original assessment our operating results would be adversely affected in addition insurance companies require us to obtain letters of credit to collateralize our selfinsured retention if these requirements increase our borrowing capacity could be adversely affected 

  

our customers and suppliers’ business may be impacted by the current downturn in the worldwide economy and disruption of financial markets 

current economic conditions have adversely affected and may continue to adversely affect our customers’ business levels the amount of transportation services they need and their ability to pay for our services customers encountering adverse economic conditions may be unable to obtain additional financing or financing under acceptable terms because of the disruptions to the capital and credit markets these customers represent a greater potential for bad debt losses which may require us to increase our reserve for bad debt economic conditions resulting in bankruptcies of one or more of our large customers could have a significant impact on our financial position results of operations or liquidity in a particular year or quarter 

our supplier’s business levels have also been and may continue to be adversely affected by current economic conditions or financial constraints which could lead to disruptions in the supply and availability of equipment parts and services critical to our operations a significant interruption in our normal supply chain could disrupt our operations increase our costs and negatively impact our ability to serve our customers 

we have significant ongoing cash requirements that could limit our growth and affect our profitability if we are unable to obtain sufficient financing 

our business is highly capital intensive our purchases of property and equipment in 2008 and 2007 were 181499000 and 186828000 respectively we expect our net capital expenditures for 2009 to be approximately 190000000 while we intend to finance expansion and renovation projects with existing cash cash flow from operations and available borrowings under our existing senior unsecured credit agreement we may require additional financing to support our continued growth however due to the existing uncertainty in the capital and credit markets capital may not be available on terms acceptable to us if we are unable in the future to generate sufficient cash flow from operations or borrow the necessary capital to fund our planned capital expenditures we will be forced to limit our growth and operate our equipment for longer periods of time which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results 

in addition our business has significant operating cash requirements if our cash requirements are high or our cash flow from operations is low during particular periods we may need to seek additional financing which may be costly or difficult to obtain we have a 225000000 senior unsecured revolving credit facility that matures on august 10 2011 which we believe provides us with a sufficient source for borrowing as needed if any of the financial institutions that have extended credit commitments to us are or continue to be adversely affected by current economic conditions and disruption to the capital and credit markets they may become unable to fund borrowings under their credit commitments or otherwise fulfill their obligations to us which could have a material and adverse impact on our financial condition and our ability to borrow additional funds if needed for working capital capital expenditures acquisitions and other corporate purposes 

we may be adversely impacted by fluctuations in the price and availability of diesel fuel 

diesel fuel is a significant operating expense we do not hedge against the risk of diesel fuel price increases an increase in diesel fuel prices or diesel fuel taxes or any change in federal or state regulations that results in such an increase could have a material adverse effect on our operating results unless the increase is offset by increases in freight rates or fuel surcharges charged to our customers historically we have been able to offset significant increases in diesel fuel prices through fuel surcharges to our customers and we were able to minimize the negative impact on our profitability in 2008 that resulted from the rapid and significant increase to the cost of diesel fuel depending on the base rate and fuel surcharge levels agreed upon by individual shippers a rapid and significant decline in the cost of diesel fuel could also have a material adverse effect on our operating results we continuously monitor the components of our pricing including base freight rates and fuel surcharges and address individual account profitability issues with our customers when necessary while we have historically been able to adjust our pricing to offset changes to the cost of diesel fuel through changes to base rates andor fuel surcharges we cannot be certain that we will be able to do so in the future 

  

although we maintain fuel storage and pumping facilities at 36 of our service center locations we may experience shortages in the availability of diesel fuel at certain locations and may be forced to incur additional expense to ensure adequate supply on a timely basis to prevent a disruption to our service schedules an interruption in the supply of diesel fuel could have a material adverse effect on our operating results 

difficulty in attracting drivers could affect our profitability 

we periodically experience difficulties in attracting and retaining qualified drivers our operations may be affected by a shortage of qualified drivers in the future which could cause us to temporarily underutilize our fleet face difficulty in meeting shipper demands and increase our compensation levels for drivers if we encounter difficulty in attracting or retaining qualified drivers our ability to service our customers and increase our revenue could be adversely affected 

limited supply and increased prices for new equipment may adversely affect our earnings and cash flow 

investment in new equipment is a significant part of our annual capital expenditures we may face difficulty in purchasing new equipment due to decreased supply the price of our equipment may also be adversely affected in the future by regulations on newly manufactured tractors and diesel engines see the risk factor below entitled “we are subject to various environmental laws and regulations and costs of compliance with liabilities under or violations of existing or future environmental laws or regulations could adversely affect our business” 

we are subject to various environmental laws and regulations and costs of compliance with liabilities under or violations of existing or future environmental laws or regulations could adversely affect our business 

we are subject to various federal state and local environmental laws and regulations that govern among other things the emission and discharge of hazardous materials into the environment the presence of hazardous materials at our properties or in our vehicles fuel storage tanks the transportation of certain materials and the discharge or retention of storm water under certain environmental laws we could also be held responsible for any costs relating to contamination at our past or present facilities and at thirdparty waste disposal sites environmental laws have become and are expected to continue to be increasingly more stringent over time and there can be no assurance that our costs of complying with current or future environmental laws or liabilities arising under such laws will not have a material adverse effect on our business operations or financial condition 

the environmental protection agency has issued regulations that require progressive reductions in exhaust emissions from diesel engines through 2010 beginning in october 2002 new diesel engines were required to meet these new emission limits some of the regulations required reductions in the sulfur content of diesel fuel beginning in june 2006 and the introduction of emissions aftertreatment devices on newlymanufactured engines and vehicles beginning with model year 2007 these regulations have resulted in higher prices for tractors and diesel engines and increased fuel and maintenance costs and there can be no assurance that continued increases in pricing or costs will not have an adverse effect on our business and operations 

we operate in a highly regulated industry and increased costs of compliance with or liability for violation of existing or future regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business 

we are regulated by the dot and by various state agencies these regulatory authorities have broad powers generally governing matters such as authority to engage in motor carrier operations as well as motor carrier registration driver hours of service safety and fitness of transportation equipment and drivers transportation of hazardous materials certain mergers and acquisitions and periodic financial reporting in addition the trucking industry is subject to regulatory and legislative changes from a variety of other governmental authorities which address matters such as i increasingly stringent environmental occupational safety and health regulations ii limits on vehicle weight and size iii ergonomics and iv hours of service in 

  

addition we are subject to compliance with cargosecurity and transportation regulations issued by the transportation security administration within the us department of homeland security regulatory requirements and changes in regulatory requirements may affect our business or the economics of the industry by requiring changes in operating practices or by influencing the demand for and increasing the costs of providing transportation services 

our financial results may be adversely impacted by potential future changes in accounting practices 

future changes in accounting standards or practices and related legal and regulatory interpretations of those changes may adversely impact public companies in general the transportation industry or our operations specifically new accounting standards or requirements such as a conversion from us generally accepted accounting principles to international financial reporting standards could change the way we record revenues expenses assets and liabilities or could be costly to implement these types of regulations could have a negative impact on our financial position liquidity results of operations or access to capital 

our results of operations may be affected by seasonal factors and harsh weather conditions 

our operations are subject to seasonal trends common in the trucking industry our operating margins in the first quarter are normally lower due to reduced demand during the winter months harsh weather can also adversely affect our performance by reducing demand and reducing our ability to transport freight which could result in increased operating expenses 

our information technology systems are subject to certain risks that we cannot control 

our information systems including our accounting systems are dependent upon thirdparty software global communications providers telephone systems and other aspects of technology and internet infrastructure that are susceptible to failure although we have implemented redundant systems and network security measures our information technology remains susceptible to outages computer viruses breakins and similar disruptions that may inhibit our ability to provide services to our customers and the ability of our customers to access our systems this may result in the loss of customers or a reduction in demand for our services 

if we are unable to retain our key employees our financial condition results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected 

our success will continue to depend upon the experience and leadership of our key employees and executive officers in that regard the loss of the services of any of our key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operation and liquidity 

our principal shareholders control a large portion of our outstanding common stock 

earl e congdon john r congdon and members of their respective families beneficially own approximately onethird of the outstanding shares of our common stock as long as the congdon family controls a large portion of our voting stock they will be able to significantly influence the election of the entire board of directors and the outcome of all matters involving a shareholder vote the congdon family’s interests may differ from the interests of other shareholders

 item 2 properties 

we own our general office located in thomasville north carolina consisting of a twostory office building of approximately 160000 square feet on 301 acres of land at december 31 2008 we operated 206 service centers of which 108 were owned and 98 were leased we own all of our major breakbulk facilities which are listed below with the number of doors as of december 31 2008 

 

 these facilities are strategically dispersed over the states in which we operate at december 31 2008 the terms of our leased properties ranged from monthtomonth to a lease that expires in 2023 we believe that as current leases expire we will be able to renew them or find comparable facilities without incurring any material negative impact on service to our customers or our operating results 

we also own thirteen nonoperating properties all of which are held for lease eight of these properties are leased with lease terms that range from monthtomonth to a lease that expires in 2011 

we believe that all of our properties are in good repair and are capable of providing the level of service required by current business levels and customer demands 




 item 3 legal proceedings 

we are involved in various legal proceedings and claims that have arisen in the ordinary course of our business that have not been fully adjudicated many of these are covered in whole or in part by insurance our management does not believe that these actions when finally concluded and determined will have a material adverse effect upon our financial position liquidity or results of operations 

on july 30 2007 the company was named in a putative class action complaint against us and 10 other major ltl motor carriers and large transportation companies offering ltl services together “the defendants” this complaint alleges that the defendants conspired to restrain trade in violation of section 1 of the sherman act in connection with fuel surcharges to customers and seeks injunctive relief treble damages and attorneys’ fees subsequent to this original complaint similar complaints have been filed against the defendants and other ltl motor carriers each with the same allegation of conspiracy to fix fuel surcharge rates on december 20 2007 these cases were consolidated in the us district court for the northern district of georgia and all of the pending cases were transferred to that court on may 23 2008 plaintiffs filed a consolidated amended complaint naming the company and eight other defendants the defendants concluded briefing on a motion to dismiss the consolidated amended complaint and on january 28 2009 the motion to dismiss was granted without prejudice by the us district court the plaintiffs are permitted to file a motion to amend the complaint on or before march 16 2009 we believe that these allegations have no merit and intend to vigorously defend ourselves in the event that the plaintiffs amend their complaint prior to this date due to the nature and status of these claims we cannot determine the likelihood of an adverse outcome nor an amount or reasonable range of potential loss if any in these matters

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations tableend overview 

we are a leading nonunion lessthantruckload “ltl” multiregional motor carrier providing one to fiveday service among six regions in the united states and nextday and secondday service within these regions more than 90 of our revenue has historically been derived from transporting ltl shipments for our customers whose demand for our services is generally tied to the overall health of the us domestic economy 

in analyzing the components of our revenue we monitor changes and trends in the following key metrics 

 

   

  

  

  

 our primary revenue focus is to increase shipment and tonnage growth within our existing infrastructure generally referred to as increasing density thereby maximizing asset utilization and labor productivity we measure density over many different functional areas of our operations including revenue per service center linehaul load factor pd stops per hour pd shipments per hour and platform pounds handled per hour we believe continued improvement in density and a focus on individual account profitability are key components in our ability to sustain profitable growth 

our primary cost elements are direct wages and benefits associated with the movement of freight operating supplies and expenses and depreciation of our equipment fleet and service center facilities we gauge our overall success in managing these costs by monitoring our operating ratio a measure of profitability calculated by dividing total operating expenses by revenue which also allows industrywide comparisons with our competition 

we continually upgrade our technological capabilities to improve our customer service and lower our operating costs our technology provides our customers with visibility of their shipments throughout our network increases the productivity of our workforce and provides key metrics from which we can monitor our processes 

  

results of operations 

the following table sets forth for the years indicated expenses and other items as a percentage of revenue from operations 

 

  

 2008 compared to 2007 

key financial and operating metrics for 2008 and 2007 are presented below 

 

 we remained true to our longterm strategy in 2008 by providing consistent ontime service maintaining price discipline and driving additional operating efficiencies into our processes despite one of the most challenging operating environments we have ever experienced we were faced with record high fuel prices in the first half of 2008 which contributed to the overall increase in our operating expenses as fuel prices began to decline the domestic economy slipped into a recession causing significant and further declines in tonnage for the 

  

industry as a result pricing emerged as a primary driver of competition while we maintained a commitment to our pricing philosophy and achieved productivity improvements these factors were not sufficient to overcome our increased operating expenses and the negative impact of the recessionary economy as a result our earnings per diluted share decreased 47 to 184 for 2008 and our operating ratio increased 90 basis points to 916 we believe our strategy of providing high service levels maintaining price discipline and aggressively managing costs proved to be the best course of action in the ltl marketplace in 2008 and minimized much of the negative impact on our financial performance caused by increased competition and the downward spiral of the economy 

despite the challenges in 2008 our revenue increased 97 to 1537724000 which was driven by a 52 increase in total tonnage shipped and a 44 increase in revenue per hundredweight the 52 increase in tonnage shipped resulted from a 64 increase in weight per shipment that was partially offset by a 11 decrease in the number of shipments while an increase in weight per shipment is generally an indication of an improving economy we believe the increase in 2008 is more attributable to changes in customer shipping patterns as transportation costs increased we believe shippers are increasingly consolidating their shipments into larger units to ship less frequently at lower costs per hundredweight our mix of freight in 2008 reflects growth in truckload shipments spot quotes and container shipments all of which have an average higher weight per shipment 

we attribute our growth in tonnage primarily to increases in market share in our existing areas of operations while we increased the total number of service centers in our network to 206 at december 31 2008 from 192 at december 31 2007 over 95 of our revenue was produced from service centers open for more than one year as we continue to expand our geographic reach increase our fullstate coverage and increase our service capabilities we believe we will continue to gain additional market share from our existing customers and new customers who seek consistent highquality and valuedriven service while we experienced an overall increase in tonnage for 2008 freight demand weakened throughout the second half of the year and our tonnage declined 49 during the fourth quarter we believe that freight demand in the ltl industry will not improve until there is a general recovery in the domestic economy or a significant decrease in industry capacity as a result we could experience additional declines in our shipments and tonnage in 2009 

revenue per hundredweight increased 44 to 1388 from 1330 in 2007 revenue per hundredweight for 2008 reflects the impact of the general rate increase on our base rates and minimum charges for certain tariffs implemented on february 11 2008 as well as an increase in fuel surcharge revenue that resulted from the increase in the average price of diesel fuel during the year excluding fuel surcharges revenue per hundredweight decreased 14 in 2008 our revenue per hundredweight was also negatively impacted by the increase in weight per shipment as well as the 27 decline in the average length of haul 

the pricing environment in the ltl industry was extremely competitive throughout 2008 the competitiveness intensified in the second half of the year as the historical seasonal increase in freight volumes did not materialize as a result many carriers in our industry reduced their prices in an attempt to minimize declines in tonnage and shipment volumes although we increased the volume of freight moving through our service center network we did so while maintaining our basic pricing philosophy of evaluating each individual account for profitability in an effort to maintain rational pricing for our services we intend to maintain our disciplined approach to pricing by keeping our service at superior levels thus creating additional value to our customers we believe our rational and measured approach to the current pricing environment will be in our best longterm interest however a prolonged recession and competitive forces may result in some shortterm erosion in our pricing and shipment volumes which could have a material adverse impact on our revenue and net income 

fuel surcharge revenue increased to 172 of revenue from 124 in 2007 most of our tariffs and contracts provide for a fuel surcharge which is recorded as additional revenue as diesel fuel prices increase above stated levels these levels are generally indexed to the doe’s published fuel prices that reset each week the fuel surcharge is one of many components included in the overall negotiated price for our transportation services with 

  

our customers we continuously monitor the components of our pricing including base freight rates and fuel surcharges and address individual account profitability issues with our customers when necessary as part of our effort to minimize the negative impact on our profitability that would likely result from a rapid and significant change in any of our operating expenses 

salaries wages and benefits decreased to 523 of revenue in 2008 from 536 in 2007 while we were able to improve the productivity of our linehaul pd and platform operations the decrease as a percent of revenue primarily resulted from the overall increase in revenue the productivity improvements however helped minimize the impact of the annual general wage increase provided to our workforce in september 2007 and 2008 and the deleveraging effect of the fourth quarter decline in tonnage 

driver wages decreased to 210 of revenue in 2008 from 221 in 2007 we were able to effectively match our labor with the changes in shipment volume during the year while also improving our productivity in our linehaul operations we increased our laden load average 18 pd shipments per hour and pd stops per hour increased 23 and 07 respectively platform wages decreased to 67 of revenue from 73 in 2007 platform pounds handled per hour increased 104 primarily as a result of the increase in weight per shipment 

employee benefit costs increased to 301 of salaries and wages in 2008 from 285 in 2007 the increase is attributable to rising group health and dental costs which increased to 103 of total salary and wages in 2008 from 91 and increased costs associated with our paid time off for employees we experienced an increase in the severity of our health claims in 2008 which resulted in a 163 increase in claim payments as compared to 2007 

operating supplies and expenses increased to 199 of revenue in 2008 from 170 in 2007 this increase is primarily due to the significant rise in diesel fuel costs excluding fuel taxes which is the largest component of operating supplies and expenses these costs increased 372 during the year as a result of a significant increase in the price of diesel fuel and to a lesser extent a 02 increase in gallons consumed we were able to minimize our consumption of fuel in 2008 by implementing several initiatives designed to improve our miles per gallon we do not use diesel fuel hedging instruments and are therefore subject to market price fluctuations 

depreciation and amortization remained consistent at 57 of revenue for both 2008 and 2007 we continued to make significant investments in our service center network and revenue equipment in 2008 we purchased eleven service centers and also completed several expansion projects to existing service centers to increase the overall capacity of our service center network we reduced our capital expenditures for revenue equipment in 2008 as compared to our purchases in recent years to appropriately match our fleet size with freight demands we also incurred an increase in building and office equipment rents to 09 of revenue from 08 for 2007 due to an increase in both the number and size of leased facilities 

other expense net increased to 02 of revenue from 01 of revenue in 2007 the increase reflects the decline in the cash value of our variable life insurance contracts related to the company’s nonqualified deferred compensation plans the cash value of these contracts was unfavorably impacted by the decline in equity markets during 2008 

our effective tax rate for 2008 was 390 compared to 380 in 2007 our effective tax rate was lower in 2007 as a result of the favorable impact of alternative fuel tax credits for the use of propane in our operations that we became eligible for in 2007 and to a lesser extent the resolution of various state tax matters in the first quarter of 2007 that decreased our liability for unrecognized tax benefits we expect the alternative fuel tax credits will continue to favorably impact our effective tax rate until these credits are no longer available in 2010 our effective tax rate exceeded the federal statutory rate of 35 primarily due to the impact of state taxes and certain nondeductible items 

  

2007 compared to 2006 

key financial and operating metrics for 2007 and 2006 are presented below 

 

 our 2007 financial results were reflective of a difficult operating environment that became increasingly competitive in terms of pricing throughout the year despite the general weakness in the domestic economy and resulting competitive pricing environment we were able to increase revenue by 95 to 1401542000 in 2007 and increase our total tonnage shipped by 85 these accomplishments were the result of the consistent execution of our business strategies in the ltl marketplace which resulted in increased market share we also maintained our revenue focus on increasing density which resulted in producing over 95 of our revenue from service centers open for more than one year and an overall increase in average revenue per service center of 25 despite our growth in revenue and tonnage during 2007 we were unable to increase our pricing sufficiently to overcome increased operating costs particularly with respect to the increased cost of diesel fuel as a result net income decreased 10 to 71832000 in 2007 and our operating ratio increased to 907 from 898 in 2006 nevertheless our slightly higher operating ratio in 2007 was the second best we have achieved since becoming a public company in 1991 and reflected our continued focus on managing costs during a period of slower growth and continued gains in efficiency throughout our operations 

our revenue growth in 2007 was the result of a 52 growth in shipments and a 41 increase in revenue per shipment the increase in revenue per shipment consists of increases in both weight per shipment and revenue per hundredweight of 30 and 11 respectively from 2006 our tonnage increased 85 over 2006 from the combination of increases in shipments and weight per shipment we believe our growth is attributable to our ability to offer a onesource solution for shippers’ regional and interregional needs by providing these services through one company in contrast to many of our principal competitors additionally the expansion of our geographic footprint as well as increased fullstate coverage has positioned us to become a better shipping alternative for more and more shippers the increase in weight per shipment in 2007 despite the economic environment was indicative of our success in gaining market share from larger national shippers 

while most of our revenue growth is derived from service centers open for more than one year the expansion of our service center network and improvement in our service capabilities should provide a platform for future growth we increased the total number of service centers in our network to 192 at december 31 2007 from 182 at december 31 2006 revenue growth from geographic expansion typically results in additional freight moving through our existing service center network which helps to offset lower profit margins that typically accompany new service center openings 

revenue per hundredweight increased 11 to 1330 from 1316 in 2006 and includes the impact of the general rate increase on our base rates and minimum charges for certain tariffs we implemented on march 26 2007 our revenue per hundredweight in 2007 was negatively impacted by a competitive pricing environment that progressively worsened in the second half of the year and an increase in weight per shipment as a result of a 

  

general slowdown in the domestic economy and a reduction in freight shipped during 2007 many carriers in our industry reduced their prices to increase or maintain tonnage and shipment volumes while we increased the volume of freight moving through our service center network we followed our basic pricing philosophy of evaluating each individual account for profitability in an effort to maintain rational pricing for our services we implemented a general rate increase effective february 11 2008 in an effort to maintain our disciplined pricing approach however a prolonged slowdown in the domestic economy or recession may lead to additional pressure on our pricing metrics and negatively impact our net income and margins 

fuel surcharge revenue increased to 124 of revenue from 119 in 2006 our tariffs and contracts generally provide for a fuel surcharge as diesel fuel prices increase above stated levels which are generally indexed to the doe’s published fuel prices that reset each week this surcharge is recorded as additional revenue and was implemented to offset significant fluctuations in the price of diesel fuel which is one of the larger components of our operating supplies and expenses because of the sustained increase in diesel fuel costs and other petroleumbased products our freight pricing strategy as well as that in the ltl industry has evolved such that the fuel surcharge is one of many components in the overall price for our transportation services we continuously monitor the components of our pricing including fuel surcharges to minimize any negative impact to our profitability that would likely result from a rapid and significant change in diesel fuel prices 

salaries wages and benefits increased to 536 of revenue in 2007 from 534 in 2006 driver wages increased to 221 of revenue from 217 in 2006 and employee benefit costs increased to 119 of revenue from 115 in 2006 primarily due to higher group health costs and increased costs for our employee paid time off plans these increases were partially offset by decreased wages for salaried and clerical employees primarily due to a reduction in bonuses bonus payments are generally based on multiple factors including growth in revenue ontime service andor income before taxes our revenue increased 95 in 2007 as compared to 205 in 2006 and net income decreased slightly 

while our driver wages increased as a percent of revenue we were able to utilize our own equipment and labor to decrease our reliance on purchased transportation services from other motor carriers and railroads to 31 of revenue from 34 in 2006 these services are primarily utilized when there are capacity restraints or imbalances in freight flow within our service center network or when it is economically beneficial in addition to the increased use of our workforce for linehaul services we provided annual pay increases to our driver workforce in september 2006 and 2007 which we seek to recover through increases in the pricing for our services and productivity improvements in our linehaul and pd operations we realized productivity improvements in 2007 as our linehaul load factor improved 20 pd stops per hour improved 28 and pd shipments per hour improved 24 our pd operations continue to benefit from the additional density caused by growth in tonnage the efficiencies in our route planning through the use of our pd route optimization software and the use of our driver handheld computers despite these productivity gains our price increases were not sufficient in overcoming our wage increases and the decrease in purchased transportation 

operating supplies and expenses increased to 170 of revenue in 2007 from 160 in 2006 this increase is primarily due to an increase in diesel fuel costs excluding fuel taxes which increased to 115 of revenue from 107 in 2006 the increase in these costs is a result of a 74 increase in the average price per gallon of diesel fuel and an 88 increase in consumption the consumption increase also resulted in an increase in our fuel taxes which primarily accounts for the change in our “operating taxes and licenses” we currently do not use diesel fuel hedging instruments and are thus subject to market price fluctuations 

we made significant investments in revenue equipment and real estate in 2007 to increase the capacity of our fleet and support our planned growth in shipments as a result of these investments as well as lower shipment growth than originally forecasted for 2007 depreciation and amortization increased to 57 of revenue in 2007 from 53 in 2006 

interest expense net of interest income increased to 12960000 for 2007 from 10206000 for 2006 this increase is primarily due to an increased average balance outstanding on our longterm debt resulting from the 

  

two separate issuances of privatelyplaced senior notes under the note purchase agreement entered into on april 25 2006 in addition interest income decreased 731000 in 2007 due to a decline in the average balance of cash equivalents and shortterm investments the effective average taxequivalent yield excluding statetax benefits on our shortterm investments was 632 and 568 for 2007 and 2006 respectively 

our effective tax rate for 2007 was 380 compared to 392 in 2006 the decrease in our effective tax rate is due primarily to the impact of alternative fuel tax credits for the use of propane in our operations that we became eligible for in 2007 and to a lesser extent the resolution of various state tax matters in the first quarter of 2007 that decreased our liability for unrecognized tax benefits we expect the alternative fuel tax credits will continue to favorably impact our effective tax rate until these credits are no longer available in 2010 our effective tax rate exceeded the federal statutory rate of 35 primarily due to the impact of state taxes and certain nondeductible items 

liquidity and capital resources 

a summary of our cash flows is presented below 

 

 we have three primary sources of available liquidity to fund our estimated capital expenditures cash flows from operations cash and cash equivalents and available borrowings under our senior unsecured revolving credit agreement described below at december 31 2008 cash and shortterm investments decreased to 28965000 from 30703000 at december 31 2007 

despite the current economic environment we believe that our ability to generate cash from operations together with our 225000000 senior unsecured revolving credit facility and other available methods of financing will be adequate to meet our operating investing and financing needs we believe we also have sufficient access to the capital markets to provide another source of liquidity if needed however there can be no assurance that continued or increased volatility in the global capital and credit markets will not impair our ability to access these markets on terms commercially acceptable to us or at all 

capital expenditures 

the table below sets forth our net capital expenditures for property and equipment including those obtained through acquisition of business assets and capital leases for the years ended december 31 2008 2007 and 2006 

 

   

our capital expenditure requirements are based primarily upon expansion in the size and number of service center facilities our planned tractor and trailer replacement cycle and revenue growth in order to support these requirements we purchased property and equipment of 181499000 and paid 7267000 to acquire certain business assets through acquisitions these expenditures were completely funded by cash flows from operations and proceeds from the sale of property and equipment our capital expenditures for tractors and trailers in 2008 were lower than 2007 and 2006 as we were able to effectively utilize our existing fleet in 2008 to meet our freight demands as a result our purchases were limited to replacing a portion of the equipment being retired through the normal replacement cycle as compared to the capital expenditures in 2007 and 2006 when we both replaced equipment and increased capacity to support our growth and geographic expansion 

we currently project capital expenditures net of anticipated proceeds from dispositions to be approximately 190000000 for the year ending december 31 2009 of our capital expenditures approximately 90000000 is allocated for the purchase of tractors and trailers to replace equipment at the end of its useful life approximately 85000000 is allocated for the purchase of service center facilities construction of new service center facilities or expansion of existing service center facilities and approximately 13000000 is allocated for investments in technology we expect to fund a substantial majority of these capital expenditures primarily through cash flows from operations and the liquidation of our cash and shortterm investments 

financing agreements 

we have a 225000000 senior unsecured revolving credit facility pursuant to the terms of an amended and restated credit agreement that matures on august 10 2011 the “credit agreement” wachovia bank national association “wachovia” serves as administrative agent for the lenders which also include bank of america na branch banking and trust company suntrust bank us bank national association and high point bank and trust company of the 225000000 line of credit commitments 150000000 may be used for letters of credit and 15000000 may be used for borrowings under wachovia’s sweep program the sweep program is a daily cash management tool that automatically initiates borrowings to cover overnight cash requirements up to an aggregate of 15000000 or initiates overnight investments for excess cash balances in addition we have the right to request an increase in the line of credit commitments up to a total of 300000000 in minimum increments of 25000000 at our option revolving loans under the facility bear interest at either a the higher of wachovia’s prime rate or the federal funds rate plus 05 per annum b libor one two three or six months plus an applicable margin “adjusted libor rate” or c onemonth libor plus an applicable margin “libor index rate” the applicable margin is determined by a pricing grid in the credit agreement and ranges from 05 to 1125 the applicable margin for the credit agreement in 2008 was 0625 revolving loans under the sweep program bear interest at the libor index rate 

in december 2008 wachovia corporation merged with wells fargo  company pursuant to the merger wells fargo  company acquired all of wachovia corporation’s business and obligations of the total 225000000 line of credit commitments from all lenders wachovia has committed 52500000 we do not expect this merger to have an impact on wachovia’s commitment under the credit agreement or our ability to access available funds 

the credit agreement contains customary covenants including financial covenants that require us to observe a maximum ratio of debt to total capital and a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio any future whollyowned subsidiaries of the company would be required to guarantee payment of all of our obligations under the facility at december 31 2008 there was no outstanding balance on the line of credit facility and there was 50260000 of outstanding letters of credit relating primarily to our selfinsured obligations 

commitment fees ranging from 01 to 0225 are charged quarterly in arrears on the aggregate unutilized portion of the credit agreement letter of credit fees equal to the applicable margin for adjusted libor rate loans are charged quarterly in arrears on the daily average aggregate stated amount of all letters of credit outstanding during the quarter the commitment fees and letter of credit fees were 0125 and 0625 respectively for the credit 

  

agreement in 2008 in addition a facing fee at an annual rate of 0125 is charged quarterly in arrears on the daily average aggregate stated amount of all letters of credit outstanding during such quarter 

we have two unsecured senior note agreements outstanding totaling 250000000 at december 31 2008 these notes call for periodic principal payments with maturities in 2015 and 2016 of which 10714000 is due in the next twelve months interest rates on these notes are fixed at 468 and 585 the effective average interest rate on our outstanding senior note agreements was 550 and 556 at december 31 2008 and 2007 respectively 

with the exception of borrowings pursuant to the credit agreement if any interest rates are fixed on all of our debt instruments therefore shortterm exposure to fluctuations in interest rates is limited to our line of credit facility we do not currently use interest rate derivative instruments to manage exposure to interest rate changes 

our credit agreement limits the amount of dividends that could be paid to shareholders to the greater of i 10000000 ii the amount of dividends paid in the immediately preceding fiscal year or iii an amount equal to 25 of net income from the immediately preceding fiscal year we did not declare or pay a dividend on our common stock in 2008 or 2007 and we have no plans to declare or pay a dividend in 2009 

a significant decrease in demand for our services could limit our ability to generate cash flow and affect profitability most of our debt agreements have covenants that require stated levels of financial performance which if not achieved could cause acceleration of the payment schedules as of december 31 2008 we were in compliance with these covenants despite current macroeconomic and credit conditions we do not anticipate a significant decline in business levels or financial performance that would cause us to violate any such covenants in the future and we believe the combination of our existing credit agreement along with our additional borrowing capacity will be sufficient to meet foreseeable seasonal and longterm capital needs 

contractual obligations 

the following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations as of december 31 2008 

 

  

 critical accounting policies 

in preparing our financial statements we apply the following critical accounting policies that we believe affect our judgments and estimates of amounts recorded in certain assets liabilities revenue and expenses these critical accounting policies are further described in note 1 of the notes to the financial statements included in item 8 of this report 

  

revenue recognition 

we recognize revenue based upon when our transportation services have been completed in accordance with the bill of lading contract our general tariff provisions or contractual agreements with our customers generally this occurs when we complete the delivery of a shipment for transportation services not completed at the end of a reporting period we use a percentage of completion method to allocate the appropriate revenue to each separate reporting period under this method we develop a factor for each uncompleted shipment by dividing the actual number of days in transit at the end of a reporting period by that shipment’s standard delivery time schedule this factor is applied to the total revenue for that shipment and revenue is allocated between reporting periods accordingly 

allowances for uncollectible accounts and revenue adjustments 

we maintain an allowance for uncollectible accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments we estimate this allowance by analyzing the aging of our customer receivables our historical loss experience and other trends and factors affecting the credit risk of our customers writeoffs occur when we determine an account to be uncollectible and could differ from our allowance estimate as a result of factors such as changes in the overall economic environment or risks surrounding our customers additional allowances may be required if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments we periodically review the underlying assumptions in our estimate of the allowance for uncollectible accounts to ensure that the allowance reflects the most recent trends and factors 

we also maintain an allowance for revenue adjustments resulting from billing corrections customer allowances moneyback service guarantees and other miscellaneous revenue adjustments these revenue adjustments are recorded in our revenue from operations we use historical experience trends and current information to update and evaluate these estimates 

management believes the methodologies for estimating these allowances to be reliable based on the accuracy of our estimates in prior periods as such we do not anticipate any nearterm changes in our methodologies for these estimates 

claims and insurance accruals 

claims and insurance accruals reflect the estimated cost of claims for cargo loss and damage bodily injury and property damage workers’ compensation longterm disability and group health not covered by insurance the related costs are charged to insurance and claims expense except for workers’ compensation longterm disability and group health which are charged to employee benefits expense 

insurers providing excess coverage above retention levels adjust their premiums to cover insured losses and for other market factors as a result we periodically evaluate our selfinsured retention levels to determine the most costefficient balance between selfinsurance and excess coverage 

in establishing accruals for claims and insurance expenses we evaluate and monitor each claim individually and we use factors such as historical claims development experience known trends and thirdparty estimates to determine the appropriate reserves for potential liability we believe the assumptions and methods used to estimate these liabilities are reasonable however changes in the severity of previouslyreported claims significant changes in the medical costs and regulatory changes affecting the administration of our plans could significantly impact the determination of appropriate reserves in future periods 

  

property and equipment 

property and equipment are recorded at cost and depreciated on a straightline basis over their estimated economic lives management uses historical experience certain assumptions and estimates in determining the economic life of each asset periodically we review property and equipment for impairment due to changes in operational and market conditions and we adjust the carrying value and economic life of any impaired asset as appropriate currently estimated economic lives for structures are 7 to 30 years revenue equipment is 4 to 12 years other equipment is 2 to 20 years and leasehold improvements are the lesser of the economic life of the leasehold improvement or the remaining life of the lease the use of different assumptions estimates or significant changes in the resale market for our equipment could result in material changes in the carrying value and related depreciation of our assets 

inflation 

most of our expenses are affected by inflation which generally results in increased operating costs in response to fluctuations in the cost of petroleum products particularly diesel fuel we generally include a fuel surcharge in our tariffs and contractual agreements the fuel surcharge is designed to offset the cost of diesel fuel above a base price and increases as diesel fuel prices escalate over the base which is generally indexed to the doe’s published fuel prices that reset each week volatility in the price of diesel fuel independent of inflation has impacted our business as described in this report however we do not believe inflation has had a material effect on our results of operations for each of the past three years 

related person transactions 

family relationships 

each of earl e congdon john r congdon david s congdon john r congdon jr and john b yowell are related to one another and serve in various executive management positions andor on our board of directors in addition earl e congdon john r congdon and john b yowell each beneficially owned 5 or more of our common stock at december 31 2008 in 2008 we entered into amended and restated employment agreements with earl e congdon john r congdon david s congdon and john b yowell which are filed as exhibits to our annual report on form 10k we regularly disclose the amount of compensation that we pay to these individuals in the proxy statement for our annual meeting of shareholders 

transactions with old dominion truck leasing inc 

old dominion truck leasing inc “leasing” is a north carolina corporation whose voting stock is owned by the earl e congdon intangibles trust david s congdon trustee the john r congdon revocable trust and members of earl e congdon’s and john r congdon’s families leasing is primarily engaged in the business of purchasing and leasing tractors trailers and other vehicles john r congdon is chairman of the board of leasing and earl e congdon is vice chairman of the board of leasing since 1986 we have combined our requirements with leasing for the purchase of tractors trailers equipment parts tires and fuel we believe that the termination of this arrangement would not have a material adverse impact on our financial results 

for the years ended december 31 2008 2007 and 2006 we charged leasing 11000 4000 and 3000 respectively for vehicle repair maintenance and other services we provide to leasing at cost plus a negotiated markup 

we purchased 260000 257000 and 186000 of maintenance and other services from leasing in 2008 2007 and 2006 respectively we believe that the prices we pay for such services are lower than would be charged by unaffiliated third parties for the same quality of work and we intend to continue to purchase maintenance and other services from leasing provided that leasing’s prices continue to be favorable to us 

  

we also paid leasing 257000 588000 and 519000 for leased equipment in 2008 2007 and 2006 respectively the leased equipment was primarily utilized by our customers in 2007 and 2006 who reimbursed us for the lease amount through a periodic billing process that included charges for additional services we provided to these customers we believe these leasing agreements are at arm’s length and we received no commission or other financial benefit from leasing or any other party in connection with these lease transactions our lease payments in 2008 were for longterm leases for tractors that we utilize in our linehaul operations and expire in january 2011

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact our financial position results of operations and cash flows due to adverse changes in financial market prices and rates 

we are exposed to interest rate risk directly related to loans if any under our credit agreement which have variable interest rates a 100 basis point increase in the average interest rate on this agreement would have no material effect on our operating results we have established policies and procedures to manage exposure to market risks and use major institutions that are creditworthy to minimize credit risk 

we are exposed to interest rate and market risk related to our shortterm investments which include variablerate demand obligations as of december 31 2008 however we invest in high quality investment grade securities with interest reset periods generally between 1 to 7 days a 100 basis point decrease in the average interest rate on our shortterm investments would have no material effect on our operating results the majority of our excess cash is now invested in money market funds that are included in “cash and cash equivalents” on our balance sheets we have not experienced any losses in the investment of our cash in money market funds or shortterm investments at december 31 2008 the company did not own any auctionrate securities 

we are exposed to market risk for equity investments relating to companyowned life insurance contracts on certain employees at december 31 2008 the cash value for variable life insurance contracts was 7379000 of the total 12839000 of cash values for all life insurance contracts included on our balance sheet in “other assets” variable life insurance contracts expose the company to fluctuations in equity markets however we utilize a thirdparty to manage these assets and minimize that exposure a 10 change in market value in those investments would have a 738000 impact on our operating income 

we are also exposed to commodity price risk related to diesel fuel prices and manage our exposure to that risk primarily through the application of fuel surcharges

 item 1 business 

unless the context requires otherwise references in this report to “old dominion” the “company” “we” “us” and “our” refer to old dominion freight line inc 

general 

we are a leading national lessthantruckload “ltl” motor carrier providing multiregional service among six regions in the united states and nextday and secondday service within each of these regions we operate as one business segment and offer an expanding array of innovative products and services through our four branded product groups oddomestic odexpedited odglobal and odtechnology at february 28 2008 we provided fullstate coverage to 39 of the 48 states that we served directly within the southeast gulf coast northeast midwest central and west regions of the country we plan to continue to expand our service center network as opportunities arise to achieve our strategic goal of providing fullstate coverage throughout the continental united states these additions should provide a platform for future growth and ensure that our service center network has sufficient capacity in addition to our domestic ltl services we offer container delivery services and assembly and distribution services to and from all of north america central america south america and the far east we also offer a broad range of expedited and logistical services for both our domestic and global markets 

we have grown substantially over the last several years through strategic acquisitions and internal growth prior to 1995 we provided interregional service to major metropolitan areas from and regional service within the southeast region of the united states since 1995 we have expanded our infrastructure to provide nextday and secondday service within four additional regions as well as expanded interregional service among those regions from 1995 through february 28 2008 we increased our number of service centers from 53 to 204 and our states directly served from 21 to 48 we believe that our present infrastructure will enable us to increase freight density which is the volume of freight moving through our network and thereby improve our profitability 

we are committed to providing our customers with high quality service we provide consistent customer service from a single organization offering our customers information and pricing from one point of contact our multiregional competitors that offer interregional service typically do so through independent companies or with separate points of contact within different operating segments which can result in inconsistent service and pricing as well as poor shipment visibility our integrated structure allows us to offer our customers consistent and continuous service across all areas of operations and service products 

old dominion was founded in 1934 and incorporated in virginia in 1950 please refer to the balance sheets and statements of operations included in item 8 of this report for information regarding our total assets revenue from operations and net income 

  

our industry 

trucks provide transportation services to virtually every industry operating in the united states and generally offer higher levels of reliability and faster transit times than other surface transportation options the trucking industry is comprised principally of two types of motor carriers truckload and ltl truckload carriers generally provide an entire trailer to one customer from origin to destination ltl carriers pick up multiple shipments from multiple customers on a single truck and then route the goods through service centers where freight may be transferred to other trucks with similar destinations for delivery 

in contrast to truckload carriers ltl motor carriers require expansive networks of local pickup and delivery service centers as well as larger breakbulk or hub facilities the significant capital that ltl motor carriers must commit to create and maintain a network of service centers and a fleet of tractors and trailers makes it difficult for startup or small operations to effectively compete with established companies in addition successful ltl motor carriers generally employ and continuously update a high level of technology to provide information to customers and to reduce operating costs 

service center operations 

at december 31 2007 we conducted operations through 192 service center locations of which we own 97 and lease 95 we operate major breakbulk facilities in atlanta georgia rialto california indianapolis indiana greensboro north carolina harrisburg pennsylvania memphis and morristown tennessee and dallas texas while using some smaller service centers for limited breakbulk activity in order to serve nextday markets our service centers are strategically located in six regions of the country to provide the highest quality service and minimize freight rehandling costs 

each of our service centers is responsible for the pickup and delivery of freight for its service area each service center loads outbound freight by destination the day it is picked up all inbound freight received by the service center in the evening or during the night is scheduled for local delivery the next business day unless a customer requests a different delivery schedule our management reviews the productivity and service performance of each service center on a daily basis to ensure quality service and efficient operations 

while we have established primary responsibility for customer service at the local service center level our customers may access information and initiate transactions through several different gateways such as our website electronic data interchange automated voice response systems automated fax systems or through our customer service department located at the corporate office our systems offer direct access to information such as freight tracking shipping documents rate quotes rate databases and account activity these centralized systems and customer service department provide our customers with a single point of contact to access information across all areas of our operations and service products 

linehaul transportation 

linehaul dispatchers are centralized at our corporate headquarters and control the movement of freight among service centers through integrated freight movement systems we also utilize loadplanning software to optimize efficiencies in our linehaul operations our senior management continuously monitors freight movements transit times load factors and other productivity measurements to ensure that we maintain our highest levels of service and efficiency 

we utilize scheduled routes and additional linehaul dispatches as necessary to meet our published service standards in addition we lower our cost structure by maintaining flexible work force rules and by primarily using twin 28foot trailers in our linehaul operations the use of twin 28foot trailers permits us to transport freight directly from its point of origin to destination with minimal unloading and reloading which also reduces cargo loss and damage expenses we also utilize longcombination vehicles such as triple 28foot trailers and combinations of 48foot and 28foot trailers in states where permitted twin trailers and longcombination vehicles permit more freight to be hauled behind a tractor than could otherwise be hauled by one large trailer 

  

tractors trailers and maintenance 

at december 31 2007 we operated 5016 tractors we generally use new tractors in linehaul operations for approximately three to five years and then transfer those tractors to pickup and delivery operations for the remainder of the assets’ useful lives in a number of our service centers tractors perform pickup and delivery functions during the day and linehaul functions at night to maximize tractor utilization 

at december 31 2007 we operated a fleet of 19513 trailers we primarily purchase new trailers for our operations however we occasionally purchase preowned equipment meeting our specifications from other trucking companies 

we have also acquired tractors and trailers through our acquisition of business assets from other carriers the purchase of preowned equipment can provide an excellent value but can increase our fleet’s average age the table below reflects as of december 31 2007 the average age of our tractors and trailers 

 

 we develop certain specifications for tractors and trailers the production and purchase of which are negotiated with several manufacturers these purchases are planned well in advance of anticipated delivery dates in order to accommodate manufacturers’ production schedules we believe that there is sufficient capacity among suppliers to ensure an uninterrupted supply of equipment to support our operations and planned growth 

the table below sets forth our capital expenditures for tractors and trailers for the years ended december 31 2007 2006 and 2005 our capital expenditures for tractors and trailers in 2007 provided the capacity to support our continued growth and geographic expansion and to a lesser extent to replace equipment as part of our normal replacement cycle 

 

 at december 31 2007 we had major maintenance operations at our service centers in los angeles and rialto california denver colorado atlanta georgia chicago illinois indianapolis indiana kansas city and parsons kansas jersey city new jersey greensboro north carolina columbus ohio harrisburg pennsylvania morristown and memphis tennessee dallas texas and salt lake city utah in addition eleven other service center locations are equipped to perform routine and preventive maintenance and repairs on our equipment 

we have established maintenance policies and procedures linehaul tractors are routed to appropriate maintenance facilities at designated mileage or time intervals depending upon how the equipment was utilized pickup and delivery tractors and trailers are scheduled for maintenance every 90 days 

  

marketing and customers 

at december 31 2007 we had a sales staff of 459 employees we compensate our sales force in part based upon revenue generated company and service center profitability and ontime service performance which we believe helps to motivate our employees to achieve our service growth and profitability objectives 

we utilize a computerized freight costing model to determine the price level at which a particular shipment of freight will be profitable we can modify elements of this freight costing model to simulate the actual conditions under which the freight will be moved we also compete for business by participating in bid solicitations customers generally solicit bids for relatively large numbers of shipments for a period of one to two years and typically choose to enter into contractual arrangements with a limited number of motor carriers based upon price and service 

revenue is generated from many customers and locations primarily across the united states and north america in 2007 our largest customer accounted for approximately 19 of revenue and our largest 20 10 and 5 customers accounted for approximately 180 119 and 72 of our revenue respectively for each of the previous three years over 90 of our revenue is derived from transporting ltl shipments for our customers and less than 5 of our revenue was generated from international services we believe the diversity of our revenue base helps protect our business from adverse developments in a single geographic region and the reduction or loss of business from a single customer for information concerning total revenue for each of the last three fiscal years see “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” included in item 7 of this report 

competition 

the transportation industry is highly competitive on the basis of both price and service at december 31 2007 we were the sixth largest ltl carrier in the united states as measured by revenue we compete with regional interregional and national ltl carriers and to a lesser extent with truckload carriers small package carriers airfreight carriers and railroads competition is based primarily on service price and business relationships we believe that we are able to compete effectively in our markets by providing high quality and timely service at competitive prices 

we believe our transit times are generally faster than those of our principal national competitors we believe this performance is due in part to our more efficient service center network use of team drivers and investment in technology in addition we provide greater geographic coverage than most of our regional competitors we believe our diversified mix and scope of regional and interregional services enable us to provide our customers with a single source to meet their ltl shipping needs and provides us with a distinct advantage over our regional multiregional and national competition 

we also believe our nonunion workforce gives us a significant advantage over our unionized ltl competition advantages of our workforce include flexible hours and the ability of our employees to perform multiple tasks which we believe result in greater productivity customer service efficiency and cost savings 

we compete with several larger transportation service providers each of which may have more equipment a broader coverage network and a wider range of services than we do our larger competitors may also have greater financial resources and in general the ability to reduce prices to gain business especially during times of reduced growth rates in the economy this could potentially limit our ability to maintain or increase prices or maintain significant growth 

seasonality 

our tonnage levels and revenue mix are subject to seasonal trends common in the motor carrier industry financial results in the first quarter are normally lower due to reduced shipments during the winter months harsh winter weather can also adversely impact our performance by reducing demand and increasing operating expenses freight volumes typically build to a peak in the third quarter and early fourth quarter which generally results in improved operating margins 

  

technology 

we continually upgrade our technological capabilities and we provide access to our systems through multiple gateways that offer our customers maximum flexibility and immediate access to information we employ vehicle safety systems freight handling systems and logistics technology to reduce costs and transit times our principal technologies include 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

   

insurance 

we carry a significant amount of insurance with thirdparty insurance carriers and we selfinsure a portion of this risk we are currently selfinsured for bodily injury and property damage claims up to 2750000 per occurrence cargo loss and damage claims are selfinsured up to 100000 per occurrence we are exposed to workers’ compensation claims up to 1000000 per occurrence through either selfinsurance or insurance deductibles for the states in which we operate group health claims are selfinsured up to 325000 per occurrence and longterm disability claims are selfinsured to a maximum per individual of 3000 per month 

we believe that our policy of selfinsuring a portion of our risk together with our safety and loss prevention programs is an effective means of managing insurance costs we also believe that our current insurance coverage is adequate to cover our liability risks 

diesel fuel availability and cost 

our industry depends heavily upon the availability of diesel fuel from time to time we may experience shortages at certain locations and have been forced to incur additional expense to ensure adequate supply on a timely basis to prevent a disruption to our service schedules as a result of higher diesel fuel costs we implemented a fuel surcharge program in august 1999 that has remained in effect since that time and has become one of many components in the overall price for our transportation services our fuel surcharges are generally indexed to the us department of energy’s published fuel prices that reset each week our management believes that our operations and financial condition are susceptible to the same diesel fuel price increases or shortages as those of our competitors diesel fuel costs including fuel taxes totaled 141 and 132 of revenue in 2007 and 2006 respectively 

employees 

as of december 31 2007 we employed 11573 individuals on a fulltime basis in the following categories 

 

 as of december 31 2007 we employed 2815 linehaul drivers and 3105 pickup and delivery drivers all of our drivers are selected based upon driving records and experience each of our drivers is required to pass a drug test and have a current united states department of transportation “dot” physical and a valid commercial driver’s license prior to employment once employed drivers are required to obtain and maintain hazardous materials endorsements to their commercial driver’s licenses drivers are also required to periodically take drug and alcohol tests by random selection 

to help fulfill driver needs we offer qualified employees the opportunity to become drivers through the “old dominion driver training program” since its inception in 1988 2349 individuals have graduated from this program from which we have experienced an annual turnover rate of approximately 6 we believe our driver training and qualification programs have been important factors in improving our safety record drivers with safe driving records are rewarded with bonuses of up to 1000 annually driver safety bonuses paid during 2007 were 1154000 

our focus on communication and the continued education development and motivation of our employees helps to ensure that our relationship with our employees remains excellent there are no employees represented under a collective bargaining agreement which we believe is an important factor in our continued success 

  

governmental regulation 

we are regulated by the surface transportation board an agency within the dot and by various state agencies these regulatory authorities have broad powers generally governing matters such as authority to engage in motor carrier operations hours of service certain mergers consolidations and acquisitions and periodic financial reporting the trucking industry is subject to regulatory and legislative changes such as increasingly stringent environmental and occupational safety and health regulations limits on vehicle weight and size ergonomics and hours of service these changes may affect the economics of our industry by requiring changes in operating practices increasing our cost and influencing the demand for our services 

we believe that the cost of compliance with applicable laws and regulations has not and will not materially affect our results of operations or financial condition 

environmental regulation 

we are subject to various federal state and local environmental laws and regulations that focus on among other things the emission and discharge of hazardous materials into the environment or their presence on or in our properties and vehicles fuel storage tanks transportation of certain materials and the discharge or retention of storm water under specific environmental laws we could also be held responsible for any costs relating to contamination at our past or present facilities and at thirdparty waste disposal sites we do not believe that the cost of future compliance with environmental laws or regulations will have a material adverse effect on our operations financial condition competitive position or capital expenditures for the remainder of fiscal year 2008 or fiscal year 2009 

 

tablestart 


 item 1a risk factors tableend in addition to the factors discussed elsewhere in this report the following are some of the important factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those projected in any forwardlooking statements 

we operate in a highly competitive industry and our business will suffer if we are unable to adequately address potential downward pricing pressures and other factors that may adversely affect our operations and profitability 

numerous competitive factors could impair our ability to maintain our current profitability these factors include but are not limited to the following 

 

  

  

  

  

  

   

 if our employees were to unionize our operating costs would increase and our ability to compete would be impaired 

none of our employees are currently represented by a collective bargaining agreement however from time to time there have been efforts to organize our employees at various service centers we can make no assurance that our employees will not unionize in the future which could in turn have a material adverse effect on our operating results because 

 

  

  

  

  

 these factors and unionization of our workforce generally could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

if we are unable to successfully execute our growth strategy our business and future results of operations may suffer 

our growth strategy includes increasing the volume of freight moving through our existing service center network selectively expanding our geographic footprint and broadening the scope of our service offerings in connection with our growth strategy we have purchased additional equipment expanded and upgraded service centers hired additional personnel and increased our sales and marketing efforts and expect to continue to do so our growth strategy exposes us to a number of risks including the following 

 

  

  

  

  

  

 we cannot assure that we will overcome the risks associated with our growth if we fail to overcome those risks we may not realize additional revenue or profits from our efforts we may incur additional expenses and therefore our financial position and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 

  

insurance and claims expenses could significantly reduce our profitability 

we are exposed to claims related to cargo loss and damage property damage personal injury workers’ compensation longterm disability and group health we have insurance coverage with thirdparty insurance carriers but selfinsure a portion of the risk associated with these claims if the number or severity of claims for which we are selfinsured increases or we are required to accrue or pay additional amounts because the claims prove to be more severe than our original assessment our operating results would be adversely affected in addition insurance companies require us to obtain letters of credit to collateralize our selfinsured retention if these requirements increase our borrowing capacity could be adversely affected 

we may be subject to other lawsuits and claims relating to our services 

we cannot be sure that third parties will not assert claims against us with respect to existing and future services any litigation to determine the validity of any third party’s claims could result in significant expense and liability to us and divert the efforts of our management and other personnel whether or not the litigation is determined in our favor or covered by insurance 

our business is subject to general economic factors that are largely out of our control 

economic conditions may adversely affect our customers’ business levels the amount of transportation services they need and their ability to pay for our services customers encountering adverse economic conditions represent a greater potential for bad debt losses which may require us to increase our reserve for bad debt in addition because we selfinsure a substantial portion of our group health expense increases in healthcare costs and pharmaceutical expenses can adversely affect our financial results our results also may be negatively affected by increases in interest rates which can increase our borrowing costs and can negatively affect the level of economic activity by our customers and thus our freight volumes 

we have significant ongoing cash requirements that could limit our growth and affect our profitability if we are unable to obtain sufficient financing 

our business is highly capital intensive our purchases of property and equipment in 2007 and 2006 were 186828000 and 199098000 respectively we expect our net capital expenditures for 2008 to be approximately 155000000 to 165000000 we depend on cash flow from operations lines of credit and senior debt to finance our tractors trailers and service centers if we are unable in the future to raise sufficient capital or borrow sufficient funds to make these purchases we will be forced to limit our growth and operate our trucks for longer periods of time which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results 

in addition our business has significant operating cash requirements if our cash requirements are high or our cash flow from operations is low during particular periods we may need to seek additional financing which may be costly or difficult to obtain we entered into a fiveyear 225000000 senior unsecured revolving credit facility dated august 10 2006 with wachovia bank national association serving as administrative agent for the lenders that we believe provides us with a sufficient source for borrowing as needed 

we may be adversely impacted by fluctuations in the price and availability of diesel fuel 

diesel fuel is a significant operating expense we do not hedge against the risk of diesel fuel price increases an increase in diesel fuel prices or diesel fuel taxes or any change in federal or state regulations that results in such an increase could have a material adverse effect on our operating results unless the increase is offset by increases in freight rates or fuel surcharges charged to our customers historically we have been able to offset significant increases in diesel fuel prices through fuel surcharges to our customers but we cannot be certain that we will be able to do so in the future 

  

from time to time we may experience shortages in the availability of diesel fuel at certain locations and may be forced to incur additional expense to ensure adequate supply on a timely basis to prevent a disruption to our service schedules an interruption in the supply of diesel fuel could have a material adverse effect on our operating results 

difficulty in attracting drivers could affect our profitability 

competition for drivers is intense within the trucking industry and we periodically experience difficulties in attracting and retaining qualified drivers our operations may be affected by a shortage of qualified drivers in the future which could cause us to temporarily underutilize our fleet face difficulty in meeting shipper demands and increase our compensation levels for drivers if we encounter difficulty in attracting or retaining qualified drivers our ability to service our customers and increase our revenue could be adversely affected 

limited supply and increased prices for new equipment may adversely affect our earnings and cash flow 

investment in new equipment is a significant part of our annual capital expenditures we may face difficulty in purchasing new equipment due to decreased supply the price of our equipment may also be adversely affected in the future by regulations on newly manufactured tractors and diesel engines see the risk factor below entitled “we are subject to various environmental laws and regulations and costs of compliance with liabilities under or violations of existing or future environmental laws or regulations could adversely affect our business” 

we are subject to various environmental laws and regulations and costs of compliance with liabilities under or violations of existing or future environmental laws or regulations could adversely affect our business 

we are subject to various federal state and local environmental laws and regulations that govern among other things the emission and discharge of hazardous materials into the environment the presence of hazardous materials at our properties or in our vehicles fuel storage tanks the transportation of certain materials and the discharge or retention of storm water under certain environmental laws we could also be held responsible for any costs relating to contamination at our past or present facilities and at thirdparty waste disposal sites environmental laws have become and are expected to continue to be increasingly more stringent over time and there can be no assurance that our costs of complying with current or future environmental laws or liabilities arising under such laws will not have a material adverse effect on our business operations or financial condition 

the environmental protection agency has issued regulations that require progressive reductions in exhaust emissions from diesel engines through 2010 beginning in october 2002 new diesel engines were required to meet these new emission limits some of the regulations required reductions in the sulfur content of diesel fuel beginning in june 2006 and the introduction of emissions aftertreatment devices on newlymanufactured engines and vehicles beginning with model year 2007 our new tractor purchases in 2008 will include engines with the aftertreatment devices however we plan to use three different brands of these engines to evaluate which brand best meets our needs of performance and reliability the majority of our new tractor purchases in 2007 have engines manufactured prior to 2007 without these devices which was permitted under the regulations these regulations have resulted in higher prices for tractors and diesel engines and increased fuel and maintenance costs these adverse effects combined with the uncertainty as to the reliability of the vehicles equipped with the newly designed diesel engines and the residual values that will be realized from the disposition of these vehicles could increase our costs or otherwise adversely affect our business and operations 

we operate in a highly regulated industry and increased costs of compliance with or liability for violation of existing or future regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business 

we are regulated by the dot and by various state agencies these regulatory authorities have broad powers generally governing matters such as authority to engage in motor carrier operations safety and fitness of 

  

transportation equipment and drivers driver hours of service and periodic financial reporting in addition the trucking industry is subject to regulatory and legislative changes from a variety of other governmental authorities which address matters such as i increasingly stringent environmental occupational safety and health regulations and ii limits on vehicle weight and size regulatory requirements and changes in regulatory requirements may affect our business or the economics of the industry by requiring changes in operating practices or by influencing the demand for and the costs of providing transportation services 

our results of operations may be affected by seasonal factors and harsh weather conditions 

our operations are subject to seasonal trends common in the trucking industry our operating results in the first quarter are normally lower due to reduced demand during the winter months harsh weather can also adversely affect our performance by reducing demand and reducing our ability to transport freight which could result in increased operating expenses 

if we are unable to retain our key employees our financial condition results of operations and cash flows could be harmed 

our success will continue to depend upon the experience and leadership of our key employees and executive officers in that regard the loss of the services of any of our key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operation and cash flows 

our principal shareholders control a large portion of our outstanding common stock 

earl e congdon john r congdon and members of their respective families beneficially own approximately onethird of the outstanding shares of our common stock as long as the congdon family controls a large portion of our voting stock they will be able to significantly influence the election of the entire board of directors and the outcome of all matters involving a shareholder vote the congdon family’s interests may differ from other shareholders 

our information technology systems are subject to certain risks that we cannot control 

our information systems including our accounting systems are dependent upon thirdparty software global communications providers telephone systems and other aspects of technology and internet infrastructure that are susceptible to failure though we have implemented redundant systems and network security measures our information technology remains susceptible to outages computer viruses breakins and similar disruptions that may inhibit our ability to provide services to our customers and the ability of our customers to access our systems this may result in the loss of customers or a reduction in demand for our services

 item 2 properties 

we own our general office located in thomasville north carolina consisting of a twostory office building of approximately 160000 square feet on 236 acres of land at december 31 2007 we operated 192 service centers of which 97 were owned and 95 were leased we own all of our major breakbulk facilities which are listed below with the number of doors as of december 31 2007 

 

 these facilities are strategically dispersed over the states in which we operate at december 31 2007 the terms of our leased properties ranged from monthtomonth to a lease that expires in 2021 we believe that as current leases expire we will be able to renew them or find comparable facilities without incurring any material negative impact on service to our customers or our operating results 

we also own thirteen nonoperating properties all of which are held for lease six of these properties are leased with lease terms that range from monthtomonth to a lease that expires in 2011 

we believe that all of our properties are in good repair and are capable of providing the level of service required by current business levels and customer demands 




 item 3 legal proceedings 

we are involved in various legal proceedings and claims that have arisen in the ordinary course of our business that have not been fully adjudicated many of these are covered in whole or in part by insurance our management does not believe that these actions when finally concluded and determined will have a material adverse effect upon our financial position or results of operations 

on july 30 2007 the company was named in a putative class action complaint against us and 10 other major ltl motor carriers and large transportation companies offering ltl services together the “defendants” this complaint alleges that the defendants conspired to restrain trade in violation of section 1 of the sherman act in connection with fuel surcharges to customers and seeks injunctive relief treble damages and attorneys’ fees subsequent to this original complaint similar complaints have been filed against the defendants and other ltl motor carriers each with the same allegation of conspiracy to fix fuel surcharge rates on december 20 2007 these cases were consolidated in the united states district court for the northern district of georgia and are now in the process of being transferred to that court due to the nature and status of these claims we cannot determine the likelihood of an adverse outcome nor an amount or reasonable range of potential loss if any in these matters we believe that these allegations have no merit and intend to vigorously defend ourselves

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact the consolidated financial position results of operations and cash flows due to adverse changes in financial market prices and rates 

we are exposed to interest rate risk directly related to loans under our senior unsecured revolving credit agreements which have variable interest rates a 100 basis point increase in the average interest rate on this agreement would have no material effect on our operating results we have established policies and procedures to manage exposure to market risks and use major institutions that are creditworthy to minimize credit risk 

we are exposed to interest rate and market risk related to our shortterm investments which includes variable rate demand obligations and auction rate securities however we invest in high quality investment grade securities with interest reset periods generally between 1 to 35 days a 100 basis point decrease in the average 

  

interest rate on our shortterm investments would have no material effect on our operating results at december 31 2007 our balance of shortterm investments was 24375000 of which 20375000 was rated aaa andor aaa by standard and poors “sp” and moody’s respectively the remaining 4000000 was rated aa by sp due to recent negative publicity surrounding the auction rate security market the company reduced its exposure to this type of investment to 4500000 at february 28 2008 without a realized gain or loss and invested its excess cash in money market funds that are included in cash and equivalents we do not believe any of the remaining balance of auction rate securities are impaired due to quality of the underlying securities and we have the intent and ability to hold these securities until they reset in the event of an auction failure 

we are exposed to market risk for equity investments relating to company owned life insurance contracts on certain employees at december 31 2007 the cash value for variable life insurance contracts was 8162000 of the total 13295000 of cash values for all life insurance contracts included on our balance sheet in “other assets” variable life insurance contracts expose the company to fluctuations in equity markets however we utilize a thirdparty to manage these assets and minimize that exposure a 10 change in market value in those investments would have an 816200 impact on our operating results 

we are also exposed to commodity price risk related to diesel fuel prices and have established policies and procedures to manage our exposure to that risk

general 

we are a leading lessthantruckload “ltl” multiregional motor carrier providing onetofive day service among five regions in the united states and nextday and secondday service within these regions we operate as one business segment and offer an expanding array of innovative products and services through our four branded product groups oddomestic odexpedited odglobal and odtechnology at december 31 2006 we provided fullstate coverage to 37 of the 47 states that we served directly within the southeast south central northeast midwest and west regions of the country through marketing and carrier relationships we also provided service to and from the remaining states as well as international services around the globe we plan to continue to expand our service center network as opportunities arise to achieve our strategic goal of providing fullstate coverage throughout the continental united states these additions should also provide a platform for future growth and ensure that our service center network has sufficient capacity 

we have grown substantially over the last several years through strategic acquisitions and internal growth prior to 1995 we provided interregional service to major metropolitan areas from and regional service within the southeast region of the united states since 1995 we have expanded our infrastructure to provide nextday and secondday service within four additional regions as well as expanded interregional service among those regions from 1995 through december 31 2006 we increased our number of service centers from 53 to 182 and our states directly served from 21 to 47 we believe that our present infrastructure will enable us to increase freight density which is to increase the volume of freight moving through our network and thereby improve our profitability 

we are committed to providing our customers with high quality service we are continually upgrading our technological capabilities to improve customer service reduce our transit times and minimize our operating costs in addition to our core ltl services we provide other specialized services including premium expedited services truckload services truckload brokerage services logistical solutions container delivery service to and from ten port facilities and distribution services in which we either consolidate ltl shipments for full truckload transport by a truckload carrier or convert full truckload shipments from a truckload carrier into ltl shipments for our delivery 

we provide consistent customer service from a single organization offering our customers information and pricing from one point of contact our multiregional competitors that offer interregional service typically do so through independent companies or with separate points of contact within different operating segments of the 

  

company which can result in inconsistent service and pricing as well as poor shipment visibility our integrated structure allows us to offer our customers consistent and continuous service across all areas of operations and service products 

old dominion was founded in 1934 and incorporated in virginia in 1950 please refer to the balance sheets and statements of operations included in item 8 of this report for information regarding our total assets revenue from operations and net income 

our industry 

trucks provide transportation services to virtually every industry operating in the united states and generally offer higher levels of reliability and faster transit times than other surface transportation options the trucking industry is comprised principally of two types of motor carriers truckload and ltl truckload carriers generally provide an entire trailer to one customer from origin to destination ltl carriers pick up multiple shipments from multiple customers on a single truck and then route the goods through service centers where freight may be transferred to other trucks with similar destinations for delivery 

in contrast to truckload carriers ltl motor carriers require expansive networks of local pickup and delivery service centers as well as larger breakbulk or hub facilities the significant capital that ltl motor carriers must commit to create and maintain a network of service centers and a fleet of tractors and trailers makes it difficult for new startup or small operations to effectively compete with established companies in addition successful ltl motor carriers generally employ a high level of technology to provide information to customers and to reduce operating costs 

service center operations 

at december 31 2006 we conducted operations through 182 service center locations of which we own 88 and lease 94 we operate major breakbulk facilities in atlanta georgia rialto california indianapolis indiana greensboro north carolina harrisburg pennsylvania memphis and morristown tennessee and dallas texas while using some smaller service centers for limited breakbulk activity in order to serve nextday markets our service centers are strategically located in five regions of the country to provide the highest quality service and minimize freight rehandling costs 

each of our service centers is responsible for the pickup and delivery of freight for its service area each service center loads outbound freight by destination the day it is picked up all inbound freight received by the service center in the evening or during the night is scheduled for local delivery the next business day unless a customer requests a different delivery schedule our management reviews the productivity and service performance of each service center on a daily basis to ensure quality service and efficient operations 

while we have established primary responsibility for customer service at the local service center level our customers may access information and initiate transactions through several different gateways such as our website electronic data interchange automated voice response systems automated fax systems or through our customer service department located at the corporate office our systems offer direct access to information such as freight tracking shipping documents rate quotes rate databases and account activity 

linehaul transportation 

linehaul dispatchers control the movement of freight among service centers through integrated freight movement systems we also utilize loadplanning software to optimize efficiencies in our linehaul operations our senior management continuously monitors freight movements transit times load factors and other productivity measurements to ensure that we maintain our highest levels of service and efficiency 

we utilize scheduled routes and additional linehaul dispatches as necessary to meet our published service standards in addition we lower our cost structure by maintaining flexible work force rules and by primarily 

  

using twin 28foot trailers exclusively in our linehaul operations the use of twin 28foot trailers permits us to transport freight directly from its point of origin to destination with minimal unloading and reloading which also reduces cargo claims expenses we also utilize longcombination vehicles such as triple 28foot trailers and combinations of 48foot and 28foot trailers in states where permitted twin trailers and longcombination vehicles permit more freight to be hauled behind a tractor than could be hauled by one larger trailer 

tractors trailers and maintenance 

at december 31 2006 we operated 4643 tractors we generally use new tractors in linehaul operations for approximately three to five years and then transfer those tractors to pickup and delivery operations for the remainder of the assets’ useful lives in a number of our service centers tractors perform pickup and delivery functions during the day and linehaul functions at night to maximize tractor utilization 

at december 31 2006 we operated a fleet of 17915 trailers we primarily purchase new trailers for our operations however we occasionally purchase preowned equipment meeting our specifications from other trucking companies 

we have also acquired tractors and trailers through our acquisition of business assets from other carriers the purchase of preowned equipment can provide an excellent value but can increase our fleet’s average age the table below reflects as of december 31 2006 the average age of our tractors and trailers 

 

 we develop certain specifications for tractors and trailers the production and purchase of which are negotiated with several manufacturers these purchases are planned well in advance of anticipated delivery dates in order to accommodate manufacturers’ production schedules we believe that there is sufficient capacity among suppliers to ensure an uninterrupted supply of equipment to support our operations and planned growth 

the table below sets forth our capital expenditures for tractors and trailers for the years ended december 31 2006 2005 and 2004 our capital expenditures for tractors and trailers in 2006 provided the capacity to support our continued growth and geographic expansion and to a lesser extent to replace equipment as part of our normal replacement cycle 

 

 at december 31 2006 we had major maintenance operations at our service centers in los angeles and rialto california denver colorado atlanta georgia chicago illinois indianapolis indiana parsons kansas jersey city new jersey greensboro north carolina columbus ohio harrisburg pennsylvania morristown and memphis tennessee dallas texas and salt lake city utah in addition nine other service center locations are equipped to perform routine and preventive maintenance and repairs on our equipment 

we have established maintenance policies and procedures linehaul tractors are routed to appropriate maintenance facilities at designated mileage or time intervals depending upon how the equipment was utilized pickup and delivery tractors and trailers are scheduled for maintenance every 90 days 

  

marketing and customers 

at december 31 2006 we had a sales staff of 428 employees we compensate our sales force in part based upon revenue generated company and service center profitability and ontime service performance which we believe helps to motivate our employees to achieve our service growth and profitability objectives 

we utilize a computerized freight costing model to determine the price level at which a particular shipment of freight will be profitable we can modify elements of this freight costing model to simulate the actual conditions under which the freight will be moved we also compete for business by participating in bid solicitations customers generally solicit bids for relatively large numbers of shipments for a period of one to two years and typically choose to enter into contractual arrangements with a limited number of motor carriers based upon price and service 

revenue is generated from many customers and locations across the united states and north america in 2006 our largest customer accounted for approximately 29 of revenue and our largest 20 10 and 5 customers accounted for approximately 228 153 and 96 of our revenue respectively for each of the previous three years less than 5 of our revenue was generated from international services we believe the diversity of our revenue base helps protect our business from adverse developments in a single geographic region and the reduction or loss of business from a single customer 

competition 

the transportation industry is highly competitive on the basis of both price and service at december 31 2006 we were the seventh largest ltl carrier in the united states as measured by revenue we compete with regional interregional and national ltl carriers and to a lesser extent with truckload carriers small package carriers airfreight carriers and railroads competition is based primarily on personal relationships price and service we believe that we are able to compete effectively in our markets by providing high quality and timely service at competitive prices 

we believe our transit times are generally faster than those of our principal national competitors we believe this performance is due in part to our more efficient service center network use of team drivers and investment in technology in addition we provide greater geographic coverage than most of our regional competitors we believe our diversified mix and scope of regional and interregional services enable us to provide our customers with a single source to meet their ltl shipping needs and provides us with a distinct advantage over our regional multiregional and national competition 

we also believe our nonunion workforce gives us a significant advantage over our unionized ltl competition advantages of our workforce include flexible hours and the ability of our employees to perform multiple tasks which we believe result in greater productivity customer service efficiency and cost savings 

we compete with several larger transportation service providers each of which may have more equipment a broader coverage network and a wider range of services than we do our larger competitors also have greater financial resources and in general the ability to reduce prices to gain business especially during times of reduced growth rates in the economy this could potentially limit our ability to maintain or increase prices or maintain significant growth 

seasonality 

our tonnage levels and revenue mix are subject to seasonal trends common in the motor carrier industry financial results in the first quarter are normally lower due to reduced shipments during the winter months harsh winter weather can also adversely impact our performance by reducing demand and increasing operating expenses freight volumes typically build to a peak in the third quarter and early fourth quarter which generally result in improved operating margins 

  

technology 

we continually upgrade our technological capabilities and we provide access to our systems through multiple gateways that offer our customers maximum flexibility and immediate access to information we also employ freight handling systems and logistics technology to reduce costs and transit times our principal technologies include 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

   

insurance 

we carry significant insurance with thirdparty insurance carriers and we selfinsure a portion of this risk we are currently selfinsured for bodily injury and property damage claims up to 2750000 per occurrence this selfinsured retention level was increased from 2500000 during the previous plan year ended march 30 2006 cargo loss and damage claims are selfinsured up to 100000 per occurrence we are exposed to workers’ compensation claims up to 1000000 per occurrence through either selfinsurance or insurance deductibles for the states in which we operate group health claims are selfinsured up to 300000 per occurrence and longterm disability claims are selfinsured to a maximum per individual of 3000 per month 

we believe that our policy of selfinsuring a portion of our risk together with our safety and loss prevention programs is an effective means of managing insurance costs we also believe that our current insurance coverage is adequate to cover our liability risks 

diesel fuel availability and cost 

our industry depends heavily upon the availability of diesel fuel from time to time we may experience shortages at certain locations and have been forced to incur additional expense to ensure adequate supply on a timely basis to prevent a disruption to our service schedules we have experienced higher diesel fuel costs in recent years and as a result implemented a fuel surcharge program in august 1999 that has remained in effect since that time our fuel surcharges which are generally indexed to the us department of energy’s published fuel prices were implemented to offset the additional cost of diesel fuel and are consistent with our competitors’ practices our management believes that our operations and financial condition are susceptible to the same diesel fuel price increases or shortages as those of our competitors diesel fuel costs including fuel taxes totaled 132 of revenue in 2006 

employees 

as of december 31 2006 we employed 10762 individuals on a fulltime basis in the following categories 

 

 as of december 31 2006 we employed 2573 linehaul drivers and 2914 pickup and delivery drivers all of our drivers are selected based upon driving records and experience drivers are required to pass drug tests and have a current united states department of transportation “dot” physical and a valid commercial driver’s license prior to employment once employed drivers are required to obtain and maintain hazardous materials endorsements to their commercial driver’s licenses drivers are also required to take drug and alcohol tests periodically by random selection 

to help fulfill driver needs we offer qualified employees the opportunity to become drivers through the “old dominion driver training program” since its inception in 1988 2125 individuals have graduated from this program from which we have experienced an annual turnover rate of approximately 7 we believe our driver training and qualification programs have been important factors in improving our safety record drivers with safe driving records are rewarded with bonuses of up to 1000 annually driver safety bonuses paid during 2006 were 996000 

our focus on communication and the continued education development and motivation of our employees helps to ensure that our relationship with our employees remains excellent there are no employees represented under a collective bargaining agreement which we believe is an important factor in our continued success 

  

governmental regulation 

we are regulated by the surface transportation board an agency within the dot and by various state agencies these regulatory authorities have broad powers generally governing matters such as authority to engage in motor carrier operations hours of service certain mergers consolidations and acquisitions and periodic financial reporting the trucking industry is subject to regulatory and legislative changes such as increasingly stringent environmental and occupational safety and health regulations limits on vehicle weight and size ergonomics and hours of service these changes may affect the economics of our industry by requiring changes in operating practices increasing our cost and influencing the demand for our services 

we believe that the cost of compliance with applicable laws and regulations has not and will not materially affect our results of operations or financial condition 

environmental regulation 

we are subject to various federal state and local environmental laws and regulations that focus on the transportation of certain materials the discharge or retention of storm water and the emission and discharge of hazardous materials into the environment or their presence on or in our properties vehicles and fuel storage tanks under certain environmental laws we could also be held responsible for any costs relating to contamination at our past or present facilities and at thirdparty waste disposal sites we do not believe that the cost of future compliance with environmental laws or regulations will have a material adverse effect on our operations financial condition competitive position or capital expenditures for the remainder of fiscal 2007 or fiscal 2008 




 item 1a risk factors 

in addition to the factors discussed elsewhere in this report the following are some of the important factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those projected in any forwardlooking statements 

we operate in a highly competitive industry and our business will suffer if we are unable to adequately address potential downward pricing pressures and other factors that may adversely affect our operations and profitability 

numerous competitive factors could impair our ability to maintain our current profitability these factors include but are not limited to the following 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

   

if our employees were to unionize our operating costs would increase and our ability to compete would be impaired 

none of our employees are currently represented by a collective bargaining agreement however from time to time there have been efforts to organize our employees at various service centers we can make no assurance that our employees will not unionize in the future which could in turn have a material adverse effect on our operating results because 

 

  

  

  

 these results and unionization of our workforce generally could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

if we are unable to successfully execute our growth strategy our business and future results of operations may suffer 

our growth strategy includes increasing the volume of freight moving through our existing service center network selectively expanding our geographic footprint and broadening the scope of our service offerings in connection with our growth strategy we have purchased additional equipment expanded and upgraded service centers hired additional personnel and increased our sales and marketing efforts and expect to continue to do so our growth strategy exposes us to a number of risks including the following 

 

  

  

  

  

  

 we cannot assure that we will overcome the risks associated with our growth if we fail to overcome those risks we may not realize additional revenue or profits from our efforts we may incur additional expenses and therefore our financial position and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 

difficulty in attracting drivers could affect our profitability 

competition for drivers is intense within the trucking industry and we periodically experience difficulties in attracting and retaining qualified drivers our operations may be affected by a shortage of qualified drivers in the future which could cause us to temporarily underutilize our fleet face difficulty in meeting shipper demands 

  

and increase our compensation levels for drivers if we encounter difficulty in attracting or retaining qualified drivers our ability to service our customers and increase our revenue could be adversely affected 

insurance and claims expenses could significantly reduce our profitability 

we are exposed to claims related to cargo loss and damage property damage personal injury workers’ compensation longterm disability and group health we carry significant insurance with thirdparty insurance carriers the cost of which has risen significantly in recent years to offset in part the significant increases we have experienced we have elected to increase our selfinsured retention levels for most of our risk exposures if the number or severity of claims for which we are selfinsured increases or we are required to accrue or pay additional amounts because the claims prove to be more severe than our original assessment our operating results would be adversely affected in addition insurance companies require us to obtain letters of credit to collateralize our selfinsured retention if these requirements increase our borrowing capacity could be adversely affected 

our business is subject to general economic factors that are largely out of our control 

economic conditions may adversely affect our customers’ business levels the amount of transportation services they need and their ability to pay for our services customers encountering adverse economic conditions represent a greater potential for bad debt losses which may require us to increase our reserve for bad debt in addition because we selfinsure a substantial portion of our group health expense increases in healthcare costs and pharmaceutical expenses can adversely affect our financial results our results also may be negatively affected by increases in interest rates which increase our borrowing costs and can negatively affect the level of economic activity by our customers and thus our freight volumes 

we have significant ongoing cash requirements that could limit our growth and affect our profitability if we are unable to obtain sufficient financing 

our business is highly capital intensive our net capital expenditures including the acquisition of business assets in 2006 and 2005 were 212886000 and 160488000 respectively we expect our capital expenditures for 2007 to be approximately 245000000 to 255000000 the increase in our capital expenditures for 2007 is primarily due to planned real estate acquisitions and improvements to increase capacity at our existing service centers which we believe are necessary in order for us to achieve our growth strategy we depend on operating leases lines of credit senior debt and cash flow from operations to finance our tractors trailers and service centers if we are unable in the future to raise sufficient capital or borrow sufficient funds to make these purchases we will be forced to limit our growth and operate our trucks for longer periods of time which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results 

in addition our business has significant operating cash requirements if our cash requirements are high or our cash flow from operations is low during particular periods we may need to seek additional financing which may be costly or difficult to obtain we entered into a fiveyear 225000000 senior unsecured revolving credit facility dated august 10 2006 with wachovia bank national association serving as administrative agent for the lenders that we believe provides us with a sufficient source for borrowing as needed 

we may be adversely impacted by fluctuations in the price and availability of diesel fuel 

diesel fuel is a significant operating expense we do not hedge against the risk of diesel fuel price increases any increase in diesel fuel prices or diesel fuel taxes or any change in federal or state regulations that results in such an increase to the extent not offset by freight rate increases or fuel surcharges to customers or any interruption in the supply of diesel fuel could have a material adverse effect on our operating results historically we have been able to offset significant increases in diesel fuel prices through fuel surcharges to our customers but we cannot be certain that we will be able to do so in the future from time to time we may experience shortages in the availability of diesel fuel at certain locations and may be forced to incur additional expense to ensure adequate supply on a timely basis to prevent a disruption to our service schedules 

  

limited supply and increased prices for new equipment may adversely affect our earnings and cash flow 

investment in new equipment is a significant part of our annual capital expenditures we may face difficulty in purchasing new equipment due to decreased supply the price of our equipment may also be adversely affected in the future by regulations on newly manufactured tractors and diesel engines see the risk factor below entitled “we are subject to various environmental laws and regulations and costs of compliance with liabilities under or violations of existing or future environmental laws or regulations could adversely affect our business” 

we operate in a highly regulated industry and increased costs of compliance with or liability for violation of existing or future regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business 

we are regulated by the dot and by various state agencies these regulatory authorities have broad powers generally governing matters such as authority to engage in motor carrier operations safety and fitness of transportation equipment and drivers driver hours of service and periodic financial reporting in addition the trucking industry is subject to regulatory and legislative changes from a variety of other governmental authorities which address matters such as increasingly stringent environmental occupational safety and health regulations or limits on vehicle weight and size and ergonomics regulatory requirements and changes in regulatory requirements may affect our business or the economics of the industry by requiring changes in operating practices or by influencing the demand for and the costs of providing transportation services 

we are subject to various environmental laws and regulations and costs of compliance with liabilities under or violations of existing or future environmental laws or regulations could adversely affect our business 

we are subject to various federal state and local environmental laws and regulations regulating among other things the emission and discharge of hazardous materials into the environment or presence on or in our properties and vehicles fuel storage tanks our transportation of certain materials and the discharge or retention of storm water under certain environmental laws we could also be held responsible for any costs relating to contamination at our past or present facilities and at thirdparty waste disposal sites environmental laws have become and are expected to continue to be increasingly more stringent over time and there can be no assurance that our costs of complying with current or future environmental laws or liabilities arising under such laws will not have a material adverse effect on our business operations or financial condition 

the environmental protection agency has issued regulations that require progressive reductions in exhaust emissions from diesel engines through 2007 beginning in october 2002 new diesel engines were required to meet these new emission limits some of the regulations required reductions in the sulfur content of diesel fuel beginning in june 2006 and the introduction of emissions aftertreatment devices on newlymanufactured engines and vehicles beginning with model year 2007 the majority of our new tractor purchases in 2007 are expected to have engines manufactured prior to 2007 without these devices which is permitted under the new regulations these regulations have resulted in higher prices for tractors and diesel engines and increased fuel and maintenance costs these adverse effects combined with the uncertainty as to the reliability of the vehicles equipped with the newly designed diesel engines and the residual values that will be realized from the disposition of these vehicles could increase our costs or otherwise adversely affect our business and operations 

our results of operations may be affected by seasonal factors and harsh weather conditions 

our operations are subject to seasonal trends common in the trucking industry our operating results in the first quarter are normally lower due to reduced demand during the winter months harsh weather can also adversely affect our performance by reducing demand and reducing our ability to transport freight which could result in increased operating expenses 

if we are unable to retain our key employees our financial condition results of operations and cash flows could be harmed 

our success will continue to depend upon the experience and leadership of our key employees and executive officers in that regard the loss of the services of any of our key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operation and cash flows 

  

our principal shareholders control a large portion of our outstanding common stock 

as of february 26 2007 earl e congdon and john r congdon and members of their families and their affiliates beneficially owned 322 of the outstanding shares of our common stock as long as the congdon family controls a large portion of our voting stock they will be able to significantly influence the election of the entire board of directors and the outcome of all matters involving a shareholder vote the congdon family’s interests may differ from other shareholders

 item 2 properties 

we own our general office located in thomasville north carolina consisting of a twostory office building of approximately 160000 square feet on 236 acres of land at december 31 2006 we operated 182 service centers of which 88 were owned and 94 were leased we own all of our major breakbulk facilities which are listed below with the number of doors as of december 31 2006 

 

 these facilities are strategically dispersed over the states in which we operate at december 31 2006 the length of our 94 leased properties ranges from monthtomonth to a lease that expires in 2018 we believe that as current leases expire we will be able to renew them or find comparable facilities without incurring any material negative impact on service to our customers or our operating results 

we also own twelve nonoperating properties all of which are held for lease four of these properties are currently leased with monthtomonth lease terms 

we believe that all of our properties are in good repair and are capable of providing the level of service required by current business levels and customer demands 




 item 3 legal proceedings 

we are involved in various legal proceedings and claims that have arisen in the ordinary course of our business that have not been fully adjudicated many of these are covered in whole or in part by insurance our management does not believe that these actions when finally concluded and determined will have a material adverse effect upon our financial position or results of operations

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

overview 

we are a leading nonunion lessthantruckload “ltl” multiregional motor carrier providing onetofive day service among five regions in the united states and nextday and secondday service within these regions historically over 90 of our revenue is derived from transporting ltl shipments for our customers whose demand for our services is generally tied to the overall health of the us domestic economy 

in analyzing the components of our revenue we monitor changes and trends in the following key metrics 

 

  

  

  

 our primary revenue focus is to increase shipment and tonnage growth within our existing infrastructure generally referred to as increasing density thereby maximizing asset utilization and labor productivity we measure density over many different functional areas of our operations including revenue per service center linehaul load factor pd stops per hour pd shipments per hour and platform pounds handled per hour we believe continued improvement in density is a key component in our ability to sustain profitable growth 

our primary cost elements are direct wages and benefits associated with the movement of freight operating supplies and expenses and depreciation of our equipment fleet and service center facilities we gauge our overall success in managing these costs by monitoring our operating ratio a measure of profitability calculated by dividing total operating expenses by revenue which also allows industrywide comparisons with our competition 

we continually upgrade our technological capabilities to improve our customer service and lower our operating costs this technology provides our customers with visibility of their shipments throughout our systems while providing key metrics from which we can monitor our processes 

  

results of operations 

the following table sets forth for the years indicated expenses and other items as a percentage of revenue from operations 

 

  2006 compared to 2005 

key financial and operating metrics for 2006 and 2005 are presented below 

 

 in 2006 and for the third consecutive year we produced revenue growth in excess of 20 and growth in diluted earnings per share in excess of 30 we maintained our revenue focus on increasing density which resulted in producing over 90 of our revenue from service centers open for more than one year and a 37 increase in average revenue per service center the operating leverage we generated resulted in continued improvement in our operating ratio to 898 which is the first time we have operated below 900 in our fifteen years as a public company and is our fifth consecutive year of improvement 

  

our revenue growth in 2006 was the result of an 118 growth in shipments and a 78 increase in revenue per shipment the increase in revenue per shipment consists of increases in both revenue per hundredweight and weight per shipment of 42 and 34 respectively from 2005 the combination of increases in shipments and weight per shipment produced 156 tonnage growth over 2005 we believe our growth particularly in existing markets is attributable to our ability to offer a onesource solution for shippers’ regional and interregional needs by providing these services through one company in contrast to many of our principal competitors additionally the expansion of our geographic footprint as well as increased fullstate coverage has positioned us to be attractive to more and more shippers 

while most of our revenue growth is derived from service centers open for more than one year the expansion of our service center network and improvement in our service capabilities should provide a platform for future growth we increased the total number of service centers in our network to 182 at december 31 2006 from 154 at december 31 2005 revenue growth from geographic expansion typically results in additional freight moving through our existing service center network which helps to offset higher operating margins that typically accompany new service center openings seven of the service centers opened in 2006 were spinoffs of existing service centers to improve service and create additional capacity for growth due to the established customer base and operating presence in those markets we were able to operate those spinoffs profitably within a shorter period of time than traditional openings in new geographic territories 

revenue per hundredweight increased 42 to 1316 from 1263 in 2005 this pricing improvement reflects the general rate increase on our base rates and minimum charges for certain tariffs effective april 17 2006 and occurred despite the increase in weight per shipment which generally has the effect of reducing revenue per hundredweight this pricing improvement demonstrates a stable economy and pricing environment throughout most of 2006 and our ability to maintain pricing discipline while increasing the volume of freight moving through our service center network we experienced a decline in the fourth quarter of 2006 in weight per shipment and a slowdown in our tonnage growth which are consistent with market indicators of a slowing economy and the reported results of others in our industry if these trends continue pricing pressures could become more prevalent in the marketplace and our growth in revenue and net income could slow in comparison to the historical annual growth rates however we believe that we can maintain operational efficiencies to continue our trend of comparable quarter improvement in our operating ratio even in a period of slower growth 

our tariffs and contracts generally provide for a fuel surcharge as diesel fuel prices increase above stated levels that are generally indexed to the us department of energy’s published fuel prices which is consistent with industry practice this surcharge is recorded as additional revenue and was implemented to offset significant fluctuations in the price of diesel fuel which is one of the larger components of our operating supplies and expenses because of the sustained increase in diesel fuel costs and other petroleumbased products our freight pricing strategy as well as that in the ltl industry has evolved and the fuel surcharge is one of many components in the overall price for our transportation services as a result the fuel surcharge often represents more than just the pass through of increased diesel fuel cost because of average higher diesel fuel prices in 2006 and the evolution of our freight pricing strategy the fuel surcharge increased to 119 of revenue from 103 in 2005 a rapid and significant decrease in diesel fuel prices would likely reduce our revenue and operating income until we revised our pricing strategy to reflect these changes 

much of the overall improvement in our operating ratio was achieved by the improvement in salaries wages and benefits as a percent of revenue which decreased to 534 of revenue in 2006 from 552 of revenue in 2005 this improvement primarily resulted from a decrease in benefit costs to 115 of revenue from 124 in 2005 workers compensation expenses decreased 12 as a percent of revenue from 2005 as a result of favorable claims experience and a favorable adjustment to our reserve for unpaid claims following an independent actuarial review conducted in the fourth quarter of 2006 these improvements were somewhat offset by a 03 increase as a percent of revenue in benefit costs resulting from enhancements to our vacation policy and additional costs to provide group health benefits to our employees 

  

in addition to the improvement in benefit costs our salary and clerical wages decreased by 04 of revenue from 2005 as we leveraged our revenue growth over this segment of our workforce pd driver wages decreased by 02 of revenue from 2005 which can be attributed to a 29 improvement in our pd stops per hour we benefited from the additional density caused by growth in tonnage the efficiencies in our route planning through the use of our pd route optimization software and the use of our driver handheld computers platform wages also decreased by 02 of revenue from 2005 primarily due to a 63 increase in platform pounds handled per hour 

operating supplies and expenses increased to 160 of revenue in 2006 from 149 in 2005 this increase was primarily due to a 352 increase in diesel fuel costs excluding fuel taxes resulting from increased diesel fuel prices and a 165 increase in consumption the consumption increase resulted in an increase in our fuel taxes which primarily accounts for the change in our “operating taxes and licenses” we currently do not use diesel fuel hedging instruments therefore we are subject to market price fluctuations our fuel surcharge revenue more than offset our increased cost of diesel fuel in 2006 

we made significant investments in revenue equipment and real estate in 2005 and 2006 to support our growth and to prevent our fleet and service center network from becoming a limiting factor to our growth as a result depreciation and amortization remained consistent at 53 of revenue in 2006 and 2005 in addition building and office equipment rents also remained consistent at 09 of revenue in 2006 and 2005 

we purchase transportation services from other motor carriers and railroads for linehaul and pd services we also contract with lease operators for our container operations and incur shortterm rentals for tractors trailers and other revenueproducing equipment we primarily utilize these services when there are capacity restraints or imbalances of freight flow within our service center network or when it is economically beneficial purchased transportation increased slightly to 34 of revenue in 2006 from 33 in 2005 the increase is primarily due to the increased use of purchased linehaul services beginning in the second quarter of 2006 which became necessary in certain lanes because of our significant growth we were able to add a sufficient number of drivers in the third quarter of 2006 which allowed us to utilize our own equipment and decrease the use of purchased linehaul services as a result purchased linehaul services have returned to historical levels and represent an opportunity for additional operating leverage that may be obtained with the continued expansion of our network 

interest expense net of interest income increased to 10206000 for 2006 from 6527000 for 2005 this increase is primarily due to an increased average balance outstanding on our longterm debt resulting from the two separate issuances of privatelyplaced senior notes under the note purchase agreement entered into on april 25 2006 offset by the 2237000 of interest income earned on cash equivalents and shortterm investments the effective average taxequivalent yield excluding the statetax benefit on our shortterm investments was 568 for 2006 

our effective tax rate for 2006 was 392 compared to 403 in 2005 the decrease in our effective tax rate is due primarily to the taxexempt interest income earned on our cash equivalents and shortterm investments in 2006 due to our cash needs in 2007 to fund capital expenditures we expect our annual effective tax rate to be 398 in 2007 our effective tax rate exceeds the federal statutory rate of 35 primarily due to the impact of state taxes and to a lesser extent certain nondeductible items 

  

2005 compared to 2004 

key financial and operating metrics for 2005 and 2004 are presented below 

 

 the 288 growth in revenue we produced in 2005 was a primary driver of our financial performance for that year for the first time in our history we achieved revenue over 1 billion while extending a fouryear trend of producing doubledigit growth in revenue net income and diluted earnings per share our profitability was due primarily to our focus on growth in existing markets thereby leveraging our existing infrastructure and capacity as a result we lowered our operating ratio to 908 increased net income by 371 and increased diluted earnings per share by 349 

our revenue growth in 2005 was generated through an 184 growth in tonnage and an 88 increase in revenue per hundredweight the tonnage growth consists of increases in both shipments and weight per shipment of 169 and 12 respectively from 2004 we have achieved this growth primarily through expanding our business with existing customers and adding new customers in existing areas as well as launching new services and improving the quality of our service we believe that our continued geographic expansion as well as increased fullstate coverage has positioned us to be attractive to more and more shippers additionally we are able to offer a onesource solution to customers’ regional and interregional shipping needs by providing these services through one company in contrast to many of our principal competitors for these reasons combined with a stable economy and industry consolidation during 2005 we continued to gain market share and increase our revenues 

our average length of haul decreased from 937 in 2004 to 926 miles in 2005 reflecting higher growth in our shorterhaul regional lanes the growth in these shorterhaul lanes can be attributed to our evolving customer base our growing number of states with fullstate coverage and our focus on building our presence in regional markets we believe that our competitiveness in the nextday and twoday lanes presents us with further growth opportunities as these are the fastest growing markets in the industry due to the changing demands of shippers 

revenue per hundredweight increased to 1263 from 1161 in 2004 our tariffs and contracts generally provide for a fuel surcharge as diesel fuel prices increase above stated levels which is consistent with industry practice this surcharge is recorded as additional revenue and was implemented to offset significant fluctuations in the price of diesel fuel which is one of the larger components of our operating supplies and expenses because of the sustained increase in diesel fuel costs our freight pricing strategy as well as that in the industry has evolved and the fuel surcharge is one of many components in the overall price customers are willing to pay for transportation services as a result the fuel surcharge often represents more than just the pass through of increased diesel fuel cost because of average higher diesel fuel prices in 2005 and the evolution of our freight pricing strategy the fuel surcharge increased to 103 of revenue from 63 in 2004 our fuel surcharge revenue more than offset our increased cost of diesel fuel in 2005 a rapid and significant decrease in diesel fuel prices would likely reduce our revenue and operating income until we revised our pricing strategy to reflect these changes 

  

our pricing has remained relatively stable despite the increased weight per shipment and decreased length of haul which generally have the effect of reducing revenue per hundredweight the overall stability in our pricing demonstrates our ability to maintain our pricing discipline while increasing the volume of freight moving through our service center network 

we increased the total number of service centers in our network to 154 at december 31 2005 from 138 at december 31 2004 the expansion of our service center network and improvement in our service capabilities should provide a platform for future growth however the majority of our revenue growth for the years compared was generated from our existing service center network which contributed to a 136 increase in revenue per service center in 2005 and the continued improvement in our operating ratio the revenue growth from geographic expansion typically results in additional freight moving through our existing service center network which helps to offset higher operating margins that typically accompany new service center openings 

much of the overall improvement in our operating ratio was achieved by the improvement in salaries wages and benefits as a percent of revenue which decreased to 552 of revenue in 2005 from 569 of revenue in 2004 driver wages decreased to 218 of revenue from 229 of revenue in 2004 we saw continued improvement in our linehaul load averages and pd productivity in 2005 as reflected by our 96 improvement in revenue per linehaul mile and our 30 improvement in pd shipments handled per hour from 2004 we also experienced a similar improvement in platform labor which decreased to 75 of revenue in 2005 from 77 in 2004 this improvement primarily resulted from a 33 increase in platform pounds handled per hour fringe benefit costs increased to 290 of payroll from 273 in 2004 primarily due to increases in workers’ compensation expense recorded in the fourth quarter of 2005 we engaged an independent actuary to review our workers’ compensation and group health selfinsurance accruals in 2005 which resulted in 68 million of additional expense in our fringe benefit costs 

operating supplies and expenses increased to 149 of revenue in 2005 from 122 in 2004 this increase was primarily due to a 783 increase in diesel fuel costs excluding fuel taxes resulting from increased diesel fuel prices and a 224 increase in consumption we currently do not use diesel fuel hedging instruments therefore we are subject to market price fluctuations our fuel surcharges which are generally indexed to the us department of energy’s published fuel prices more than offset the increases in diesel fuel prices during 2005 

insurance and claims expense primarily consisting of premiums and selfinsured costs for auto liability and cargo claims decreased to 26 of revenue in 2005 compared to 32 in 2004 we choose to selfinsure a portion of our auto and cargo claims liabilities and obtain excess insurance coverage for claims above our retention levels the improvement in 2005 is primarily a result of a reduction in our auto liability expense in the fourth quarter of 2005 as a result of an independent actuarial review of our selfinsured reserve for unpaid claims cargo claims expense also decreased slightly in 2005 which we attribute to the increased utilization of adjustable rack systems and reusable inflatable air bags in our trailer fleet which protect freight from damage caused by load shifting new trailer purchases are equipped with these adjustable rack systems and we have retrofitted a portion of our existing trailer fleet 

the significant growth we experienced in 2005 required continued investment in real estate and equipment additionally we completed several expansion projects to existing service centers to ensure that our service center network is not a limiting factor to our growth as a result depreciation and amortization decreased only slightly to 53 of revenue in 2005 from 54 in 2004 in addition building and office equipment rents remained consistent at 09 of revenue for both 2005 and 2004 

we purchase transportation services from other motor carriers and railroads for linehaul and pd services we also contract with lease operators for our container operations and incur shortterm leases for tractors trailers and other revenue producing equipment we utilize these services when there are capacity restraints or imbalances of freight flow within our service center network or when it is economically beneficial purchased transportation decreased to 33 of revenue in 2005 from 36 in 2004 this decrease is primarily due to a decrease in the use of purchased linehaul services which is due to the increased use of our personnel and equipment 

  

our continued revenue growth and density improvements in 2005 allowed us to successfully leverage our communication and utilities costs along with general supplies and expenses which when combined decreased to 42 of revenue in 2005 from 47 in 2004 

interest expense net of interest income increased to 6527000 for 2005 from 5273000 for 2004 this increase is primarily due to an increased average balance of our longterm debt resulting from the two separate issuances of privatelyplaced senior notes under the note purchase agreement entered into on february 25 2005 

our effective tax rate for 2005 was 403 compared to 396 in 2004 the effective tax rate exceeded the federal statutory rate of 35 primarily due to the impact of state taxes and to a lesser extent certain nondeductible items 

liquidity and capital resources 

we have three primary sources of available liquidity to fund our estimated capital expenditures cash flows from operations shortterm investments and available borrowings under the fiveyear 225000000 senior unsecured revolving credit facility pursuant to the terms of an amended and restated credit agreement dated august 10 2006 with wachovia bank national association serving as the administrative agent for the lenders the “credit agreement” we also have the ability to issue senior notes to provide another source of liquidity if needed expansion in both the size and number of service center facilities our planned tractor and trailer replacement cycle and revenue growth have required continued investment in real estate and equipment in order to support these requirements we incurred net capital expenditures in 2006 of 208496000 including the capital assets obtained as part of the acquisition of business assets during 2006 cash flows from operations funded approximately 74 of these expenditures at december 31 2006 longterm debt including current maturities increased to 274582000 from 128956000 at december 31 2005 primarily due to the proceeds received from the privatelyplaced senior notes issued under the note purchase agreement entered into on april 25 2006 we entered into this note purchase agreement to refinance existing indebtedness and for general corporate purposes including but not limited to our estimated net capital expenditures not funded by operating cash flows the remaining net proceeds from this transaction are included in “shortterm investments” 

we estimate capital expenditures net of anticipated proceeds from dispositions to be approximately 245000000 to 255000000 for the year ending december 31 2007 of our gross capital expenditures approximately 100000000 is allocated for the purchase of tractors and trailers 126000000 is allocated for the purchase of service center facilities construction of new service center facilities or expansion of existing service center facilities and 15000000 is allocated for investments in technology the increase in our estimated capital expenditures for 2007 compared to 2006 is primarily due to planned real estate acquisitions and improvements to increase capacity at our existing service centers which we believe is necessary in order for us to achieve our growth objectives we plan to fund these capital expenditures primarily through cash flows from operations and the liquidation of our shortterm investments 

the table below sets forth our net capital expenditures for property and equipment including those obtained as part of the acquisition of business assets for the years ended december 31 2006 2005 and 2004 

 

   

the credit agreement as discussed above amended and restated the terms of the existing 110000000 senior unsecured revolving credit facility dated september 22 2005 as amended of the 225000000 line of credit commitments 150000000 may be used for letters of credit and 15000000 may be used for borrowings under wachovia’s sweep program the sweep program is a daily cash management tool that automatically initiates borrowings to cover overnight cash requirements up to an aggregate of 15000000 or initiates overnight investments for excess cash balances in addition we have the right to request an increase in the line of credit commitments up to a total of 300000000 in minimum increments of 25000000 at our option revolving loans under the facility bear interest at either a the higher of wachovia bank’s prime rate or the federal funds rate plus 05 per annum the “base rate” b libor one two three or six months plus an applicable margin the “adjusted libor rate” or c onemonth libor plus an applicable margin the “libor index rate” the applicable margin is determined by a pricing grid in the credit agreement and ranges from 05 to 1125 the applicable margin was 0625 for the period this credit agreement was in effect during 2006 revolving loans under the sweep program bear interest at the libor index rate 

the credit agreement contains customary covenants including financial covenants that require us to observe a maximum ratio of debt to total capital and a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio any future wholly owned subsidiaries of the company would be required to guarantee payment of all of our obligations under the facility at december 31 2006 there was no outstanding balance on the line of credit facility and there was 49117000 of outstanding letters of credit 

commitment fees ranging from 01 to 0225 are charged quarterly in arrears on the aggregate unutilized portion of the credit agreement letter of credit fees equal to the applicable margin for adjusted libor rate loans are charged quarterly in arrears on the daily average aggregate stated amount of all letters of credit outstanding during the quarter the commitment fees and letter of credit fees were 0125 and 0625 respectively for the period the credit agreement was in effect during 2006 in addition a facing fee at an annual rate of 0125 is charged quarterly in arrears on the daily average aggregate stated amount of all letters of credit outstanding during such quarter 

we have four unsecured senior note agreements outstanding totaling 273000000 at december 31 2006 these notes call for periodic principal payments with maturities ranging from 2008 to 2016 of which 11500000 is due in the next twelve months interest rates on these notes are fixed and range from 468 to 693 the effective average interest rate on our outstanding senior note agreements was 562 and 543 at december 31 2006 and 2005 respectively 

included in our senior notes is 175000000 of notes under a note purchase agreement entered into on april 25 2006 on april 25 2006 we issued 100000000 of privatelyplaced series a senior notes tranche a and on june 15 2006 issued an additional 75000000 of privatelyplaced series a senior notes tranche b collectively the “series a notes” pursuant to the terms of this note purchase agreement the series a notes are unsecured and bear an annual interest rate of 585 from the date of issuance and mature on april 25 2016 the series a notes call for semiannual interest payments beginning on october 25 2006 and seven equal annual principal prepayments commencing on april 25 2010 the proceeds from this agreement were used to refinance existing indebtedness under our revolving credit agreement and the company expects to use the remaining proceeds for planned capital expenditures and for general corporate purposes the note purchase agreement may also serve as the platform for potential future private note issuances by the company the aggregate principal amount of all notes issued pursuant to the note purchase agreement including the series a notes shall not exceed 500000000 the applicable interest rate and payment schedules for any new notes will be determined and mutually agreed upon at the time of issuance 

with the exception of borrowings pursuant to the credit agreement if any interest rates are fixed on all of our debt instruments therefore shortterm exposure to fluctuations in interest rates is limited to our line of credit facility we do not currently use interest rate derivative instruments to manage exposure to interest rate changes also we do not use fuel hedging instruments as our tariff provisions and contracts generally allow for fuel surcharges to be implemented in the event that fuel prices exceed stipulated levels 

  

our senior notes and credit agreement limit the amount of dividends that may be paid to shareholders pursuant to certain financial ratios our credit agreement which was the most restrictive at december 31 2006 limits the amount of dividends that could be paid to shareholders to the greater of i 10000000 ii the amount of dividends paid in the immediately preceding fiscal year or iii an amount equal to 25 of net income from the immediately preceding fiscal year we did not declare or pay a dividend on our common stock in 2006 or 2005 

a significant decrease in demand for our services could limit our ability to generate cash flow and affect profitability most of our debt agreements have covenants that require stated levels of financial performance which if not achieved could cause acceleration of the payment schedules we do not anticipate a significant decline in business levels or financial performance and we believe the combination of our existing credit agreement along with our additional borrowing capacity will be sufficient to meet seasonal and longterm capital needs 

the following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations as of december 31 2006 

 

  critical accounting policies 

in preparing our financial statements we apply the following critical accounting policies that we believe affect our judgments and estimates of amounts recorded in certain assets liabilities revenue and expenses these critical accounting policies are further described in note 1 of the notes to the financial statements included in item 8 of this report 

revenue recognition  we recognize revenue based upon when our transportation services have been completed in accordance with the bill of lading contract our general tariff provisions or contractual agreements with our customers generally this occurs when we complete the delivery of a shipment for transportation services not completed at the end of a reporting period we use a percentage of completion method to allocate the appropriate revenue to each separate reporting period under this method we develop a factor for each uncompleted shipment by dividing the actual number of days in transit at the end of a reporting period by that shipment’s standard delivery time schedule this factor is applied to the total revenue for that shipment and revenue is allocated between reporting periods accordingly 

allowances for uncollectible accounts and revenue adjustments  we maintain an allowance for uncollectible accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments we estimate this allowance by analyzing the aging of our customer receivables our historical loss experience and other trends and factors affecting the credit risk of our customers actual writeoffs could differ from our allowance estimate as a result of several factors including changes in the overall economic environment 

  

or factors and risks surrounding our customers additional allowances may be required if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments we continually review the underlying assumptions in our estimate of the allowance for uncollectible accounts so as to reflect the most recent trends and factors 

we also maintain an allowance for revenue adjustments resulting from billing corrections customer allowances moneyback service guarantees and other miscellaneous revenue adjustments these revenue adjustments are recorded in our revenue from operations we use historical experience trends and current information to update and evaluate these estimates 

management believes the methodologies for estimating these allowances to be reliable based on the accuracy of our estimates in prior periods as such we do not anticipate any nearterm changes in our methodologies for these estimates 

claims and insurance accruals  claims and insurance accruals reflect the estimated undiscounted cost of claims for cargo loss and damage bodily injury and property damage workers’ compensation longterm disability and group health not covered by insurance the related costs are charged to insurance and claims expense except for workers’ compensation longterm disability and group health which are charged to employee benefits expense 

insurers providing excess coverage above retention levels adjust their premiums to cover insured losses and for other market factors as a result we periodically evaluate our selfinsured retention levels to determine the most costefficient balance between selfinsurance and excess coverage 

in establishing accruals for claims and insurance expenses we evaluate and monitor each claim individually and we use factors such as historical claims development experience known trends and thirdparty estimates to determine the appropriate reserves for potential liability we believe the assumptions and methods used to estimate these liabilities are reasonable however changes in the severity of previouslyreported claims significant changes in the medical costs and legislative changes affecting the administration of our plans could significantly impact the determination of appropriate reserves in future periods 

property and equipment  property and equipment are recorded at cost and depreciated on a straightline basis over their estimated economic lives management uses historical experience certain assumptions and estimates in determining the economic life of each asset periodically we review property and equipment for impairment due to changes in operational and market conditions and we adjust the carrying value and economic life of any impaired asset as appropriate currently estimated economic lives for structures are 7 to 30 years revenue equipment is 4 to 12 years other equipment is 2 to 20 years and leasehold improvements are the lesser of the economic life of the leasehold improvement or the remaining life of the lease the use of different assumptions estimates or significant changes in the resale market for our equipment could result in material changes in the carrying value and related depreciation of our assets 

inflation 

most of our expenses are affected by inflation which generally results in increased operating costs in response to fluctuations in the cost of petroleum products particularly diesel fuel we have implemented a fuel surcharge in our tariffs and contractual agreements the fuel surcharge was implemented to offset the cost of diesel fuel above a base price and increases as diesel fuel prices escalate over the base which is generally indexed to the us department of energy’s published fuel prices for the past three years we do not believe that inflation has had a material effect on our results of operations

old dominion truck leasing inc “leasing” a north carolina corporation whose voting stock is owned by the earl e congdon intangibles trust david s congdon trustee the john r congdon revocable trust and members of earl e congdon’s and john r congdon’s families is engaged in the business of purchasing and leasing tractors trailers and other vehicles john r congdon is chairman of the board of leasing and earl e congdon is vice chairman of the board of leasing since 1986 we have combined our requirements with leasing for the purchase of tractors trailers equipment parts tires and fuel we believe that by combining our requirements we are often able to obtain pricing discounts because of the increased level of purchasing while this arrangement is beneficial to us we believe that the termination of this relationship would not have a material adverse impact on our financial results 

for the years ended december 31 2006 2005 and 2004 we charged leasing 3000 1000 and 7000 respectively for vehicle repair maintenance and other services we provide to leasing at cost plus a negotiated markup on march 15 2003 we entered into an agreement to sublease a vehicle maintenance facility in south bend indiana to leasing for which we charged 6000 in 2005 and 12000 in 2004 leasing terminated this rental agreement effective june 30 2005 in addition we charged leasing 12000 in 2004 for rental of a vehicle maintenance facility located in chesapeake virginia we terminated the rental agreement for this facility in the fourth quarter of 2004 without penalty due to our desire to utilize that property for other purposes 

we purchased 186000 237000 and 346000 of maintenance and other services from leasing in 2006 2005 and 2004 respectively we believe that the prices we pay for such services are lower than would be charged by unaffiliated third parties for the same quality of work and we intend to continue to purchase maintenance and other services from leasing provided that leasing’s prices continue to be favorable to us 

we also paid leasing 519000 33000 and 2000 for leased equipment in 2006 2005 and 2004 respectively the leased equipment was utilized by our customers who reimbursed us for the lease amount through a periodic billing process that included charges for additional services we provided to these customers we believe these leasing agreements are at arm’s length and we received no commission or other financial benefit from leasing or any other party in connection with these lease transactions 

split dollar life insurance policies 

we are the owner of two splitdollar life insurance contracts insuring the life of john r congdon the net cash surrender value for these policies was 2100000 and 1891000 at december 31 2006 and 2005 respectively and is included in our financial statements under the caption “other assets” these policies provided for an aggregate of 4448000 in net death benefits due to the company at december 31 2006 for which we have endorsed 2000000 to mr congdon’s spouse 

audit committee approval 

the audit committee of our board of directors reviewed and approved all of the related person transactions described above 

  




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact the consolidated financial position results of operations and cash flows due to adverse changes in financial market prices and rates 

we are exposed to interest rate risk directly related to loans under our senior unsecured revolving credit facility which have variable interest rates however the company utilized a portion of the proceeds from the 175000000 of fixedrate series a senior notes issued during the second quarter of 2006 pursuant to the terms of a note purchase agreement executed on april 25 2006 to refinance our outstanding loans under this credit facility the average principal balance and the effective annual interest rate under the credit facility for 2006 was 8588000 and 555 respectively a 100 basis point increase in the average interest rate on this agreement would have no material effect on our operating results we have established policies and procedures to manage exposure to market risks and use major institutions that are creditworthy to minimize credit risk 

we are exposed to market risk related to our shortterm investments however we invest in high quality investment grade securities with interest reset periods generally between 1 to 35 days a 100 basis point decrease in the average interest rate on our shortterm investments would have no material effect on our operating results 

we are also exposed to commodity price risk related to diesel fuel prices and have established policies and procedures to manage our exposure to that risk

 item 1 business 

  

unless the context requires otherwise references in this report to “old dominion” the “company” “we” “us” and “our” refer to old dominion freight line inc and its subsidiary on a consolidated basis 

  

general 

  

we are a leading lessthantruckload “ltl” multiregional motor carrier providing timely one to five day service among five regions in the united states and nextday and secondday service within these regions through our four branded product groups oddomestic odexpedited odglobal and odtechnology we offer an expanding array of innovative products and services at december 31 2004 we provided fullstate coverage to 29 of the 40 states that we served directly within the southeast south central northeast midwest and west regions of the country through marketing and carrier relationships we also provided service to and from the remaining states as well as international services around the globe we plan to continue to expand our markets and increase our direct coverage to 41 states and our fullstate coverage to 31 states in the first quarter of 2005 as a result of the january 2005 selected asset purchase of wichita southeast kansas transit “wskt” for a discussion of the wskt asset purchase see note 9 to the consolidated financial statements old dominion was founded in 1934 and incorporated in virginia in 1950 

  

we have grown substantially over the last several years through strategic acquisitions and internal growth prior to 1995 we provided interregional service to major metropolitan areas from and regional service within the southeast region of the united states since 1995 we have expanded our infrastructure to provide nextday and secondday service within four additional regions as well as expanded interregional service among those regions from 1995 through december 31 2004 we increased our number of service centers from 53 to 138 and our states directly served from 21 to 40 we believe that our present infrastructure will enable us to increase the volume of freight moving through our network or freight density and thereby improve our profitability 

  

we are committed to providing our customers with high quality service we are continually upgrading our technological capabilities to improve our customer service reduce our transit times and minimize our operating costs in addition to our core ltl services we provide premium expedited services container delivery service to and from nine port facilities and distribution services in which we either consolidate ltl shipments for full truckload transport by a truckload carrier or break down full truckload shipments from a truckload carrier into ltl shipments for our delivery 

  

we combine the rapid transit times of a regional carrier with the geographic coverage of an interregional carrier we believe our transit times are generally faster than those of our principal national competitors in part because of our more efficient service center network use of team drivers and investment in technology in addition our direct service to 40 states and five regions provides greater geographic coverage than most of our regional competitors we believe our diversified mix and scope of regional and interregional services enable us to provide our customers a single source to meet their ltl shipping needs 

  

we provide consistent customer service from a single organization offering our customers information and pricing from one point of contact many of our multiregional competitors that offer interregional service do so through independent companies with separate points of contact which can result in inconsistent service and pricing as well as poor shipment visibility our integrated structure allows us to offer our customers consistent and continuous service across all regions 

  

our industry 

  

trucks provide transportation services to virtually every industry operating in the united states and generally offer higher levels of reliability and faster transit times than other surface transportation options the trucking industry is comprised principally of two types of motor carriers truckload and ltl truckload carriers generally dedicate an entire trailer to one customer from origin to destination ltl carriers pick up multiple shipments from multiple customers on a single truck and then route the goods through service centers where freight may be transferred to other trucks with similar destinations for delivery 

  

in contrast to truckload carriers ltl carriers require expansive networks of local pickup and delivery service centers as well as larger hub facilities significant capital is required of ltl motor carriers to create and maintain a network of service centers and a fleet of tractors and trailers the substantial infrastructure spending needed for ltl carriers makes it difficult for new startup or small operations to effectively compete with established companies 

  

service center operations 

  

at december 31 2004 we conducted operations through 138 service center locations of which we own 68 and lease 70 we operate major breakbulk or hub facilities in atlanta georgia rialto california indianapolis indiana greensboro north carolina harrisburg pennsylvania memphis and morristown tennessee and dallas texas while using some smaller service centers for limited breakbulk activity in order to serve nextday markets our service centers are strategically located in five regions of the country to provide the highest quality service and minimize freight rehandling costs 

  

each of our service centers is responsible for the pickup and delivery of freight for its service area all inbound freight received by the service center in the evening or during the night is scheduled for local delivery the next business day unless a customer requests a different delivery schedule each service center loads the freight by destination the day it is picked up our management reviews the productivity and service performance of each service center on a daily basis in order to maximize quality service 

  

while we have established primary responsibility for customer service at the local service center level our customers may access information through several different gateways such as our website electronic data interchange automated voice response systems automated fax systems or through our customer service department located at our corporate office our systems offer direct access to information such as freight tracking shipping documents rate quotes rate databases and account activity 

  

we plan to expand capacity at existing service centers as well as expand the number of service centers geographically as opportunities arise that provide for profitable growth and fit the needs of our customers 

  

linehaul transportation 

  

our linehaul transportation department is responsible for directing the movement of freight among our service centers linehaul dispatchers control the movement of freight among service centers through realtime integrated freight movement systems we also utilize loadplanning software to optimize efficiencies in our linehaul operations our senior management continuously monitors freight movements transit times load factors and other productivity measurements to ensure that we maintain our highest levels of service and efficiency 

  

we use scheduled dispatches and additional dispatches as necessary to meet our published service standards in addition we lower our cost structure by maintaining flexible work force rules and by using twin 28foot trailers exclusively in our linehaul operations use of twin 28foot trailers permits us to pick up freight directly from its point of origin to destination with minimal unloading and reloading which also reduces cargo claims expenses and twin trailers permit more freight to be hauled behind a tractor than could be hauled if we used one larger trailer 

  

tractors trailers and maintenance 

  

at december 31 2004 we operated 3430 tractors we generally use new tractors in linehaul operations for approximately three to five years and then transfer those tractors to pickup and delivery operations for the remainder of their useful lives in a number of our service centers tractors perform pickup and delivery functions during the day and linehaul functions at night to maximize tractor utilization 

  

at december 31 2004 we operated a fleet of 13081 trailers as we have expanded and our needs for equipment have increased we have purchased new trailers as well as trailers meeting our specifications from other trucking companies these purchases of preowned equipment though providing an excellent value have the effect of increasing our trailer fleet’s average age 

  

the table below reflects as of december 31 2004 the average age of our tractors and trailers 

  

   

we develop certain specifications for tractors and trailers the production and purchase of which are negotiated with several manufacturers these purchases are planned well in advance of anticipated delivery dates in order to accommodate manufacturers’ production schedules we believe that there is sufficient capacity among suppliers to ensure an uninterrupted flow of equipment 

  

the table below sets forth our capital expenditures for tractors and trailers for the years ended december 31 2004 2003 and 2002 

  

   

at december 31 2004 we had major maintenance operations at our service centers in los angeles and rialto california atlanta georgia des plaines illinois indianapolis indiana jersey city new jersey greensboro north carolina columbus ohio harrisburg pennsylvania morristown and memphis tennessee and dallas texas in addition eleven other service center locations are equipped to perform routine and preventive maintenance checks and repairs on our equipment 

  

we have an established scheduled maintenance policy and procedure linehaul tractors are routed to appropriate maintenance facilities at designated mileage or time intervals depending upon how the equipment was utilized pickup and delivery tractors and trailers are scheduled for maintenance every 90 days 

  

marketing and customers 

  

at december 31 2004 we had a sales staff of 363 employees we compensate our sales force in part based upon revenue generated company and service center profitability and ontime service performance which we believe helps to motivate our employees 

  

we utilize a computerized freight costing model to determine the price level at which a particular shipment of freight will be profitable we can modify elements of this freight costing model as necessary to simulate the actual conditions under which the freight will be moved we also compete for business by participating in bid solicitations customers generally solicit bids for relatively large numbers of shipments for a period of one to two years and typically choose to enter into contractual arrangements with a limited number of motor carriers based upon price and service 

  

revenue is generated from many customers and locations across the united states and north america at yearend 2004 our customer base exceeded 60000 customers in 2004 our largest customer accounted for approximately 35 of revenue and our largest 20 10 and 5 customers accounted for approximately 224 151 and 103 of our revenue respectively for each of the previous three years less than 5 of our revenue was generated from international services we believe the diversity of our revenue base helps protect our business from adverse developments in a single geographic region and the reduction or loss of business from a single customer 

  

competition 

  

the transportation industry is highly competitive on the basis of both price and service we are the 7 th largest nonunionized ltl carrier in the united states measured by revenue we compete with regional interregional and national ltl carriers and to a lesser extent with truckload carriers small package carriers airfreight carriers and railroads competition is based primarily on personal relationships price and service we believe that we are able to compete effectively in our markets by providing high quality and timely service at competitive prices 

  

we believe our transit times are generally faster than those of our principal national competitors we believe this performance is due in part to our more efficient service center network use of team drivers and investment in technology in addition we provide greater geographic coverage than most of our regional competitors we believe our diversified mix and scope of regional and interregional services enable us to provide our customers with a single source to meet their ltl shipping needs and provides us with a distinct advantage over our regional multiregional and national competition 

  

we also believe our nonunion workforce gives us a significant advantage over our unionized ltl competition advantages of our workforce include flexible hours and the ability of our employees to perform multiple tasks which we believe result in greater productivity customer service efficiency and cost savings 

  

we compete with several larger transportation service providers each of which has more equipment a broader coverage network and a wider range of services than we do our larger competitors also have greater financial resources and in general the ability to reduce prices to gain business especially during times of reduced growth rates in the economy which may limit our ability to maintain or increase prices or maintain significant growth 

  

on february 25 2005 yellow roadway corporation announced that it entered into a definitive agreement to acquire usf corporation these two companies are direct competitors and the combined enterprise is expected to have annual revenue in excess of 9 billion the addition of usf corporation will allow yellow roadway to enter the nextday and regional markets which are among the fastest growing transportation markets and thereby may enable yellow roadway to compete more directly with us for customers 

  

seasonality 

  

our tonnage levels and revenue mix are subject to seasonal trends common in the motor carrier industry financial results in the first quarter are normally lower due to reduced shipments during the winter months harsh winter weather can also adversely impact our performance by reducing demand and increasing operating expenses freight volumes typically build to a peak in the third quarter and early fourth quarter which generally result in improved operating margins 

  

technology 

  

we continually upgrade our technological capabilities we provide access to our systems through multiple gateways that offer our customers maximum flexibility and immediate access to information we also employ freight handling systems and logistics technology in an effort to reduce costs and transit times our principal technologies include 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

insurance 

  

we carry significant insurance with third party insurance carriers and we selfinsure a portion of this risk we are currently selfinsured for bodily injury and property damage claims up to 2000000 per occurrence cargo claims are selfinsured up to 100000 we also are selfinsured for workers’ compensation in certain states and have first dollar or high deductible plans in the other states the workers’ compensation retention levels for all states range from 250000 to 1000000 depending on the plan year group health claims are selfinsured up to 300000 per occurrence and longterm disability claims are selfinsured to a maximum per individual of 3000 per month 

  

we believe that our policy of selfinsuring up to set limits together with our safety and loss prevention programs is an effective means of managing insurance costs we believe that our current insurance coverage is adequate to cover our liability risks 

  

fuel availability and cost 

  

our industry depends heavily upon the availability of diesel fuel in periods of significant price increases we have implemented a fuel surcharge to offset the additional cost of fuel which is consistent with our competitors’ practices however from time to time we experience shortages in the availability of fuel at certain locations and have been forced to incur additional expense to ensure adequate supply on a timely basis our management believes that our operations and financial condition are susceptible to the same fuel price increases or fuel shortages as those of our competitors fuel costs including fuel taxes averaged 95 of revenue in 2004 our current fuel surcharge program was implemented in august 1999 and has remained in effect since that time 

  

tire availability 

  

our industry depends heavily upon the availability of tires due to increased demand for tires in the transportation industry tire manufacturers have recently faced capacity constraints in response to these constraints we have obtained commitments from our suppliers to ensure that our needs for 2005 will be met 

  

employees 

  

as of december 31 2004 we employed 8497 individuals on a fulltime basis in the following categories 

  

   

as of december 31 2004 we employed 1981 linehaul drivers and 2355 pickup and delivery drivers all of our drivers are selected based upon driving records and experience drivers are required to pass drug tests and have a current united states department of transportation “dot” physical and a valid commercial driver’s license prior to employment drivers are also required to take drug and alcohol tests periodically by random selection 

  

to help fulfill driver needs we offer qualified employees the opportunity to become drivers through the “old dominion driver training program” since its inception in 1988 1609 individuals have graduated from this program from which we have experienced an annual turnover rate of approximately 9 we believe our driver training and qualification programs have been important factors in improving our safety record drivers with safe driving records are rewarded with bonuses of up to 1000 annually driver safety bonuses paid during 2004 were approximately 829000 

  

our management believes that relations with our employees are excellent and there are no employees represented under a collective bargaining agreement we believe our nonunion workforce gives us a significant advantage over unionized ltl carriers advantages of our workforce include flexible hours and the ability of our employees to perform multiple tasks which we believe result in greater productivity customer service efficiency and cost savings management’s focus on communication and the continued education development and motivation of our employees helps to ensure that our relationship with our employees remains excellent 

  

governmental regulation 

  

we are regulated by the surface transportation board an agency within the dot and by various state agencies these regulatory authorities have broad powers generally governing matters such as authority to engage in motor carrier operations hours of service certain mergers consolidations and acquisitions and periodic financial reporting the trucking industry is subject to regulatory and legislative changes such as increasingly stringent environmental and occupational safety and health regulations or limits on vehicle weight and size ergonomics and hours of service these changes may affect the economics of the industry by requiring changes in operating practices or by influencing the demand for and the costs of providing services to shippers 

  

the dot issued new hours of service regulations for the transportation industry that became effective january 2 2004 these new regulations increased the number of hours our drivers can drive from 10 hours to a maximum of 11 hours and defined the maximum number of hours in a workday to 14 hours measured from the driver’s initial start time these regulations also increased the minimum required number of hours of rest between work periods from 8 hours to 10 hours on september 30 2004 the us congress voted to extend the current hours of service regulations until no later than 

  

september 30 2005 after a july 2004 ruling by the us court of appeals for the district of columbia that vacated those rules in order to allow the dot adequate time to provide evidence that the new hours of service regulations are safe in response to the july 2004 us court of appeals decision the federal motor carrier safety administration “fmcsa” has been reviewing and reconsidering the hours of service regulations and has asked for public comments on february 9 2005 the fmcsa administrator announced that the bush administration will recommend to the us congress that it include the current hours of service regulations in this year’s highway reauthorization legislation 

  

we believe that the cost of compliance with applicable laws and regulations neither has materially affected nor will materially affect our results of operations or financial condition 

  

environmental regulation 

  

we are subject to various federal state and local environmental laws and regulations that focus on among other things the emission and discharge of hazardous materials into the environment or their presence on or in our properties and vehicles fuel storage tanks transportation of certain materials and the discharge or retention of storm water under specific environmental laws we could also be held responsible for any costs relating to contamination at our past or present facilities and at thirdparty waste disposal sites we do not believe that the cost of future compliance with environmental laws or regulations will have a material adverse effect on our operations financial condition competitive position or capital expenditures for the remainder of fiscal 2005 or fiscal 2006 

  

risk factors 

  

in addition to the factors discussed elsewhere in this report the following are some of the important factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those projected in any forwardlooking statements 

  

we operate in a highly competitive industry and our business will suffer if we are unable to adequately address potential downward pricing pressures and other factors that may adversely affect our operations and profitability 

  

numerous competitive factors could impair our ability to maintain our current profitability these factors include the following 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

if our employees were to unionize our operating costs would increase and our ability to compete would be substantially impaired 

  

none of our employees are currently represented by a collective bargaining agreement however from time to time there have been efforts to organize our employees at various service centers we can make no assurance that our employees will not unionize in the future which could in turn have a material adverse effect on our operating results because 

  

   

   

   

   

these results and unionization of our workforce generally could have a materially adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

  

if we are unable to successfully execute our growth strategy our business and future results of operations may suffer 

  

our growth strategy includes increasing the volume of freight moving through our existing service center network selectively expanding the geographic reach of our service center network and broadening the scope of our service offerings in connection with our growth strategy we have purchased additional equipment expanded and upgraded service centers hired additional personnel and increased our sales and marketing efforts and expect to continue to do so our growth strategy exposes us to a number of risks including the following 

  

   

   

   

   

we cannot assure that we will overcome the risks associated with our growth if we fail to overcome such risks we may not realize additional revenue or profits from our efforts we may incur additional expenses and therefore our financial position and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 

  

our information technology systems are subject to certain risks that we cannot control 

  

our information systems including our accounting systems are dependent upon thirdparty software global communications providers telephone systems and other aspects of technology and internet infrastructure that are susceptible to failure though we have implemented redundant systems and network security measures our information technology remains susceptible to outages computer viruses breakins and similar disruptions that may inhibit our ability to provide services to our customers and the ability of our customers to access our systems this may result in the loss of customers or a reduction in demand for our services 

  

we are exposed to potential risks from recent legislation requiring companies to evaluate their internal control over financial reporting 

  

management has concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of december 31 2004 in accordance with section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 based on management’s evaluation under the framework in internal control – integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission in addition our auditors have attested to management’s certification as set forth in its audit report included in this annual report management’s evaluation and our auditor’s attestation related to a software platform that we had used through december 31 2004 but that we had decided in 2003 to replace the process to convert our old software platform to our new platform occurred during 2004 and was completed on january 1 2005 consequently we must document and test and management must assess our internal control over financial reporting under the new software platform during 2005 and in future periods there can be no assurances that the evaluation required by sarbanesoxley section 404 in 2005 will not result in the identification of control deficiencies significant deficiencies or material weaknesses 

  

difficulty in attracting drivers could affect our profitability 

  

competition for drivers is intense within the trucking industry and we periodically experience difficulties in attracting and retaining qualified drivers our operations may be affected by a shortage of qualified drivers in the future which could cause us to temporarily underutilize our truck fleet face difficulty in meeting shipper demands and increase our compensation levels for drivers if we encounter difficulty in attracting or retaining qualified drivers our ability to service our customers and increase our revenue could be adversely affected 

  

insurance and claims expenses could significantly reduce our profitability 

  

we are exposed to claims related to cargo loss and damage property damage personal injury workers’ compensation longterm disability and group health we carry significant insurance with third party insurance carriers the cost of such insurance has risen significantly to offset in part the significant increases we have experienced we have elected to increase our selfinsured retention levels for most of our risk exposures if the number or severity of claims for which we are selfinsured increases or we are required to accrue or pay additional amounts because the claims prove to be more severe than our original assessment our operating results would be adversely affected insurance companies require us to obtain letters of credit to collateralize our selfinsured retention if these requirements increase our borrowing capacity could be adversely affected 

  

our business is subject to general economic factors that are largely out of our control 

  

economic conditions may adversely affect our customers’ business levels the amount of transportation services they need and their ability to pay for our services customers encountering adverse economic conditions represent a greater potential for bad debt losses which may require us to increase our reserve for baddebt in addition because we selfinsure a substantial portion of our group health expense increases in healthcare costs and pharmaceutical expenses can adversely affect our financial results our results also may be negatively affected by increases in interest rates which increase our borrowing costs and can negatively affect the level of economic activity by our customers and thus our freight volumes 

  

we have significant ongoing cash requirements that could limit our growth and affect our profitability if we are unable to obtain sufficient financing 

  

our business is highly capital intensive our net capital expenditures in 2004 and 2003 were 92106000 and 98441000 respectively we expect our capital expenditures for 2005 including the wskt selected asset purchase to be approximately 145000000 to 155000000 we depend on operating leases lines of credit secured equipment financing and cash flow from operations to finance the purchase of tractors trailers and service centers if we are unable in the future to raise sufficient capital or borrow sufficient funds to make these purchases we will be forced to limit our growth and operate our trucks for longer periods of time which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results 

  

in addition our business has significant operating cash requirements if our cash requirements are high or our cash flow from operations is low during particular periods we may need to seek additional financing which may be costly or difficult to obtain we currently maintain an 80000000 unsecured line of credit with lenders consisting of wachovia bank national association bank of america na and branch banking and trust company that will expire in june 2006 we also executed a note purchase agreement during the first quarter of 2005 pursuant to which we issued 50000000 of privatelyplaced senior notes in february 2005 and will issue an additional 25000000 of privatelyplaced senior notes in may 2005 for additional information on these senior notes see “liquidity and capital resources” included in item 7 

  

we may not realize additional revenues or profits from our infrastructure investments in a timely manner or at all 

  

we have invested and expect to continue to invest substantial amounts in building expanding and upgrading service center facilities if we are unsuccessful in our strategy for increasing our market share of ltl shipments we may not realize additional revenues or profits from our infrastructure investments in a timely manner or at all 

  

we may be adversely impacted by fluctuations in the price and availability of fuel 

  

fuel is a significant operating expense we do not hedge against the risk of fuel price increases any increase in fuel taxes or fuel prices or any change in federal or state regulations that results in such an increase to the extent not offset by freight rate increases or fuel surcharges to customers or any interruption in the supply of fuel could have a material adverse effect on our operating results historically we have been able to offset significant increases in fuel prices through fuel surcharges to our customers but we cannot be certain that we will be able to do so in the future from time to time we experience shortages in the availability of fuel at certain locations and have been forced to incur additional expense to ensure adequate supply on a timely basis 

  

limited supply and increased prices for new equipment may adversely affect our earnings and cash flow 

  

investment in new equipment is a significant part of our annual capital expenditures we may face difficulty in purchasing new equipment due to decreased supply the price of our equipment may be adversely affected in the future by regulations on newly manufactured tractors and diesel engines see the discussion below “we are subject to various environmental laws and regulations and costs of compliance with liabilities under or violations of existing or future environmental laws or regulations could adversely affect our business” 

  

we operate in a highly regulated industry and increased costs of compliance with or liability for violation of existing or future regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business 

  

we are regulated by the dot and by various state agencies these regulatory authorities have broad powers generally governing matters such as authority to engage in motor carrier operations safety and fitness of transportation equipment and drivers driver hours of service and periodic financial reporting in addition the trucking industry is subject to regulatory and legislative changes from a variety of other governmental authorities which address matters such as increasingly stringent environmental and occupational safety and health regulations or limits on vehicle weight and size and ergonomics regulatory requirements and changes in regulatory requirements may affect our business or the economics of the industry by requiring changes in operating practices or by influencing the demand for and the costs of providing transportation services 

  

we are subject to various environmental laws and regulations and costs of compliance with liabilities under or violations of existing or future environmental laws or regulations could adversely affect our business 

  

we are subject to various federal state and local environmental laws and regulations regulating among other things the emission and discharge of hazardous materials into the environment or presence on or in our properties and vehicles fuel storage tanks our transportation of certain materials and the discharge or retention of storm water under specific environmental laws we could also be held responsible for any costs relating to contamination at our past or present facilities and at thirdparty waste disposal sites environmental laws have become and are expected to become increasingly more stringent over time and there can be no assurance that our costs of complying with current or future environmental laws or liabilities arising under such laws will not have a material adverse effect on our business operations or financial condition 

  

the environmental protection agency has issued regulations that require progressive reductions in exhaust emissions from diesel engines through 2007 beginning in october 2002 new diesel engines were required to meet these new emission limits some of the regulations require subsequent reductions in the sulfur content of diesel fuel beginning in june 2006 and the introduction of emissions aftertreatment devices on newlymanufactured engines and vehicles beginning with model year 2007 these regulations could result in higher prices for tractors and diesel engines and increased fuel and maintenance costs these adverse effects combined with the uncertainty as to the reliability of the vehicles equipped with the newly designed diesel engines and the residual values that will be realized from the disposition of these vehicles could increase our costs or otherwise adversely affect our business or operations 

  

our results of operations may be affected by seasonal factors and harsh weather conditions 

  

our operations are subject to seasonal trends common in the trucking industry our operating results in the first quarter are normally lower due to reduced demand during the winter months harsh weather can also adversely affect our performance by reducing demand and reducing our ability to transport freight which could result in increased operating expenses 

  

if we are unable to retain our key employees our business financial condition and results of operations could be harmed 

  

the success of our business will continue to depend upon our executive officers the loss of the services of any of our key personnel could have a material adverse effect 

  

our principal shareholders control a large portion of our outstanding common stock 

  

on march 15 2005 earl e congdon and john r congdon and members of their families and their affiliates beneficially owned 325 of the outstanding shares of our common stock as long as the congdon family controls a large portion of our voting stock they will be able to significantly influence the election of the entire board of directors and the outcome of all matters involving a shareholder vote the congdon family’s interests may differ from other shareholders 

  

we cannot provide assurances that our acquisitions will be profitable or that they will not negatively impact our business 

  

acquisitions have been and continue to be an important part of our growth strategy however suitable acquisition candidates may not be available on terms and conditions we find acceptable in pursuing acquisitions we compete with other companies many of which have greater financial and other resources than we do to acquire attractive companies even if completed the following are some of the risks associated with acquisitions that could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

our business may be harmed by antiterrorism measures 

  

in the aftermath of the september 11 2001 terrorist attacks on the united states federal state and municipal authorities implemented various security measures including checkpoints and travel restrictions on large trucks if new security measures disrupt or impede the timing of our deliveries we may fail to meet the needs of our customers or may incur increased expenses to do so we cannot assure you that these measures will not have a material adverse effect on our operating results 

  

our stock price may be volatile and could decline substantially 

  

our common stock has experienced price and volume fluctuations many factors may cause the market price for our common stock to decline including some of the risks enumerated above in addition if our operating results fail to meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors in any quarter or securities analysts revise their estimates downward our stock price could decline 

  

in the past companies that have experienced volatility in the market price of their stock have been the subject of securities class action litigation if we become involved in a securities class action litigation in the future it could result in substantial costs and diversion of management attention and resources harming our business

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

  

overview 

  

we are a leading lessthantruckload multiregional motor carrier providing timely one to five day service among five regions in the united states and nextday and secondday service within these regions through our four branded product groups oddomestic odexpedited odglobal and odtechnology we offer an expanding array of innovative products and services at december 31 2004 we provided fullstate coverage to 29 of the 40 states that we serve directly within the southeast south central northeast midwest and west regions of the country through marketing and carrier relationships we also provided service to and from the remaining states as well as international services around the globe we plan to continue to expand our markets and increase our direct coverage to 41 states and our fullstate coverage to 31 states in the first quarter of 2005 as a result of the january 2005 acquisition of wskt 

  

historically over 90 of our revenue is derived from transporting ltl shipments for our customers whose demand for our services is generally tied to the overall health of the us domestic economy we combine the rapid transit times of a regional carrier with the geographic coverage of an interregional carrier we believe our transit times are generally faster than those of our principal national competitors and we are highly competitive with our principal regional competition 

  

in analyzing the components of our revenue we monitor changes and trends in the following key metrics 

  

   

   

   

   

our primary revenue focus is to increase shipment and tonnage growth within our existing infrastructure generally referred to as increased density thereby maximizing asset utilization and labor productivity we measure density over many different functional areas of our operations including revenue per service center linehaul load factor pickup and delivery “pd” stops per hour pd shipments per hour and platform pounds per hour we believe continued improvement in density is a key component in our ability to sustain profitable growth 

  

the majority of direct costs associated with our business are driver and service center wages and benefits operating supplies and expenses and depreciation of our equipment fleet and service center facilities we gauge our overall success in managing these costs by monitoring our operating ratio a measure of profitability calculated by dividing total operating expenses by revenue which also allows industrywide comparisons with our competition 

  

we continually upgrade our technological capabilities to improve our customer service and lower our operating costs this technology provides our customers with visibility of their shipments throughout our systems while providing key metrics from which we can monitor our processes 

  

we believe our nonunion workforce gives us a significant advantage over our unionized ltl competition advantages of our workforce include flexible hours and the ability of our employees to perform multiple tasks which we believe result in greater productivity customer service efficiency and cost savings we focus on communication and the continued education development and motivation of our employees to ensure that our relationships remain excellent 

  

market fluctuations in the cost of key components of our cost structure such as diesel fuel can affect our profitability our tariffs and contracts generally provide for a fuel surcharge as diesel fuel prices increase above stated levels we are also subject to market changes in insurance rates and we continue to evaluate our balance of excess insurance coverage and selfinsurance to minimize that cost 

  

results of operations 

  

the following table sets forth for the years indicated expenses and other items as a percentage of revenue from operations 

  

   

  

2004 compared to 2003 

  

key financial and operating metrics for 2004 and 2003 are presented below 

  

   

in 2004 and for the third consecutive year we achieved doubledigit growth in revenue net income and diluted earnings per share because our focus in 2004 remained primarily on revenue growth in existing markets we were successful in increasing our operating density and achieved reductions in our operating ratio to 914 from 923 in 2003 increased revenue and improved operating efficiency enabled us to achieve a 413 increase in net income and a 391 increase in earnings per share both in excess of our 234 growth in revenue our earnings per share improvement was achieved despite the dilutive effects of our third quarter 2004 stock offering which increased our shares outstanding by 736000 shares or 31 

  

our revenue growth in 2004 was driven primarily by two factors a 167 growth in ltl tonnage coupled with a 50 increase in ltl revenue per ltl hundredweight we believe our tonnage gains are due to overall improvements in the us domestic economy and our ability to attract new customers in 2004 ltl weight per ltl shipment increased 38 over 2003 we believe the increase in ltl weight per ltl shipment indicates greater demand for our customers’ products and a resulting increase in overall shipment size and weight in addition we have seen higher yearoveryear growth rates in our customer base that is priced through individual contracts revenue based on contractual pricing increased to 397 of our total revenue in 2004 compared with 377 in 2003 we believe the expansion of our service center network and fullstate coverage to 29 of those states at yearend 2004 has positioned us to be attractive to larger customers that ship to and from many regions in the country and seek to reduce their number of core carriers our contract customers generally offer larger shipments which increase our average ltl weight per ltl shipment these customers often have a greater length of haul which is consistent with our average length of haul increase to 937 miles in 2004 from 926 miles in 2003 

  

ltl revenue per ltl hundredweight increased to 1449 from 1380 our tariffs and contracts generally provide for a fuel surcharge as diesel fuel prices increase above stated levels this surcharge is recorded as additional revenue and is intended to offset significant fluctuations in the price of diesel fuel which is one of the larger components of our operating supplies and expenses because of average higher fuel prices in 2004 the fuel surcharge increased to 63 of revenue from 44 in 2003 excluding the fuel surcharge ltl revenue per ltl hundredweight increased 29 to 1357 from 1319 in 2003 reflecting our ability to marginally improve overall pricing in 2004 

  

during the year we opened 12 new service centers in addition to these openings we improved our direct service capabilities in canada and initiated sales operations in toronto and montreal while the expansion of our service center network and improvement in our service capabilities should provide a platform for future growth these events did not have a significant impact on our annual results 

  

density as measured by increases in tonnage and concentrations of shipments moving through our route structure and service center network generated efficiencies throughout our operations as a result we achieved reductions in salaries wages and benefits as a percentage of revenue which decreased to 569 in 2004 from 594 in 2003 

  

driver wages decreased to 229 of revenue in 2004 from 240 for the prior year we achieved a 20 improvement in pd shipments handled per hour and a 17 increase in our laden load average for the year we also experienced a similar reduction in platform labor which decreased to 77 of revenue in 2004 from 80 for the prior year our fringe benefit costs increased slightly to 273 of payroll in 2004 from 270 for the prior year due primarily to increases in holiday vacation and other paid time off 

  

operating supplies and expenses increased to 122 of revenue in 2004 from 108 in 2003 this increase was primarily due to a 561 increase in diesel fuel costs excluding fuel taxes resulting from increased fuel prices and an 185 increase in consumption we currently do not use diesel fuel hedging instruments therefore we are subject to market price fluctuations our fuel surcharges which decrease or are eliminated as fuel prices approach established base levels effectively offset the increases in diesel fuel prices in 2004 

  

insurance and claims expense primarily consisting of premiums and selfinsured costs for auto liability and cargo claims increased to 32 of revenue in 2004 compared to 26 in 2003 we choose to selfinsure a portion of our auto and cargo claims liabilities and obtain excess insurance coverage for claims above our retention levels while cargo claims liabilities in 2004 remained relatively constant with 2003 experience our auto liability claims experience under our retention level increased to 13 of revenue for 2004 compared to 07 in the prior year this increase is due to both the number and severity of claims that were incurred during 2004 and to increases in reserves for claims incurred in prior years 

  

the focus on revenue growth in existing markets has provided opportunities to leverage our investments in property and equipment as a result depreciation and amortization expenses decreased to 54 of revenue in 2004 from 57 in 2003 in addition building and office equipment rents decreased to 09 of revenue in 2004 from 11 in the prior year as a result of greater service center utilization and improved density our average revenue per service center increased 118 over the prior year 

  

we purchase transportation services from other motor carriers and railroads for linehaul and pickup and delivery services we also contract with lease operators and lease tractors trailers and other revenue producing equipment we utilize these services when there are capacity restraints or imbalances of freight flow within our service center network or when it is economically beneficial purchased transportation increased to 36 of revenue in 2004 from 32 in 2003 primarily as a result of the increased use of purchased linehaul services which increased to 10 of revenue in 2004 from 04 of revenue in 2003 we increased our utilization of these linehaul services in 2004 primarily to offset freight imbalances in our longer haul lanes 

  

our revenue growth and density improvements in 2004 allowed us to successfully leverage our communication and utilities costs along with general supplies and expenses which decreased to 47 of revenue in 2004 from 50 in 2003 

  

we applied the proceeds of 19753000 from our third quarter 2004 stock offering to reduce outstanding debt on our credit facility at yearend longterm debt including current maturities was 79454000 compared to 97426000 at december 31 2003 a decrease of 17972000 or 184 as a result interest expense for 2004 net of interest income decreased 137 to 5273000 from 6111000 in 2003 we also capitalized 154000 more interest during 2004 than the prior year which also contributed to the decrease in net interest expense 

  

our effective tax rate for 2004 was 396 compared to 391 in 2003 

  

2003 compared to 2002 

  

we produced a 178 increase in revenue in 2003 coupled with a 495 increase in net income for the year revenue increased to 667531000 from 566459000 in 2002 our second consecutive year of doubledigit revenue growth and the eleventh in the thirteen years since our initial public offering in 1991 our operating ratio decreased to 923 from 936 and net income for 2003 was 27600000 compared to 18462000 in 2002 

  

most of our growth in 2003 can be attributed to market share gains in existing areas of our operations which increased our density and resulted in lower incremental operating costs revenue per service center increased 137 despite opening 9 additional service centers in 2003 these openings accounted for less than 4 of our increase in revenue in 2003 but enabled us to offer fullstate coverage to all points in arkansas louisiana and missouri and increase our fullstate coverage from 24 to 27 of the 38 states in which we provide direct service 

  

our ltl shipments increased 129 over 2002 and ltl tonnage increased 121 both indicators of increased market share and an improving domestic economy we also continued to benefit from the september 2 2002 bankruptcy of consolidated freightways a major national ltl carrier and one of our competitors our average length of haul increased to 926 miles from 903 in 2002 which is consistent with the longer haul freight that became available after the closure of consolidated freightways 

  

ltl revenue per ltl shipment increased to 14257 from 13650 in 2002 an increase of 44 this was due to a combination of a 52 increase in ltl revenue per hundredweight partially offset by a 08 decrease in weight per shipment approximately 48 of our revenue was generated from public tariffs which are generally reviewed on an annual basis with the most recent general price increase occurring on july 3 2003 the remaining revenue base was generated from contractual agreements typically one to two years in length which are renegotiated as they near expiration while the average ltl weight per ltl shipment was lower in 2003 we have seen consecutive monthly increases in this measurement since april 2003 and we believe this is yet another indicator of an improving economic climate as our customers are moving larger shipments through our network 

  

our tariffs and contracts generally provide for a fuel surcharge as diesel fuel prices increase above stated levels this surcharge is recorded as additional revenue and is intended to offset significant fluctuations in the price of diesel fuel which is one of the larger components of our operating supplies and expenses because of average higher fuel prices in 2003 the fuel surcharge increased to 44 of revenue from 31 in 2002 

  

the market share increases we experienced in 2003 generated operating efficiencies and productivity gains throughout our operations which is reflected in a decrease in our operating ratio to 923 from 936 in 2002 the benefit of increased freight density was particularly evident in the reduction in salaries wages and benefits which decreased to 594 of revenue in 2003 from 602 in 2002 

  

pd wages decreased to 119 of revenue from 124 in 2002 a portion of these savings resulted from the rollout of our driver handheld computers which was completed by yearend 2003 these handheld computers provide direct communication between our drivers service center personnel and other old dominion systems which results in more efficient routings of our pd fleet and increased productivity for the comparable years pd shipments handled per hour increased 31 and pd wages per shipment decreased slightly despite an average hourly wage increase of approximately 25 

  

platform wages decreased to 80 of revenue in 2003 from 82 in 2002 this reduction was due to increased dock productivity partially due to the implementation of our dock yard management system at most of our major facilities by yearend 2003 this system utilizes barcode technology to improve freight visibility throughout our systems and allow for faster and more efficient handling of freight ltl weight per platform hour and ltl shipments per platform hour both measures of dock productivity increased 11 and 25 respectively in 2003 while platform wages per ltl hundredweight increased only 17 against an average hourly wage increase of 28 

  

reductions in pd and platform wages were partially offset by an increase in linehaul wages to 121 of revenue from 120 in 2002 linehaul miles increased 160 due to increased business levels and a longer average length of haul and average linehaul wages per mile increased 30 slight improvements in our linehaul load factor the weight of shipments loaded onto trailers for each linehaul dispatch was not sufficient to offset these additional costs 

  

our fringe benefit costs increased to 270 of payroll in 2003 from 265 for the prior year due primarily to increases in workers’ compensation expenses we selfinsure workers’ compensation claims in a range between 250000 and 1000000 depending upon the plan year and the state in which we are operating we also carry excess coverage for claims in excess of these deductibles in 2003 the combination of claims expense and insurance premiums was 39 of payroll compared to 32 in 2002 primarily due to anticipated settlement costs for our selfinsured portion 

  

diesel fuel costs excluding fuel taxes increased 417 over 2002 due to a 172 increase in consumption and increased costs per gallon we did not use diesel fuel hedging instruments in 2003 or 2002 therefore we were subject to market price fluctuations we believe that our fuel surcharges which decrease or are eliminated as fuel prices approach base levels effectively offset the increases in diesel fuel prices in 2003 

  

net capital expenditures in 2003 were 98441000 which included 45456000 for purchases of tractors and trailers in addition to 36111000 for purchases of service center facilities or capital improvements to existing service center facilities these capital expenditures included the purchase of eleven service center facilities auctioned as a result of the september 2002 bankruptcy of consolidated freightways as a result depreciation and amortization expenses increased to 57 of revenue from 55 in 2002 as these properties replaced leased facilities our building and office equipment rents decreased to 11 of revenue from 13 for the prior year 

  

insurance and claims expense primarily consisting of premiums and selfinsured costs for auto liability and cargo claims decreased to 26 of revenue in 2003 compared to 29 in 2002 premiums for excess coverage above our selfinsured retention levels generally increased over the prior year as a percentage of revenue these additional costs were offset by favorable claims experience in our selfinsured retention for both auto liability and cargo claims resulting in a decline in our overall insurance costs in 2003 

  

our revenue growth and density improvements in 2003 allowed us to successfully leverage other costs including communication and utilities general supplies and expenses and miscellaneous expenses which as a group declined to 55 of revenue from 65 in 2002 expenses for uncollectible revenue a component of miscellaneous expenses decreased to 01 of revenue from 07 in 2002 

  

interest expense for 2003 net of interest income increased 65 to 6111000 from 5736000 in 2002 by yearend we borrowed 14000000 on our line of credit and an additional 2650000 on other debt instruments however we made principal payments of 12447000 on outstanding debt during the year resulting in net borrowings of 4203000 for 2003 since average outstanding debt remained relatively constant for the comparable years the increase in interest expense can be attributed to the decrease in the amount of interest that was capitalized in 2003 which was 178000 compared to 699000 in 2002 

  

our effective tax rate for 2003 was 391 compared to 390 in 2002 

  

liquidity and capital resources 

  

expansion in both the size and number of service center facilities our planned tractor and trailer replacement cycle and revenue growth have required continued investment in real estate and equipment in order to support these requirements we incurred net capital expenditures of 92106000 during 2004 cash and cash flows generated internally funded approximately 98 of these expenditures at december 31 2004 longterm debt including current maturities decreased to 79454000 from 97426000 at december 31 2003 primarily due to the application of the proceeds from our third quarter 2004 stock offering to outstanding debt on our credit facility 

  

we estimate net capital expenditures including the wskt selected asset purchase to be approximately 145000000 to 155000000 for the year ending december 31 2005 of that approximately 102000000 is allocated for the purchase of tractors and trailers 27000000 is allocated for the purchase of service center facilities construction of new service center facilities or expansion of existing service center facilities 11000000 is allocated for investments in technology and the balance is allocated for other assets we plan to fund these capital expenditures primarily through cash flows from operations supplemented by additional borrowings 

  

  

the table below sets forth our net capital expenditures for the years ended december 31 2004 2003 and 2002 

  

   

we entered into an unsecured revolving credit agreement dated june 30 2003 with lenders consisting of wachovia bank national association bank of america na and branch banking and trust company with wachovia as agent for the lenders this threeyear facility as amended consists of 80000000 in line of credit commitments from the lenders all of which are available for revolving loans in addition of that 80000000 line of credit 40000000 may be used for letters of credit and 10000000 may be used for borrowings under wachovia’s sweep program the sweep program is a daily cash management tool that automatically initiates borrowings to cover overnight cash requirements up to an aggregate of 10000000 or initiates overnight investments for excess cash balances revolving loans under the facility bear interest at either a an applicable margin plus the higher of wachovia’s prime rate or onehalf of one percentage point over the federal funds rate the “adjusted base rate” or b libor plus an applicable margin the “adjusted libor rate” the applicable margin varies depending upon our ratio of adjusted debt to capital in the case of the adjusted base rate the applicable margin ranges from 0 to 025 in the case of the adjusted libor rate the applicable margin ranges from 075 to 125 the applicable margin under this agreement for 2004 for the adjusted base rate and the adjusted libor rate was 0 and 10 respectively revolving loans under the sweep program bear interest at the aggregate rate applicable under the sweep program plus the adjusted libor rate 

  

quarterly fees ranging from 020 to 030 are charged on the aggregate unused portion of the facility determined by our ratio of adjusted debt to capital the applicable rate for the periods under this agreement in 2004 was 025 quarterly fees are charged on the aggregate undrawn portion of outstanding letters of credit at a rate ranging from 075 to 125 which was 10 in 2004 as determined by our ratio of adjusted debt to capital in addition a quarterly facing fee at an annual rate of 0125 was charged on the aggregate undrawn portion of outstanding letters of credit 

  

the june 2003 credit facility contains customary covenants including financial covenants that require us to observe a maximum ratio of adjusted debt to capital to maintain a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio and to maintain a minimum consolidated tangible net worth our wholly owned subsidiary guaranteed payment of all of our obligations under the facility future wholly owned subsidiaries would be required to guarantee payment of all of our obligations under the facility at december 31 2004 there was 17333000 outstanding on the line of credit facility and there was 31047000 outstanding on the standby letter of credit facility 

  

we had three senior note agreements outstanding totaling 53714000 at december 31 2004 these notes call for periodic principal payments with maturities ranging from 2005 to 2008 of which 16607000 is due in 2005 interest rates on these notes are fixed and range from 635 to 759 

  

our senior notes and credit agreement limit the amount of dividends that may be paid to shareholders pursuant to certain financial ratios at december 31 2004 our credit agreement was the most restrictive and limited the amount of dividends that could be paid to shareholders to the difference between our current tangible net worth which is defined as shareholders’ equity plus intangible assets and the sum of 198000000 and 50 of cumulative net income since march 31 2003 we did not declare or pay a dividend on our common stock in 2004 and we have no plans to declare or pay a dividend in 2005 

  

we have a term loan with principal outstanding of 6636000 as of december 31 2004 which was used to purchase 300 tractors the term loan consists of 48month term notes secured by the purchased 

  

equipment pursuant to a security agreement with the lender the notes call for equal monthly payments of principal and interest and mature in 2006 of which 4141000 in principal is due within the next 12 months the interest rates on the notes are fixed and range from 421 to 439 the term loan agreement contains customary affirmative and negative covenants the term notes originally incorporated by reference the financial covenants from our may 2000 credit facility and were amended to incorporate by reference our financial covenants under our june 2003 facility 

  

with the exception of the line of credit interest rates are fixed on all of our debt instruments therefore shortterm exposure to fluctuations in interest rates is limited to our line of credit facility which had an outstanding balance of 17333000 at december 31 2004 we do not currently use interest rate derivative instruments to manage exposure to interest rate changes also we do not use fuel hedging instruments as our tariff provisions and contracts generally allow for fuel surcharges to be implemented in the event that fuel prices exceed stipulated levels 

  

a significant decrease in demand for our services could limit our ability to generate cash flow and affect profitability most of our debt agreements have covenants that require stated levels of financial performance which if not achieved could cause acceleration of the payment schedules we do not anticipate a significant decline in business levels or financial performance and we believe the combination of our existing credit facilities along with our additional borrowing capacity will be sufficient to meet seasonal and longterm capital needs 

  

on february 25 2005 we entered into a note purchase agreement with allstate life insurance company allstate life insurance company of new york new york life insurance company new york life insurance and annuity corporation united of omaha life insurance company pru  co as nominee for prudential retirement insurance and annuity company umbtru  co as nominee for security benefit life insurance company inc and metropolitan life insurance company under this agreement we issued 50000000 of privatelyplaced series a senior notes tranche a on february 25 2005 and will issue an additional 25000000 of privatelyplaced series a senior notes tranche b on may 25 2005 the “series a notes” the series a notes bear an interest rate of 468 and a maturity date of february 25 2015 the series a notes call for semiannual interest payments beginning on august 25 2005 and seven equal annual principal prepayments commencing on february 25 2009 the proceeds from this agreement were used to refinance existing indebtedness and for general corporate purposes the note purchase agreement may also serve as the platform for potential future private note issuances by the company the aggregate principal amount of all notes issued pursuant to the note purchase agreement including the series a notes shall not exceed 300000000 the applicable interest rate and payment schedules for any new notes will be determined and mutually agreed upon at the time of issuance 

  

pursuant to the february 25 2005 note purchase agreement our wholly owned subsidiary executed a subsidiary guaranty agreement dated as of february 25 2005 for the benefit of the note holders which provides that the subsidiary will absolutely unconditionally and irrevocably guarantee the full payment of all amounts due from the company and the performance of all of the company’s obligations agreements and covenants under the note purchase agreement as part of the financing we also entered into a second amendment dated as of february 25 2005 to our revolving credit agreement which amended the covenants contained in the credit agreement concerning debt limitations to permit the incurrence of debt under the series a notes 

  

  

the following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of december 31 2004 

  

   

     

critical accounting policies 

  

in preparing our consolidated financial statements we apply the following critical accounting policies that affect judgments and estimates of amounts recorded in certain assets liabilities revenue and expenses 

  

revenue and expense recognition  we recognize revenue based upon when our transportation services have been completed in accordance with the bill of lading contract our general tariff provisions or contractual agreements with our customers generally this occurs when we complete the delivery of a shipment for transportation services not completed at the end of a reporting period we use a percentage of completion method to allocate the appropriate revenue to each separate reporting period under this method we develop a factor for each uncompleted shipment by dividing the actual number of days in transit at the end of a reporting period by that shipment’s standard delivery time schedule this factor is applied to the total revenue for that shipment and revenue is allocated between reporting periods accordingly 

  

expenses are recognized when incurred 

  

allowance for uncollectible accounts  we maintain an allowance for uncollectible accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments additional allowances may be required 

  

claims and insurance accruals  claims and insurance accruals reflect the estimated unpaid cost of claims including amounts for claims incurred but not reported for cargo loss and damage bodily injury and property damage workers’ compensation longterm disability and group health not covered by insurance these costs are charged to insurance and claims expense except for workers’ compensation longterm disability and group health which are charged to employee benefits expense 

  

we are currently selfinsured for bodily injury and property damage claims up to 2000000 per occurrence cargo loss and damage claims are selfinsured up to 100000 we are selfinsured for workers’ compensation in certain states and have first dollar or high deductible plans in the remaining 

  

states with selfinsured retention levels ranging from 250000 to 1000000 group health claims are selfinsured up to 300000 per occurrence and longterm disability claims are selfinsured to a maximum per individual of 3000 per month 

  

insurers providing excess coverage above retention levels adjust their premiums to cover insured losses and for other market factors as a result we periodically evaluate our selfinsured retention levels to determine the most cost efficient balance of selfinsurance and excess coverage 

  

in establishing accruals for claims and insurance expenses we evaluate and monitor each claim individually and we use factors such as historical experience known trends and thirdparty estimates to determine the appropriate reserves for potential liability we believe the assumptions and methods used to estimate these liabilities are reasonable however changes in the severity of previously reported claims significant changes in the medical costs and legislative changes affecting the administration of our plans could significantly impact the determination of appropriate reserves in future periods 

  

goodwill  the excess cost over net assets acquired in connection with acquisitions or goodwill is recorded in “other assets” we completed the annual analysis of our intangible assets required by statement of financial accounting standard no 142 goodwill and other intangible assets “sfas 142” on our annual measurement date of october 1 2004 and determined that there was no impairment of intangible assets at december 31 2004 goodwill totaled 10648000 

  

property and equipment  property and equipment are recorded at cost and depreciated on a straightline basis over their estimated economic lives management uses historical experience certain assumptions and estimates in determining the economic life of each asset periodically we review property and equipment for impairment to include changes in operational and market conditions and we adjust the carrying value and economic life of any impaired asset as appropriate currently estimated economic lives for structures are 7 to 30 years revenue equipment is 4 to 12 years other equipment is 2 to 20 years and leasehold improvements are the lesser of the economic life of the leasehold improvement or the life of the lease the use of different assumptions estimates or significant changes in the resale market for our equipment could result in material changes in the carrying value of our assets 

  

inflation 

  

most of our expenses are affected by inflation which generally results in increased operating costs in response to fluctuations in the cost of petroleum products particularly diesel fuel we have implemented a fuel surcharge in our tariffs and contractual agreements the fuel surcharge is designed to offset the cost of fuel above a base price and increases as fuel prices escalate over the base for the past three years the net effect of inflation on our results of operations was minimal 

  

related party transactions 

  

family relationships 

  

each of earl e congdon john r congdon david s congdon john r congdon jr and john b yowell are related to one another and serves in various executive management positions andor on our board of directors in addition except for mr yowell each of them beneficially owns more than 5 of our common stock in 2004 we entered into employment agreements with earl e congdon john r congdon david s congdon and john b yowell which are filed as exhibits to our annual report on form 10k we regularly disclose the amount of compensation that we pay to these individuals in the proxy statement for our annual meeting of shareholders

for the years ended december 31 2004 2003 and 2002 we charged leasing 7000 39000 and 14000 respectively for vehicle repair maintenance and other services which we provide to leasing at cost plus a negotiated markup in addition we charged leasing 12000 annually in 2004 2003 and 2002 for rental of a vehicle maintenance facility located in chesapeake virginia on march 15 2003 we entered into an agreement to sublease a vehicle maintenance facility in south bend indiana to leasing for which we charged 12000 in 2004 and 10000 in 2003 

  

we purchased 346000 266000 and 297000 of maintenance and other services from leasing in 2004 2003 and 2002 respectively we believe that the prices we pay for such services are lower than would be charged by unaffiliated third parties for the same quality of work and we intend to continue to purchase maintenance and other services from leasing provided that leasing’s prices continue to be favorable to us we also paid leasing 2000 for leased equipment in 2004 but did not lease any equipment from leasing in 2003 or 2002

on july 29 2002 our board of directors also approved the leasing from ej of 150 pickup and delivery trailers on a monthtomonth basis for 204 per month for each trailer on december 1 2003 we purchased these 150 trailers for an aggregate purchase price of 907000 thereby ending all lease activity with ej 

  

there were no lease agreements in effect with ej during 2004 the total amount paid to ej for all trailers under lease was 357000 and 387000 for 2003 and 2002 respectively 

  

in december 1988 we sold ej certain tracts of unimproved land and a vacant service center facility in exchange for a receivable in the amount of 579798 in december 2003 ej paid the remaining receivable balance of 195677 which effectively ended this related party transaction

a control system no matter how well conceived and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the objectives of the control system are met further in designing a control system we must take into account the benefits of controls relative to their costs because of the inherent limitations in all control systems no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud if any within the company have been detected

old dominion freight line inc 

  

we have audited management’s assessment included in the accompanying management’s annual report on internal control over financial reporting that old dominion freight line inc maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2004 based on criteria established in internal control—integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission the coso criteria old dominion freight line’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting our responsibility is to express an opinion on management’s assessment and an opinion on the effectiveness of the company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit 

  

we conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board united states those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting evaluating management’s assessment testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances we believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion 

  

a company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles a company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 1 pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company 2 provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company and 3 provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements 

  

because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements also projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate 

  

in our opinion management’s assessment that old dominion freight line inc maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2004 is fairly stated in all material respects based on the coso criteria also in our opinion old dominion freight line inc maintained in all material respects effective internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2004 based on the coso criteria

 item 1 business tableend   

general 

  

we are a leading lessthantruckload “ltl” multiregional motor carrier providing timely one to five day service among five regions in the united states and nextday and secondday service within these regions through our four branded product groups oddomestic odexpedited odglobal and odtechnology we offer an expanding array of innovative products and services at yearend 2003 we provided fullstate coverage to 27 of the 38 states that we serve directly within the southeast south central northeast midwest and west regions of the country through marketing and carrier relationships we also provide service to and from the remaining 12 states as well as international services around the globe we plan to increase our direct coverage to 40 states and our fullstate coverage to 28 states in the first half of 2004 as we continue to expand our markets old dominion was founded in 1934 incorporated in virginia in 1950 and begins its seventieth year of operations in 2004 

  

we have grown substantially over the last several years through strategic acquisitions and internal growth prior to 1995 we provided interregional service to major metropolitan areas from and regional service within the southeast region of the united states since 1995 we have expanded our infrastructure to provide nextday and secondday service within four additional regions as well as expanded interregional service among those regions during this period we increased our number of service centers from 53 to 126 and our states directly served from 21 to 38 we believe that our present infrastructure will enable us to increase the volume of freight moving through our network or freight density and thereby improve our profitability 

  

we are committed to providing our customers with high quality service we are continually upgrading our technological capabilities to improve our customer service reduce our transit times and minimize our operating costs in addition to our core lessthantruckload or ltl services we provide premium expedited services including guaranteed ontime delivery timespecific delivery and airfreight services we also offer container delivery service to and from nine port facilities as well as assembly and distribution services in which we either consolidate ltl shipments for full truckload transport by a truckload carrier or break down full truckload shipments from a truckload carrier into ltl shipments for our delivery 

  

we combine the rapid transit times of a regional carrier with the geographic coverage of an interregional carrier we believe our transit times are generally faster than those of our principal national competitors in part because of our more efficient service center network use of team drivers and industry leading technology in addition our direct service to 38 states and five regions provides greater geographic coverage than most of our regional competitors we believe our diversified mix and scope of regional and interregional services enable us to provide our customers a single source to meet their ltl shipping needs 

  

we provide consistent customer service from a single organization offering our customers information and pricing from one point of contact most of our multiregional competitors that offer interregional service do so through independent companies with separate points of contact which can result in inconsistent service and pricing as well as poor shipment visibility our integrated structure allows us to offer our customers consistent and continuous service across all regions 

  

our industry 

  

trucks provide transportation services to virtually every industry operating in the united states and generally offer higher levels of reliability and faster transit times than other surface transportation options the trucking industry is comprised principally of two types of motor carriers truckload and ltl truckload carriers dedicate an entire trailer to one customer from origin to destination ltl carriers pick up multiple shipments from multiple customers on a single truck and then route the goods through terminals or service centers where freight may be transferred to other trucks with similar destinations for delivery 

  

in contrast to truckload carriers ltl carriers require expansive networks of local pickup and delivery service centers as well as larger hub facilities significant capital is required of ltl motor carriers to create and maintain a network of service centers and a fleet of tractors and trailers the substantial infrastructure spending needed for ltl carriers makes it difficult for new startup or small operations to effectively compete with established companies 

  

service center operations 

  

at december 31 2003 we conducted operations through 126 service center locations of which we own 57 and lease 69 we operate major breakbulk or hub facilities in atlanta georgia rialto california des plaines illinois indianapolis indiana greensboro north carolina harrisburg pennsylvania memphis tennessee morristown tennessee and dallas texas while using some smaller service centers for limited breakbulk activity in order to serve nextday markets our service centers are strategically located in five regions of the country to provide the highest quality service and minimize freight rehandling costs 

  

each of our service centers is responsible for the pickup and delivery of freight for its service area all inbound freight received by the service center in the evening or during the night is scheduled for local delivery the next business day unless a customer requests a different delivery schedule each service center loads the freight by destination the day it is picked up our management reviews the productivity and service performance of each service center on a daily basis in order to maximize quality service 

  

while we have established primary responsibility for customer service at the local service center level our customers may access information through several different gateways such as our website electronic data interchange automated voice response systems automated fax systems or through our customer service department located at our corporate office our systems offer direct access to information such as freight tracking shipping documents rate quotes rate databases and account activity 

  

we plan to expand capacity at existing service centers as well as expand the number of service centers geographically as opportunities arise that provide for profitable growth and fit the needs of our customers 

  

linehaul transportation 

  

our linehaul transportation department is responsible for directing the movement of freight among our service centers linehaul dispatchers control the movement of freight among service centers through realtime integrated freight movement systems we also utilize loadplanning software to optimize efficiencies in our linehaul operations our senior management continuously monitors freight movements transit times load factors and other productivity measurements to ensure that we maintain our highest levels of service and efficiency 

  

we use scheduled dispatches and additional dispatches as necessary to meet our published service standards in addition we lower our cost structure by maintaining flexible work force rules and by using twin 28foot trailers exclusively in our linehaul operations which also reduces cargo claims expenses use of twin 28foot trailers permits us to pick up freight directly from its point of origin to destination with minimal unloading and reloading and twin trailers permit more freight to be hauled behind a tractor than could be hauled if we used one larger trailer 

  

tractors trailers and maintenance 

  

at december 31 2003 we operated 3001 tractors we generally use new tractors in linehaul operations for approximately three to five years and then transfer those tractors to pickup and delivery operations for the remainder of their useful lives in a number of our service centers tractors perform pickup and delivery functions during the day and linehaul functions at night to maximize tractor utilization 

  

at december 31 2003 we operated a fleet of 11443 trailers as we have expanded and our needs for equipment have increased we have purchased new trailers as well as trailers meeting our specifications from other trucking companies that have ceased operations these purchases of preowned equipment though providing an excellent value have the effect of increasing the trailer fleet’s average age 

  

the table below reflects as of december 31 2003 the average age of our tractors and trailers 

  

   

we develop certain specifications for tractors and trailers the production and purchase of which are negotiated with several manufacturers these purchases are planned well in advance of anticipated delivery dates in order to accommodate manufacturers’ production schedules we believe that there is sufficient capacity among suppliers to ensure an uninterrupted flow of equipment 

  

the table below sets forth our capital expenditures for tractors and trailers excluding the acquisition of business assets in 2001 for the years ended december 31 2003 2002 and 2001 

  

   

we currently have major maintenance operations at our service centers in los angeles and rialto california atlanta georgia des plaines illinois indianapolis indiana jersey city new jersey greensboro north carolina columbus ohio harrisburg pennsylvania morristown and memphis tennessee and dallas texas in addition seven other service center locations are equipped to perform routine and preventive maintenance checks and repairs on our equipment 

  

we have an established scheduled maintenance policy and procedure linehaul tractors are routed to appropriate maintenance facilities at designated mileage or time intervals depending upon how the equipment was utilized pickup and delivery tractors and trailers are scheduled for maintenance every 90 days 

  

marketing and customers 

  

at december 31 2003 we had a sales staff of 326 employees we compensate our sales force in part based upon revenue generated company and service center profitability and ontime service performance which we believe helps to motivate our employees 

  

we utilize a computerized freight costing model to determine the price level at which a particular shipment of freight will be profitable we can modify elements of this freight costing model as necessary to simulate the actual conditions under which the freight will be moved we also compete for business by participating in bid solicitations customers generally solicit bids for relatively large numbers of shipments for a period of one to two years and typically choose to enter into a contractual arrangement with a limited number of motor carriers based upon price and service 

  

revenue is generated from many customers and locations across the united states and north america we currently serve over 55000 customers with 100 fullstate coverage in 27 of the 38 states that we offer direct service in addition through marketing and carrier relationships we provide service to the remaining 12 states as well as international services around the globe for the year ended december 31 2003 our largest customer accounted for approximately 21 of revenue and our largest 20 10 and 5 customers accounted for approximately 238 163 and 97 of our revenue respectively for each of the previous three years less than 5 of our revenue was generated from international services we believe the diversity of our revenue base helps protect our business from adverse developments in a single geographic region and the reduction or loss of business from a single customer 

  

competition 

  

the transportation industry is highly competitive on the basis of both price and service we compete with regional interregional and national ltl carriers and to a lesser extent with truckload carriers small package carriers airfreight carriers and railroads we believe that we are able to compete effectively in our markets by providing high quality and timely service at competitive prices 

  

seasonality 

  

our tonnage levels and revenue mix are subject to seasonal trends common in the motor carrier industry financial results in the first quarter are normally lower due to reduced shipments during the winter months harsh winter weather can also adversely impact our performance by reducing demand and increasing operating expenses freight volumes typically build to a peak in the third quarter and early fourth quarter which generally result in improved operating margins 

  

technology 

  

we continually upgrade our technological capabilities we provide access to our systems through multiple gateways that offer our customers maximum flexibility and immediate access to information we also employ freight handling systems and logistics technology in an effort to reduce costs and transit times our principal technologies include 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

insurance 

  

we carry significant insurance with third party insurance carriers and we selfinsure a portion of this risk we are selfinsured for bodily injury and property damage claims up to 1750000 per occurrence cargo claims are selfinsured up to 100000 we also are selfinsured for workers’ compensation in certain states and have first dollar or high deductible plans in the other states the workers’ compensation retention levels for all states range from 250000 to 1000000 depending on the plan year group health claims are selfinsured up to 250000 per occurrence and longterm disability claims are selfinsured to a maximum per individual of 3000 per month 

  

we believe that our policy of selfinsuring up to set limits together with our safety and loss prevention programs is an effective means of managing insurance costs we believe that our current insurance coverage is adequate to cover our liability risks 

  

fuel availability and cost 

  

our industry depends heavily upon the availability of diesel fuel we have not experienced difficulties in maintaining a consistent and ample supply of fuel in periods of significant price increases we have implemented a fuel surcharge to offset the additional cost of fuel which is consistent with our competitors’ practices however from time to time we experience shortages in the availability of fuel at certain locations and have been forced to incur additional expense to ensure adequate supply on a timely basis our management believes that our operations and financial condition are susceptible to the same fuel price increases or fuel shortages as those of our competitors fuel costs including fuel taxes averaged 82 of revenue in 2003 in response to fuel price fluctuations and to offset a portion of these additional costs we implemented a fuel surcharge program in august 1999 that has remained in effect since that time 

  

employees 

  

as of december 31 2003 we employed 7513 individuals on a fulltime basis in the following categories 

  

   

as of december 31 2003 we employed 1691 linehaul drivers and 2145 pickup and delivery drivers all of our drivers are selected based upon driving records and experience drivers are required to pass drug tests and have a current dot physical and a valid commercial driver’s license prior to employment drivers are also required to take drug and alcohol tests periodically by random selection 

  

to help fulfill driver needs we offer qualified employees the opportunity to become drivers through the “old dominion driver training program” since its inception in 1988 1396 individuals have graduated from this program from which we have experienced an annual turnover rate of approximately 9 in our management’s opinion our driver training and qualification programs have been important factors in 

  

improving our safety record drivers with safe driving records are rewarded with bonuses of up to 1000 annually driver safety bonuses paid during 2003 were approximately 756000 

  

our management believes that relations with our employees are excellent and there are no employees represented under a collective bargaining agreement we believe our nonunion workforce gives us a significant advantage over unionized ltl carriers advantages of our workforce include flexible hours and the ability of our employees to perform multiple tasks which we believe result in greater productivity customer service efficiency and cost savings management’s focus on communication and the continued education development and motivation of our employees ensures that our relationship with our employees remains excellent 

  

governmental regulation 

  

we are regulated by the surface transportation board an independent agency within the united states department of transportation and by various state agencies these regulatory authorities have broad powers generally governing matters such as authority to engage in motor carrier operations hours of service certain mergers consolidations and acquisitions and periodic financial reporting the trucking industry is subject to regulatory and legislative changes such as increasingly stringent environmental and occupational safety and health regulations or limits on vehicle weight and size ergonomics and hours of service these changes may affect the economics of the industry by requiring changes in operating practices or by influencing the demand for and the costs of providing services to shippers 

  

the us department of transportation issued new hours of service regulations for the transportation industry that became effective january 2 2004 these new rules increased the number of hours our drivers can drive from 10 hours to a maximum of 11 hours and defined the maximum number of hours in a workday to 14 hours measured from the driver’s initial start time these regulations also increased the minimum required number of hours of rest between work periods from 8 hours to 10 hours we believe this change will not have any material effect on our results of operations 

  

we believe that the cost of compliance with applicable laws and regulations neither has materially affected nor will materially affect our results of operations or financial condition 

  

environmental regulation 

  

we are subject to various federal state and local environmental laws and regulations that focus on among other things the emission and discharge of hazardous materials into the environment from our properties and vehicles fuel storage tanks and the discharge or retention of storm water under specific environmental laws we could also be held responsible for any costs relating to contamination at our past or present facilities and at thirdparty waste disposal sites we do not believe that the cost of future compliance with environmental laws or regulations will have a material adverse effect on our operations or financial condition 

  

risk factors 

  

in addition to the factors discussed elsewhere in this report the following are some of the important factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those projected in any forwardlooking statements 

  

we operate in a highly competitive industry and our business will suffer if we are unable to adequately address potential downward pricing pressures and other factors that may adversely affect our operations and profitability 

  

numerous competitive factors could impair our ability to maintain our current profitability these factors include the following 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

if our employees were to unionize our operating costs would increase 

  

none of our employees are currently represented by a collective bargaining agreement however from time to time there have been efforts to organize our employees at various service centers we have no assurance that our employees will not unionize in the future which could increase our operating costs and force us to alter our operating methods this could in turn have a material adverse effect on our operating results 

  

difficulty in attracting drivers could affect our profitability 

  

competition for drivers is intense within the trucking industry and we periodically experience difficulties in attracting and retaining qualified drivers our operations may be affected by a shortage of qualified drivers in the future which could cause us to temporarily underutilize our truck fleet face difficulty in meeting shipper demands and increase our compensation levels for drivers if we encounter difficulty in attracting or retaining qualified drivers our ability to service our customers and increase our revenue could be adversely affected 

  

insurance and claims expenses could significantly reduce our profitability 

  

we are exposed to claims related to cargo loss and damage property damage personal injury workers’ compensation longterm disability and group health we carry significant insurance with third party insurance carriers the cost of such insurance has risen significantly to offset in part the significant increases we have experienced we have elected to increase our selfinsured retention levels for most of our risk exposures if the number or severity of claims for which we are selfinsured increases our operating results would be adversely affected insurance companies require us to obtain letters of credit to collateralize our selfinsured retention if these requirements increase our borrowing capacity could be adversely affected 

  

our business is subject to general economic factors that are largely out of our control 

  

economic conditions may adversely affect our customers’ business levels the amount of transportation services they need and their ability to pay for our services customers encountering adverse economic conditions represent a greater potential for loss and we may be required to increase our reserve for baddebt losses 

  

we have significant ongoing cash requirements that could limit our growth and affect our profitability if we are unable to obtain sufficient financing 

  

our business is highly capital intensive our net capital expenditures in 2003 and 2002 were 98441000 and 69105000 respectively we expect our capital expenditures for 2004 to be approximately 70000000 to 80000000 we depend on operating leases lines of credit secured equipment financing and cash flow from operations to finance the purchase of tractors trailers and service centers if we are unable in the future to raise sufficient capital or borrow sufficient funds to make these purchases we will be forced to limit our growth and operate our trucks for longer periods of time which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results 

  

in addition our business has significant operating cash requirements if our cash requirements are high or our cash flow from operations is low during particular periods we may need to seek additional financing which may be costly or difficult to obtain we currently maintain an 80000000 unsecured line of credit with lenders consisting of wachovia bank na bank of america na and branch banking and trust company that will expire in june 2006 

  

we may not realize additional revenues or profits from our infrastructure investments in a timely manner or at all 

  

we have invested and expect to continue to invest substantial amounts in building expanding and upgrading service center facilities if we are unsuccessful in our strategy for increasing our market share of ltl shipments we may not realize additional revenues or profits from our infrastructure investments in a timely manner or at all 

  

we may be adversely impacted by fluctuations in the price and availability of fuel 

  

fuel is a significant operating expense we do not hedge against the risk of fuel price increases any increase in fuel taxes or fuel prices or any change in federal or state regulations that results in such an increase to the extent not offset by freight rate increases or fuel surcharges to customers or any interruption in the supply of fuel could have a material adverse effect on our operating results historically we have been able to offset significant increases in fuel prices through fuel surcharges to our customers but we cannot be certain that we will be able to do so in the future from time to time we experience shortages in the availability of fuel at certain locations and have been forced to incur additional expense to ensure adequate supply on a timely basis 

  

limited supply and increased prices for new equipment may adversely affect our earnings and cash flow 

  

investment in new equipment is a significant part of our annual capital expenditures we may face difficulty in purchasing new equipment due to decreased supply the price of our equipment may be adversely affected in the future by regulations on newly manufactured tractors and diesel engines see the discussion below “we are subject to various environmental laws and regulations and costs of compliance with liabilities under or violations of existing or future environmental laws or regulations could adversely affect our business” 

  

we operate in a highly regulated industry and increased costs of compliance with or liability for violation of existing or future regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business 

  

we are regulated by the surface transportation board an independent agency within the united states department of transportation and by various state agencies these regulatory authorities have broad powers generally governing matters such as authority to engage in motor carrier operations hours of service certain mergers consolidations and acquisitions and periodic financial reporting the trucking industry is subject to regulatory and legislative changes such as increasingly stringent environmental and occupational safety and health regulations or limits on vehicle weight and size ergonomics and hours of service these changes may affect the economics of the industry by requiring changes in operating practices or by influencing the demand for and the costs of providing services to shippers 

  

we are subject to various environmental laws and regulations and costs of compliance with liabilities under or violations of existing or future environmental laws or regulations could adversely affect our business 

  

we are subject to various federal state and local environmental laws and regulations regulating among other things the emission and discharge of hazardous materials into the environment from our properties and vehicles fuel storage tanks and the discharge or retention of storm water under specific environmental laws we could also be held responsible for any costs relating to contamination at our past or present facilities and at thirdparty waste disposal sites environmental laws have become and are expected to become increasingly more stringent over time and there can be no assurance that our costs of complying with current or future environmental laws or liabilities arising under such laws will not have a material adverse effect on our business operations or financial condition 

  

the environmental protection agency has issued regulations that require progressive reductions in exhaust emissions from diesel engines through 2007 beginning in october 2002 new diesel engines were required to meet these new emission limits some of the regulations require subsequent reductions in the sulfur content of diesel fuel beginning in june 2006 and the introduction of emissions aftertreatment devices on newlymanufactured engines and vehicles beginning with model year 2007 these regulations could result in higher prices for tractors and diesel engines and increased fuel and maintenance costs these adverse effects combined with the uncertainty as to the reliability of the vehicles equipped with the newly designed diesel engines and the residual values that will be realized from the disposition of these vehicles could increase our costs or otherwise adversely affect our business or operations 

  

our results of operations may be affected by seasonal factors and harsh weather conditions 

  

our operations are subject to seasonal trends common in the trucking industry our operating results in the first quarter are normally lower due to reduced demand during the winter months harsh weather can also adversely affect our performance by reducing demand and our ability to transport freight and increasing operating expenses 

  

if we are unable to retain our key employees our business financial condition and results of operations could be harmed 

  

the success of our business will continue to depend upon our executive officers and we do not have employment agreements with any of them the loss of the services of any of our key personnel could have a material adverse effect on us 

  

our principal shareholders control a large portion of our outstanding common stock 

  

on march 9 2004 earl e congdon and john r congdon and members of their families and their affiliates beneficially owned 421 of the outstanding shares of our common stock as long as the congdon family controls a large portion of our voting stock they will be able to significantly influence the election of the entire board of directors and the outcome of all matters involving a shareholder vote the congdon family’s interests may differ from yours 

  

we may not be able to continue to successfully execute our acquisition strategy which could cause our business and future growth prospects to suffer 

  

acquisitions have been and continue to be an important part of our growth strategy however suitable acquisition candidates may not be available on terms and conditions we find acceptable in pursuing acquisitions we compete with other companies many of which have greater financial and other resources than we do to acquire attractive companies even if completed the following are some of the risks associated with acquisitions that could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

our business may be harmed by antiterrorism measures 

  

in the aftermath of the september 11 2001 terrorist attacks on the united states federal state and municipal authorities have implemented and are continuing to implement various security measures including checkpoints and travel restrictions on large trucks if new security measures disrupt or impede the timing of our deliveries we may fail to meet the needs of our customers or may incur increased expenses to do so we cannot assure you that these measures will not have a material adverse effect on our operating results 

  

our stock price may be volatile and could decline substantially 

  

our common stock has experienced price and volume fluctuations many factors may cause the market price for our common stock to decline including some of the risks enumerated above in addition if our operating results fail to meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors in any quarter or securities analysts revise their estimates downward our stock price could decline 

  

in the past companies that have experienced volatility in the market price of their stock have been the subject of securities class action litigation if we become involved in a securities class action litigation in the future it could result in substantial costs and diversion of management attention and resources harming our business

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations tableend   

overview 

  

we are a leading lessthantruckload multiregional motor carrier providing timely one to five day service among five regions in the united states and nextday and secondday service within these regions through our four branded product groups oddomestic odexpedited odglobal and odtechnology we offer an expanding array of innovative products and services at yearend 2003 we provided fullstate coverage to 27 of the 38 states that we serve directly within the southeast south central northeast midwest and west regions of the country through marketing and carrier relationships we also provide service to and from the remaining 12 states as well as international services around the globe we plan to increase our direct coverage to 40 states and our fullstate coverage to 28 states in the first half of 2004 as we continue to expand our markets 

  

historically over 90 of our revenue is derived from transporting ltl shipments for our customers whose demand for our services is generally tied to the overall health of the us domestic economy we combine the rapid transit times of a regional carrier with the geographic coverage of an interregional carrier we believe our transit times are generally faster than those of our principal national competitors and we are highly competitive with our principal regional competition 

  

in analyzing the components of our revenue we monitor changes and trends in the following key metrics 

  

   

   

   

   

our primary revenue focus is to increase shipment and tonnage growth within our existing infrastructure generally referred to as increased density thereby maximizing asset utilization and labor productivity we measure density over many different functional areas of our operations including revenue per service center linehaul load factor pickup and delivery “pd” stops per hour pd shipments per hour and platform pounds per hour we believe continued improvement in density is a key component in our ability to sustain profitable growth 

  

the majority of direct costs associated with our business are driver and service center wages and benefits operating supplies and expenses and depreciation of our equipment fleet and service center facilities we gauge our overall success in managing these costs by monitoring our operating ratio a measure of profitability calculated by dividing total operating expenses by revenue which also allows industry wide comparisons with our competition 

  

we continually upgrade our technological capabilities to improve our customer service and lower our operating costs this technology provides our customers with visibility of their shipments throughout our systems while providing key metrics from which we can monitor our processes 

  

we believe our nonunion workforce gives us a significant advantage over our unionized ltl competition advantages of our workforce include flexible hours and the ability of our employees to perform multiple tasks which we believe result in greater productivity customer service efficiency and cost savings we focus on communication and the continued education development and motivation of our employees to ensure that our relationships remain excellent 

  

market fluctuations in the cost of key components of our cost structure such as diesel fuel affect our profitability our tariffs and contracts generally provide for a fuel surcharge as diesel fuel prices increase above stated levels we are also subject to market changes in insurance rates and we continue to evaluate our balance of excess insurance coverage and selfinsurance to minimize that cost 

  

results of operations 

  

the following table sets forth for the years indicated expenses and other items as a percentage of revenue from operations 

  

   

2003 compared to 2002 

  

we produced a 178 increase in revenue in 2003 coupled with a 495 increase in net income for the year revenue increased to 667531000 from 566459000 in 2002 our second consecutive year of doubledigit revenue growth and the eleventh in the thirteen years since our initial public offering in 1991 our operating ratio decreased to 923 from 936 and net income for 2003 was 27600000 compared to 18462000 in 2002 

  

most of our growth in 2003 can be attributed to market share gains in existing areas of our operations which increased our density and resulted in lower incremental operating costs revenue per service center increased 137 despite opening 9 additional service centers in 2003 these openings accounted for less that 4 of our increase in revenue in 2003 but enabled us to offer fullstate coverage to all points in arkansas louisiana and missouri and increase our fullstate coverage from 24 to 27 of the 38 states in which we provide direct service 

  

our ltl shipments increased 129 over 2002 and ltl tonnage increased 121 both indicators of increased market share and an improving domestic economy we also continued to benefit from the september 2 2002 bankruptcy of consolidated freightways a major national ltl carrier and one of our competitors our average length of haul increased to 926 miles from 903 in 2002 which is consistent with the longer haul freight that became available after the closure of consolidated freightways 

  

ltl revenue per ltl shipment increased to 14859 from 14104 in 2002 an increase of 54 this was due to a combination of a 61 increase in ltl revenue per hundredweight partially offset by a 8 decrease in weight per shipment approximately 48 of our revenue is generated from public tariffs which are generally reviewed on an annual basis with the most recent general price increase occurring on july 3 2003 the remaining revenue base is generated from contractual agreements typically one to two years in length which are renegotiated as they near expiration while the average ltl weight per ltl shipment was lower in 2003 we have seen consecutive monthly increases in this measurement since april 2003 and we believe this is yet another indicator of an improving economic climate as our customers are moving larger shipments through our network 

  

our tariffs and contracts generally provide for a fuel surcharge as diesel fuel prices increase above stated levels this surcharge is recorded as additional revenue and is intended to offset significant fluctuations in the price of diesel fuel which is one of the larger components of our operating supplies and expenses because of average higher fuel prices in 2003 the fuel surcharge increased to 44 of revenue from 31 in 2002 

  

the market share increases we experienced in 2003 generated operating efficiencies and productivity gains throughout our operations which is reflected in a decrease in our operating ratio to 923 from 936 in 2002 the benefits of increased freight density was particularly evident in the reduction in salaries wages and benefits which decreased to 594 of revenue in 2003 from 602 in 2002 

  

pd wages decreased to 119 of revenue from 124 in 2002 a portion of these savings resulted from the rollout of our driver handheld computers which was completed by yearend 2003 these handheld computers provide direct communication between our drivers service center personnel and other old dominion systems which results in more efficient routings of our pd fleet and increased productivity for the comparable years pd shipments handled per hour increased 31 and pd wages per shipment decreased slightly despite an average hourly wage increase of approximately 25 

  

platform wages decreased to 80 of revenue in 2003 from 82 for the prior year this reduction was due to increased dock productivity partially due to the implementation of our dock yard management system at most of our major facilities by yearend 2003 this system utilizes barcode technology to improve freight visibility throughout our systems and allow for faster and more efficient handling of freight ltl weight per platform hour and ltl shipments per platform hour both measures of dock productivity increased 11 and 25 respectively in 2003 while platform wages per ltl hundredweight increased only 17 against an average hourly wage increase of 28 

  

reductions in pd and platform wages were partially offset by an increase in linehaul wages to 121 of revenue from 120 in 2002 linehaul miles increased 160 due to increased business levels and a longer average length of haul and average linehaul wages per mile increased 30 slight improvements in our linehaul load factor the weight of shipments loaded onto trailers for each linehaul dispatch was not sufficient to offset these additional costs 

  

our fringe benefit costs increased to 270 of payroll in 2003 from 265 for the prior year due primarily to increases in workers’ compensation expenses we selfinsure workers’ compensation claims in a range between 250000 and 1000000 depending upon the plan year and the state in which we are operating we also carry excess coverage for claims in excess of these deductibles in 2003 the combination of claims expense and insurance premiums was 39 of payroll compared to 32 in 2002 primarily due to anticipated settlement costs for our selfinsured portion 

  

diesel fuel costs excluding fuel taxes increased 417 over 2003 due to a 172 increase in consumption and increased costs per gallon we currently do not use diesel fuel hedging instruments therefore we are subject to market price fluctuations we believe that our fuel surcharges which decrease or are eliminated as fuel prices approach base levels have effectively offset the increases in diesel fuel prices in 2003 

  

net capital expenditures in 2003 were 98441000 which included 45456000 for purchases of tractors and trailers in addition to 36111000 for purchases of service center facilities or capital improvements to existing service center facilities these capital expenditures included the purchase of eleven service center facilities auctioned as a result of the september 2002 bankruptcy of consolidated freightways as a result depreciation and amortization expenses increased to 57 of revenue from 55 in 2002 as these properties replaced leased facilities our building and office equipment rents decreased to 11 of revenue from 13 for the prior year 

  

insurance and claims expense primarily consisting of premiums and selfinsured costs for auto liability and cargo claims decreased to 26 of revenue in 2003 compared to 29 in 2002 premiums for excess coverage above our selfinsured retention levels generally increased over the prior year as a percentage of revenue these additional costs were offset by favorable claims experience in our selfinsured retention for both auto liability and cargo claims resulting in a decline in our overall insurance costs in 2003 

  

our revenue growth and density improvements in 2003 allowed us to successfully leverage other costs including communication and utilities general supplies and expenses and miscellaneous expenses which as a group declined to 55 of revenue from 65 in 2002 expenses for uncollectible revenue a component of miscellaneous expenses decreased to 1 of revenue from 7 in 2002 

  

interest expense for 2003 net of interest income increased 65 to 6111000 from 5736000 in 2002 by yearend we borrowed 14000000 on our line of credit and an additional 2650000 on other debt instruments however we made principal payments of 12447000 on outstanding debt during the year resulting in net borrowings of 4203000 for 2003 since average outstanding debt remained relatively constant for the comparable years the increase in interest expense can be attributed to the decrease in the amount of interest that was capitalized in 2003 which was 178000 compared to 699000 in 2002 

  

our effective tax rate for 2003 was 391 compared to 390 in 2002 

  

2002 compared to 2001 

  

in 2002 we achieved doubledigit revenue growth improved our operating efficiencies and increased our earnings at a faster rate than revenue growth we achieved these objectives even while the us economy remained sluggish throughout the year primarily by implementing our strategy of growing revenue in our existing areas of operation and improving asset utilization revenue for 2002 increased 128 to 566459000 compared to 502239000 in 2001 our operating ratio improved to 936 from 951 and net income improved to 18462000 for 2002 or 551 over net income for 2001 of 11905000 

  

our revenue growth strategy was based upon increasing market share through improved service products faster transit times and expanded coverage consistent with these objectives we announced fullstate coverage for the state of new hampshire in june 2002 which increased the number of states that we provided 100 coverage to 24 while expansion plans are closely tied to the strength of the national economy we seek to produce longterm profitable growth by positioning ourselves to expand significantly in stronger economic times and avoiding the risk of overextending ourselves in weaker economic cycles 

  

revenue growth in 2002 was driven by an 118 increase in the number of shipments handled coupled with a 9 increase in revenue per shipment the improvement in revenue per shipment resulted from a 22 increase in revenue per hundredweight partially offset by a 13 decrease in weight per shipment the improvement in revenue per hundredweight in 2002 was due more to a 30 increase in our average length of haul than to our ability to raise rates or maintain pricing particularly in the first half of the year our average length of haul increased to 903 miles in 2002 from 877 miles in 2001 

  

a portion of our revenue growth in the second half of the year can be attributed to the increase in freight volume associated with the september 3 2002 bankruptcy of consolidated freightways a major national ltl carrier with annual revenues of 23 billion in 2001 and one of our competitors while we experienced a 77 increase in shipments and a 4 decrease in revenue per shipment in the first half of the year we gained a significant amount of momentum in the second half of the year as reflected by a 159 increase in shipments and a 20 improvement in revenue per shipment 

  

we also benefited from a full year of revenue and increased market share generated by the 13 additional service centers we opened in our south central area on february 10 2001 when we acquired certain assets of carter  sons freightways of carrollton texas 

  

as a result of our market share improvements throughout our service center network tonnage increased 103 in 2002 over 2001 enabling us to obtain certain economies of scale as we moved greater concentrations of shipments through our existing route structure and service center network as a result our incremental costs associated with this added volume were generally lower as reflected by the improvement in our operating ratio 

  

salaries wages and employee benefit expenses the largest component of our cost structure were 602 of revenue in 2002 compared to 610 in 2001 most of these costs were incurred as variable driver and platform labor directly associated with the movement of shipments through our network our driver and platform wages excluding benefit expenses were 326 of revenue in 2002 compared to 330 for 2001 

  

the cost of providing group health benefits to our employees and their families decreased to 37 of revenue in 2002 from 43 in 2001 after experiencing a 245 increase in these costs in 2001 primarily due to significant increases in the cost of our prescription drug benefit we identified cost savings opportunities that were implemented in january 2002 these changes were instrumental in reducing the rate of increase in our group health costs in 2002 

  

purchased transportation expenses which includes lease operator costs purchased linehaul local transportation services and equipment rentals decreased to 33 of revenue in 2002 from 37 in 2001 when there are capacity restraints within our fleet or when it is economically beneficial we purchase transportation services for our linehaul and local pickup and delivery operations from lease operators other motor carriers and rail providers in 2002 lease operator expenses decreased from 13 of revenue to 12 purchased linehaul services increased to 4 of revenue from 2 and purchased pickup and delivery services decreased to 15 from 19 equipment rentals decreased from 3 of revenue to 2 from the prior year as we continue to expand our services and geographic coverage we intend to decrease our use of purchased transportation and increase the utilization of our employees and equipment 

  

fuel costs including fuel taxes decreased to 73 of revenue in 2002 from 78 in 2001 our general tariffs and contracts generally include provisions for a fuel surcharge recorded in net revenue which have effectively offset significant diesel fuel price fluctuations these surcharges decrease or are eliminated as fuel prices approach certain floor levels 

  

the adoption of statement of financial accounting standard no 142 goodwill and other intangible assets  on january 1 2002 resulted in a decrease in amortization expenses of 737000 in 2002 in addition we also increased our asset utilization as more tonnage moved through our service center network as a result depreciation and amortization expense dropped to 55 of revenue in 2002 from 60 for the prior year 

  

insurance and claims expense increased to 29 of revenue in 2002 from 26 in 2001 on april 1 2002 we renewed many of our major insurance policies at significantly higher renewal rates even after substantially increasing our selfinsured retention levels these higher rates resulted from overall increases in insurance markets which affect the entire transportation industry rather than our specific loss experience 

  

longterm debt including current maturities decreased 53 to 93223000 at december 31 2002 compared to 98422000 at yearend 2001 while debt levels were higher throughout the first 11 months of 2002 we used 16783000 of the net 47878000 in proceeds from our underwritten public offering of stock completed in november 2002 to repay all indebtedness under our revolving line of credit and retire a senior note although our debt levels were higher in 2002 our weighted average interest rate on outstanding debt was lower resulting in a decrease in interest expense to 10 of revenue from 12 in 2001 we capitalized 699000 in interest charges in 2002 compared to 232000 in 2001 

  

the effective tax rate for both 2002 and 2001 was 390 

  

liquidity and capital resources 

  

expansion in both the size and number of service center facilities the planned tractor and trailer replacement cycle and revenue growth have required continued investment in real estate and equipment in order to support these requirements we incurred net capital expenditures of 98441000 during 2003 we funded these capital expenditures with 75064000 in cash generated from operating activities 4203000 in net additional borrowings 966000 from stock issuances resulting from the exercise of stock options and 18208000 of our 2002 ending cash balance that remained from our november 2002 stock offering at december 31 2003 longterm debt including current maturities increased to 97426000 from 93223000 at december 31 2002 

  

we estimate net capital expenditures to be approximately 70000000 to 80000000 for the year ending december 31 2004 of that approximately 51000000 is allocated for the purchase of tractors and trailers 15000000 is allocated for the purchase of service center facilities construction of new service center facilities or expansion of existing service center facilities 10000000 is allocated for investments in technology and the balance is allocated for other assets we plan to fund these capital expenditures primarily through cash flows from operations supplemented by additional borrowings 

  

the table below sets forth our net capital expenditures for the years ended december 31 2003 2002 and 2001 

  

   

on may 31 2000 we entered into an uncollateralized committed credit facility with wachovia bank na formerly first union national bank which as amended consisted of a 20000000 line of credit and a 20000000 line to support standby letters of credit this facility had a term of three years that expired on may 31 2003 but was extended through july 1 2003 interest on this line of credit was charged at rates that varied based upon a certain financial performance ratio the applicable interest rate for 2003 under this agreement was based upon libor plus 60 to 70 a fee ranging from 18 to 20 was charged on the unused portion of the line of credit and fees ranging between 70 and 75 were charged on outstanding standby letters of credit 

  

we entered into an unsecured revolving credit agreement dated june 30 2003 with lenders consisting of wachovia bank na bank of america na and branch banking and trust company with wachovia as agent for the lenders this threeyear facility consists of 80000000 in line of credit commitments from the lenders all of which are available for revolving loans in addition of that 80000000 line of credit 30000000 may be used for letters of credit and 10000000 may be used for borrowings under wachovia’s sweep program the sweep program is a daily cash management tool that automatically initiates borrowings to cover overnight cash requirements up to an aggregate of 10000000 or initiates overnight investments for excess cash balances revolving loans under the facility will bear interest at either a an applicable margin plus the higher of wachovia’s prime rate or onehalf of one percentage point over the federal funds rate the “adjusted base rate” or b libor plus an applicable margin the “adjusted libor rate” the applicable margin will vary depending upon our ratio of adjusted debt to capital in the case of the adjusted base rate the applicable margin will range from 0 to 25 in the case of the adjusted libor rate the applicable margin will range from 75 to 125 the applicable margin under this agreement for 2003 for the adjusted base rate and the adjusted libor rate was 0 and 10 respectively revolving loans under the sweep program will bear interest at the aggregate rate applicable under the sweep program plus the adjusted libor rate 

  

quarterly fees ranging from 20 to 30 will be charged on the aggregate unused portion of the facility determined by our ratio of adjusted debt to capital the applicable rate for the periods under this 

  

agreement in 2003 was 25 quarterly fees will be charged on the aggregate undrawn portion of outstanding letters of credit at a rate ranging from 75 to 125 which was 10 in 2003 as determined by our ratio of adjusted debt to capital in addition a quarterly facing fee at an annual rate of 125 was charged on the aggregate undrawn portion of outstanding letters of credit 

  

the new credit facility contains customary covenants including financial covenants that require us to observe a maximum ratio of adjusted debt to capital to maintain a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio and to maintain a minimum consolidated tangible net worth our wholly owned subsidiary guaranteed payment of all of our obligations under the facility future wholly owned subsidiaries would be required to guarantee payment of all of our obligations under the facility at december 31 2003 there was 14000000 outstanding on the line of credit facility and there was 19403000 outstanding on the standby letter of credit facility 

  

we have three senior note agreements outstanding totaling 70821000 at december 31 2003 these notes call for periodic principal payments with maturities ranging from 2005 to 2008 of which 17107000 is due in 2004 interest rates on these notes are fixed and range from 635 to 759 under the provisions of one of these notes we may issue up to 15000000 of additional senior notes the applicable interest rate and payment schedules for any new notes will be determined and mutually agreed upon at the time of issuance 

  

our senior notes and credit agreement limit the amount of dividends that may be paid to shareholders pursuant to certain financial ratios at december 31 2003 our debt instruments limited the amount of dividends that could be paid to shareholders to 12303000 we did not declare or pay a dividend on our common stock in 2003 and we have no plans to declare or pay a dividend in 2004 

  

with the exception of the line of credit interest rates are fixed on all of our debt instruments therefore shortterm exposure to fluctuations in interest rates is limited to our line of credit facility which had an outstanding balance of 14000000 at december 31 2003 we do not currently use interest rate derivative instruments to manage exposure to interest rate changes also we do not use fuel hedging instruments as our tariff provisions and contracts generally allow for fuel surcharges to be implemented in the event that fuel prices exceed stipulated levels 

  

a significant decrease in demand for our services could limit our ability to generate cash flow and affect profitability most of our debt agreements have covenants that require stated levels of financial performance which if not achieved could cause acceleration of the payment schedules we do not anticipate a significant decline in business levels or financial performance and we believe the combination of our existing credit facilities along with our additional borrowing capacity will be sufficient to meet seasonal and longterm capital needs 

  

the following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of december 31 2003 

  

   

   

   

critical accounting policies 

  

in preparing our consolidated financial statements we apply the following critical accounting policies that affect judgments and estimates of amounts recorded in certain assets liabilities revenue and expenses 

  

revenue and expense recognition  operating revenue is recognized on a percentage of completion method based on average transit time expenses associated with operating revenue are recognized when incurred 

  

allowance for uncollectible accounts  we maintain an allowance for uncollectible accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments additional allowances may be required 

  

claims and insurance accruals – claims and insurance accruals reflect the estimated ultimate total cost of claims including amounts for claims incurred but not reported for cargo loss and damage bodily injury and property damage workers’ compensation longterm disability and group health not covered by insurance these costs are charged to insurance and claims expense except for workers’ compensation longterm disability and group health which are charged to employee benefits expense 

  

we are currently selfinsured for bodily injury and property damage claims up to 1750000 per occurrence cargo loss and damage claims are selfinsured up to 100000 we are selfinsured for workers’ compensation in certain states and have first dollar or high deductible plans in the remaining states with selfinsured retention levels ranging from 250000 to 1000000 group health claims are selfinsured up to 250000 per occurrence and longterm disability claims are selfinsured to a maximum per individual of 3000 per month 

  

insurers providing excess coverage above retention levels adjust their premiums to cover insured losses and for other market factors as a result we periodically evaluate our selfinsured retention levels to determine the most cost efficient balance of selfinsurance and excess coverage 

  

in establishing accruals for claims and insurance expenses we evaluate and monitor each claim individually and we use factors such as historical experience known trends and thirdparty estimates to determine the appropriate reserves for potential liability we believe the assumptions and methods used to estimate these liabilities are reasonable however changes in the severity of previously reported claims significant changes in the medical costs and legislative changes affecting the administration of our plans could significantly impact the determination of appropriate reserves in future periods 

  

goodwill  the excess cost over net assets acquired in connection with acquisitions or goodwill is recorded in “other assets” we adopted statement of financial accounting standard no 142 goodwill and other intangible assets “sfas 142” on january 1 2002 and completed the required analyses of the fair value of our single reporting unit compared to the carrying value as of january 1 2002 october 1 2002 and october 1 2003 based on those analyses we concluded that there was no impairment of goodwill on those measurement dates at december 31 2003 goodwill totaled 10648000 prior to the adoption of sfas 142 these intangible assets were amortized using a straightline method over their estimated useful lives of 3 to 25 years 

  

property and equipment – property and equipment are recorded at cost and depreciated on a straightline basis over their estimated economic lives management uses historical experience certain assumptions and estimates in determining the economic life of each asset periodically we review property and equipment for impairment to include changes in operational and market conditions and we adjust the carrying value and economic life of any impaired asset as appropriate currently estimated economic lives for structures are 5 to 30 years revenue equipment is 2 to 12 years other equipment is 2 to 10 years and leasehold improvements are the lesser of 10 years or the life of the lease the use of different assumptions estimates or significant changes in the resale market for our equipment could result in material changes in the carrying value of our assets 

  

inflation 

  

most of our expenses are affected by inflation which generally results in increased operating costs in response to fluctuations in the cost of petroleum products particularly diesel fuel we have implemented a fuel surcharge in our tariffs and contractual agreements the fuel surcharge is designed to offset the cost of fuel above a base price and increases as fuel prices escalate over the base for 2003 the net effect of inflation on our results of operations was minimal 

  

related party transactions 

  

transactions with old dominion truck leasing inc

the total amount paid to ej for all trailers under lease was 357000 387000 and 401000 for 2003 2002 and 2001 respectively

 item 1   business 

general 

we are a leading lessthantruckload multiregional motor carrier providing timely one to four day service among five regions in the united states and nextday and secondday service within these regions through our nonunion workforce and our four branded product groups oddomestic odglobal odexpedited and odtechnology we offer an array of innovative products and services that provide direct service to 38 states within the southeast south central northeast midwest and west regions of the country including 24 states within which we provide fullstate coverage in addition through marketing and carrier relationships we provide service to and from the remaining 12 states as well as canada mexico and the caribbean 

we have grown substantially over the last several years through strategic acquisitions and internal growth prior to 1995 we provided interregional service to major metropolitan areas from and regional service within the southeast region of the united states since 1995 we have expanded our infrastructure to provide nextday and secondday service within four additional regions as well as expanded interregional service among those regions during this period we increased our number of service centers from 53 to 117 and our states directly served from 21 to 38 we believe that our present infrastructure will enable us to increase freight density the volume of freight moving through our network and thereby improve our profitability 

we are committed to providing our customers with high quality service products we are continually upgrading our technological capabilities to improve our customer service reduce our transit times and minimize our operating costs in addition to our core lessthantruckload or ltl services we provide premium expedited services including guaranteed ontime delivery timespecific delivery and nextday air delivery we also offer container delivery service to and from ten port facilities as well as assembly and distribution services in which we either consolidate ltl shipments for full truckload transport by a truckload carrier or break down full truckload shipments from a truckload carrier into ltl shipments for our delivery 

we combine the rapid transit times of a regional carrier with the geographic coverage of an interregional carrier we believe our transit times are generally faster than those of our principal national competitors in part because of our more efficient service center network use of team drivers and industry leading technology in addition our direct service to 38 states and five regions provides greater geographic coverage than most of our regional competitors we believe our diversified mix and scope of regional and interregional services enable us to provide our customers a single source to meet their ltl shipping needs 

we provide consistent customer service from a single organization offering our customers information and pricing from one point of contact most of our multiregional competitors that offer interregional service do so through independent companies with separate points of contact which can result in inconsistent service and pricing as well as poor shipment visibility our integrated structure allows us to offer our customers consistent and continuous service across regions 

our industry 

trucks provide transportation services to virtually every industry operating in the united states and generally offer higher levels of reliability and faster transit times than other surface transportation options the trucking industry is comprised principally of two types of motor carriers truckload and ltl truckload carriers dedicate an entire trailer to one customer from origin to destination ltl carriers pick up multiple shipments from multiple customers on a single truck and then route the goods through terminals or service centers where freight may be transferred to other trucks with similar destinations for delivery 

in contrast to truckload carriers ltl carriers require expansive networks of local pickup and delivery service centers as well as larger hub facilities significant capital is required of ltl motor carriers to create and maintain a network of service centers and a fleet of tractors and trailers the substantial infrastructure spending needed for ltl carriers makes it difficult for new startup or small operations to effectively compete with established companies 

service center operations 

at december 31 2002 we conducted operations through 117 service center locations of which we own 51 and lease 66 we operate major breakbulk or hub facilities in atlanta georgia rialto california indianapolis indiana greensboro north carolina harrisburg pennsylvania morristown tennessee and dallas texas while using some smaller service centers for limited breakbulk activity in order to serve nextday markets our service centers are strategically located in five regions of the country to permit us to provide the highest quality service and minimize freight rehandling costs 

each of our service centers is responsible for the pickup and delivery of freight for its own service area all inbound freight received by the service center in the evening or during the night is scheduled for local delivery the next business day unless a customer requests a different delivery schedule each service center loads the freight by destination the day it is picked up our management reviews the productivity and service performance of each service center on a daily basis in order to maximize quality service 

while we have established primary responsibility for customer service at the local service center level our customers may access information through several different gateways such as our website electronic data interchange automated voice response systems automated fax systems or through our customer service department located at our corporate office our systems offer direct access to information such as freight tracking shipping documents rate quotes rate databases and account activity 

we plan to expand capacity at existing service centers as well as expand the number of service centers geographically as opportunities arise that provide for profitable growth and fit the needs of our customers 

linehaul transportation 

our linehaul transportation department is responsible for directing the movement of freight among our service centers linehaul dispatchers control the movement of freight among service centers through realtime integrated freight movement systems we also utilize loadplanning software to optimize efficiencies in our linehaul operations our senior management continuously monitors freight movements transit times load factors and other productivity measurements to ensure that we maintain our highest levels of service and efficiency 

we use scheduled dispatches and additional dispatches as necessary to meet our published service standards in addition we lower our cost structure by maintaining flexible work force rules and by using twin 28foot trailers exclusively in our linehaul operations which also reduces cargo claims expenses use of twin 28foot trailers permits us to pick up freight directly from its point of origin to destination with minimal unloading and reloading and permits more freight to be hauled behind a tractor than could be hauled if we used one larger trailer 

tractors and trailers and maintenance 

at december 31 2002 we operated 2752 tractors we generally use new tractors in linehaul operations for approximately three to five years and then transfer those tractors to pickup and delivery operations for the remainder of their useful lives in a number of our service centers tractors perform pickup and delivery functions during the day and linehaul functions at night to maximize tractor utilization 

at december 31 2002 we operated a fleet of 10729 trailers as we have expanded and our needs for equipment have increased we have purchased new trailers as well as trailers meeting our specifications from other trucking companies that have ceased operations these purchases of preowned equipment though providing an excellent value have the effect of increasing the trailer fleet’s average age 

the table below reflects as of december 31 2002 the average age of our tractors and trailers 

 

 we develop certain specifications for tractors and trailers the production and purchase of which are negotiated with several manufacturers these purchases are planned well in advance of anticipated delivery dates in order to accommodate manufacturers’ production schedules we believe that there is sufficient capacity among suppliers to ensure an uninterrupted flow of equipment 

the table below sets forth our capital expenditures for tractors and trailers for the years ended december 31 2002 2001 and 2000 

 

 we currently have major maintenance operations at our service centers in atlanta georgia dallas texas chicago and des plaines illinois harrisburg pennsylvania jersey city new jersey morristown and memphis tennessee los angeles and rialto california columbus ohio greensboro north carolina and greenville south carolina in addition six other service center locations are equipped to perform routine and preventive maintenance checks and repairs on our equipment 

we have an established scheduled maintenance policy and procedure linehaul tractors are routed to appropriate maintenance facilities at designated mileage intervals ranging from 12500 to 25000 miles depending upon how the equipment was utilized pickup and delivery tractors and trailers are scheduled for maintenance every 90 days 

marketing and customers 

at december 31 2002 we had a sales staff of 328 employees we compensate our sales force in part based upon revenue generated company and service center profitability and ontime service performance which we believe helps to motivate our employees 

we utilize a computerized freight costing model to determine the price level at which a particular shipment of freight will be profitable we can modify elements of this freight costing model as necessary to simulate the actual conditions under which the freight will be moved from time to time we also compete for business by participating in bid solicitations customers generally solicit bids for relatively large numbers of shipments for a period of from one to two years and typically choose to enter into a contractual arrangement with a limited number of motor carriers based upon price and service 

revenue is generated from many customers and locations across the united states and north america we currently serve over 57000 customers with direct service to 38 states including 24 with 100 fullstate coverage in addition through marketing and carrier relationships we provide service to the remaining 12 states as well as canada mexico and the caribbean for the year ended december 31 2002 our largest customer accounted for approximately 18 of revenue and our largest 20 10 and five customers accounted for approximately 176 121 and 74 of our revenue respectively for each of the previous three years less than 1 of our revenue was generated through our carrier relationships in canada mexico and the caribbean we believe the 

diversity of our revenue base helps protect our business from adverse developments in a single geographic region and the reduction or loss of business from a single customer 

competition 

the transportation industry is highly competitive on the basis of both price and service we compete with regional interregional and national ltl carriers and to a lesser extent with truckload carriers small package carriers air freight carriers and railroads we believe that we are able to compete effectively in our markets by providing high quality and timely service at competitive prices 

seasonality 

our tonnage levels and revenue mix are subject to seasonal trends common in the motor carrier industry financial results in the first and fourth quarters are normally lower due to reduced shipments during the winter months harsh winter weather can also adversely impact our performance by reducing demand and increasing operating expenses the second and third quarters reflect increased demand for services during the spring and summer months which generally result in improved operating margins 

technology 

we continually upgrade our technological capabilities we provide access to our systems through multiple gateways that offer our customers maximum flexibility and immediate access to necessary information we also employ freight handling systems and logistics technology in an effort to reduce costs and transit times our principal technologies include 

•   wwwodflcom a variety of information and services is available through our awardwinning web site we continuously update our web site with current information including service products coverage maps financial data news releases employment opportunities and other information of importance to our customers investors and employees since november 22 2002 we have made available free of charge on our web site our annual report on form 10k quarterly reports on form 10q current reports on form 8k and amendments to these reports filed or furnished pursuant to section 13a or 15d of the securities exchange act of 1934 as soon as reasonably practical after we electronically file these reports with or furnish them to the securities and exchange commission 

•   odfl4mecom customers may register their accounts on the secure area of our web site odfl4mecom our simple registration gives our customers the freedom to manage their accounts from their desktops create bills of lading get the information they need online easily and efficiently check the realtime status of all active shipments receive interactive rate estimates schedule pickups download rates generate reports and view or print documents 

•   interactive voice response ivr through our ivr telephone system callers can trace shipments develop rate estimates and access our fax server to retrieve shipping documents such as delivery receipts and bills of lading 

•   electronic data interchange edi for our customers who prefer to exchange information electronically we provide a number of edi options with flexible formats and communication alternatives through this system our customers can transmit or receive invoices remittance advices shipping documents shipment status information as well as other customized information 

•   radio frequency identification rfid system this automated arrivaldispatch system monitors equipment location and freight movement throughout our system radio frequency identification tags are installed on all of our tractors and trailers and readers are installed in most of our service centers these tags and readers record arrivals and departures eliminating the need for manual recording and assisting in breakbulk planning 

•   dock yard management dym system the dym system tells us the status of any shipment moving within our system through a network of computers mounted on our freight docks and in each switching tractor when a shipment is scanned its status is updated throughout the 

system handheld computers are used to monitor update and close loads on the dock the dym system is currently installed in 51 of our service centers and is scheduled to be fully installed by july 2004 

•   handheld computer system handheld computers carried by drivers on pickup and delivery tractors provide direct communication with our drivers and allow them to capture realtime information during pickups and deliveries including individual pieces and weights as well as origin and destination shipping points timely pickup information allows for better direct loading and efficient scheduling of linehaul power and enhances realtime information for customer’s visibility of their supply chain we expect the use of handheld computers by our pickup and delivery drivers to be fully implemented by august 2003 

insurance 

we carry significant insurance with third party insurance carriers we are selfinsured for bodily injury and property damage claims up to 1750000 per occurrence cargo claims are selfinsured up to 100000 we also are selfinsured for workers’ compensation in certain states and have first dollar or high deductible plans in the other states we believe that our policy of selfinsuring up to set limits together with our safety and loss prevention programs is an effective means of managing insurance costs we believe that our current insurance coverage is adequate to cover our liability risks 

fuel availability and cost 

our industry depends heavily upon the availability of diesel fuel we have not experienced difficulties in maintaining a consistent and ample supply of fuel in periods of significant price increases we have implemented a fuel surcharge to offset the additional cost of fuel which is consistent with our competitors’ practices however from time to time we experience shortages in the availability of fuel at certain locations and have been forced to incur additional expense to ensure adequate supply on a timely basis our management believes that our operations and financial condition are susceptible to the same fuel price increases or fuel shortages as those of our competitors fuel costs excluding fuel taxes averaged 45 of revenue in 2002 in response to fuel price fluctuations we implemented a fuel surcharge program in august 1999 which has remained in effect since that time 

employees 

as of december 31 2002 we employed 6895 individuals on a fulltime basis in the following categories 

 

 as of december 31 2002 we employed 1527 linehaul drivers and 1983 pickup and delivery drivers all of our drivers are selected based upon driving records and experience drivers are required to pass drug tests and have a current dot physical and a valid commercial driver’s license prior to employment drivers are also required to take drug and alcohol tests periodically by random selection 

to help fulfill driver needs we offer qualified employees the opportunity to become drivers through the “old dominion driver training program” since its inception in 1988 1234 individuals have graduated from this program from which we have experienced an annual turnover rate of approximately 10 in our management’s opinion our driver training and qualification programs have been important factors in improving our safety record drivers with safe driving records are rewarded with bonuses of up to 1000 annually driver safety bonuses paid during 2002 were approximately 688000 

our management believes that relations with our employees are excellent and there are no employees represented under a collective bargaining agreement we believe our nonunion workforce gives us a significant advantage over unionized ltl carriers advantages of our workforce include flexible hours and the ability of our employees to perform multiple tasks which we believe result in greater productivity customer service efficiency and cost savings management’s focus on communication and the continued education development and motivation of our employees ensures that our relationship with our employees remains excellent 

governmental regulation 

we are regulated by the surface transportation board an independent agency within the united states department of transportation and by various state agencies these regulatory authorities have broad powers generally governing matters such as authority to engage in motor carrier operations hours of service certain mergers consolidations and acquisitions and periodic financial reporting the trucking industry is subject to regulatory and legislative changes such as increasingly stringent environmental and occupational safety and health regulations or limits on vehicle weight and size ergonomics and hours of service these changes may affect the economics of the industry by requiring changes in operating practices or by influencing the demand for and the costs of providing services to shippers 

we believe that the cost of compliance with applicable laws and regulations neither has materially affected nor will materially affect our results of operations or financial condition 

environmental regulation 

we are subject to various federal state and local environmental laws and regulations that focus on among other things the emission and discharge of hazardous materials into the environment from our properties and vehicles fuel storage tanks and the discharge or retention of storm water under specific environmental laws we could also be held responsible for any costs relating to contamination at our past or present facilities and at thirdparty waste disposal sites we do not believe that the cost of future compliance with environmental laws or regulations will have a material adverse effect on our operations or financial condition 

risk factors 

in addition to the factors discussed elsewhere in this report the following are some of the important factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those projected in any forwardlooking statements 

we operate in a highly competitive industry and our business will suffer if we are unable to adequately address potential downward pricing pressures and other factors that may adversely affect our operations and profitability 

numerous competitive factors could impair our ability to maintain our current profitability these factors include the following 

•   we compete with many other transportation service providers of varying sizes some of which have more equipment a broader coverage network a wider range of services and greater capital resources than we do or have other competitive advantages 

•   some of our competitors periodically reduce their prices to gain business especially during times of reduced growth rates in the economy which may limit our ability to maintain or increase prices or maintain significant growth in our business 

•   many customers reduce the number of carriers they use by selecting socalled “core carriers” as approved transportation service providers and in some instances we may not be selected 

•   many customers periodically accept bids from multiple carriers for their shipping needs and this process may depress prices or result in the loss of some business to competitors 

•   the trend towards consolidation in the ground transportation industry may create other large carriers with greater financial resources than us and other competitive advantages relating to their size 

•   advances in technology require increased investments to remain competitive and our customers may not be willing to accept higher prices to cover the cost of these investments and 

•   competition from nonassetbased logistics and freight brokerage companies may adversely affect our customer relationships and prices 

if our employees were to unionize our operating costs would increase 

none of our employees are currently represented by a collective bargaining agreement however from time to time there have been efforts to organize our employees at various service centers we have no assurance that our employees will not unionize in the future which could increase our operating costs and force us to alter our operating methods this could in turn have a material adverse effect on our operating results 

difficulty in attracting drivers could affect our profitability 

competition for drivers is intense within the trucking industry and we periodically experience difficulties in attracting and retaining qualified drivers our operations may be affected by a shortage of qualified drivers in the future which could cause us to temporarily underutilize our truck fleet face difficulty in meeting shipper demands and increase our compensation levels for drivers if we encounter difficulty in attracting or retaining qualified drivers our ability to grow our business could be adversely affected 

insurance and claims expenses could significantly reduce our profitability 

we are exposed to claims related to cargo loss and damage property damage personal injury and workers’ compensation we carry significant insurance with third party insurance carriers the cost of such insurance has risen significantly to offset in part the significant increases we have experienced we have elected to increase our selfinsured retention levels from 250000 to 1750000 for personal injury and property damage if the number or severity of claims for which we are selfinsured increases our operating results would be adversely affected insurance companies require us to obtain letters of credit to collateralize our selfinsured retention if these requirements increase our borrowing capacity could be adversely affected 

our business is subject to general economic factors that are largely out of our control 

economic conditions may adversely affect our customers’ business levels the amount of transportation services they need and their ability to pay for our services customers encountering adverse economic conditions represent a greater potential for loss and we may be required to increase our reserve for baddebt losses 

disruptions of port activity on the west coast in 2002 moderately reduced our shipping volume in that region if these disruptions recur our results of operations may be adversely affected 

we have significant ongoing cash requirements that could limit our growth and affect our profitability if we are unable to obtain sufficient financing 

our business is highly capital intensive our capital expenditures in 2002 and 2001 were 700 million and 436 million respectively we expect our capital expenditures for 2003 to be approximately 950 to 1000 million we depend on operating leases lines of credit secured equipment financing and cash flow from operations to finance the purchase of tractors trailers and service centers if we are unable in the future to raise sufficient capital or borrow sufficient funds to 

make these purchases we will be forced to limit our growth and operate our trucks for longer periods of time which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results 

in addition our business has significant operating cash requirements if our cash requirements are high or our cash flow from operations is low during particular periods we may need to seek additional financing which may be costly or difficult to obtain we have begun discussions to renew our credit line which expires in may 2003 but we can provide no assurances that it will be renewed on comparable terms 

we may not realize additional revenues or profits from our infrastructure investments in a timely manner or at all 

we have invested and expect to continue to invest substantial amounts in building expanding and upgrading service center facilities if we are unsuccessful in our strategy for increasing our market share of ltl shipments we may not realize additional revenues or profits from our infrastructure investments in a timely manner or at all 

we may be adversely impacted by fluctuations in the price and availability of fuel 

fuel is a significant operating expense we do not hedge against the risk of fuel price increases any increase in fuel taxes or fuel prices or any change in federal or state regulations that results in such an increase to the extent not offset by freight rate increases or fuel surcharges to customers or any interruption in the supply of fuel could have a material adverse effect on our operating results historically we have been able to offset significant increases in fuel prices through fuel surcharges to our customers but we cannot be certain that we will be able to do so in the future from time to time we experience shortages in the availability of fuel at certain locations and have been forced to incur additional expense to ensure adequate supply on a timely basis 

limited supply and increased prices for new equipment may adversely affect our earnings and cash flow 

investment in new equipment is a significant part of our annual capital expenditures we may face difficulty in purchasing new equipment due to decreased supply in addition some manufacturers have communicated their intention to raise the prices of new equipment the price of our equipment may be adversely affected in the future by regulations on newly manufactured tractors and diesel engines see “— we are subject to various environmental laws and regulations and costs of compliance with liabilities under or violations of existing or future environmental laws or regulations could adversely affect our business” 

we operate in a highly regulated industry and increased costs of compliance with or liability for violation of existing or future regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business 

we are regulated by the surface transportation board an independent agency within the united states department of transportation and by various state agencies these regulatory authorities have broad powers generally governing matters such as authority to engage in motor carrier operations hours of service certain mergers consolidations and acquisitions and periodic financial reporting the trucking industry is subject to regulatory and legislative changes such as increasingly stringent environmental and occupational safety and health regulations or limits on vehicle weight and size ergonomics and hours of service these changes may affect the economics of the industry by requiring changes in operating practices or by influencing the demand for and the costs of providing services to shippers 

we are subject to various environmental laws and regulations and costs of compliance with liabilities under or violations of existing or future environmental laws or regulations could adversely affect our business 

we are subject to various federal state and local environmental laws and regulations regulating among other things the emission and discharge of hazardous materials into the environment from our properties and vehicles fuel storage tanks and the discharge or retention of storm water under 

specific environmental laws we could also be held responsible for any costs relating to contamination at our past or present facilities and at thirdparty waste disposal sites environmental laws have become and are expected to become increasingly more stringent over time and there can be no assurance that our costs of complying with current or future environmental laws or liabilities arising under such laws will not have a material adverse effect on our business operations or financial condition 

the environmental protection agency has issued regulations that require progressive reductions in exhaust emissions from diesel engines through 2007 beginning in october 2002 new diesel engines must meet these new emission limits some of the regulations require subsequent reductions in the sulfur content of diesel fuel beginning in june 2006 and the introduction of emissions aftertreatment devices on newlymanufactured engines and vehicles beginning with model year 2007 these regulations could result in higher prices for tractors and diesel engines and increased fuel and maintenance costs these adverse effects combined with the uncertainty as to the reliability of the vehicles equipped with the newly designed diesel engines and the residual values that will be realized from the disposition of these vehicles could increase our costs or otherwise adversely affect our business or operations 

our results of operations may be affected by seasonal factors and harsh weather conditions 

our operations are subject to seasonal trends common in the trucking industry our operating results in the first and fourth quarters are normally lower due to reduced demand during the winter months harsh weather can also adversely affect our performance by reducing demand and our ability to transport freight and increasing operating expenses 

if we are unable to retain our key employees our business financial condition and results of operations could be harmed 

the success of our business will continue to depend upon our executive officers and we do not have employment agreements with any of them the loss of the services of any of our key personnel could have a material adverse effect on us 

our principal shareholders control a large portion of our outstanding common stock 

earl e congdon and john r congdon and members of their families and their affiliates beneficially own 423 of the outstanding shares of our common stock as long as the congdon family controls a large portion of our voting stock they will be able to significantly influence the election of the entire board of directors and the outcome of all matters involving a shareholder vote the congdon family’s interests may differ from yours 

we may not be able to continue to successfully execute our acquisition strategy which could cause our business and future growth prospects to suffer 

acquisitions have been and continue to be an important part of our growth strategy however suitable acquisition candidates may not be available on terms and conditions we find acceptable in pursuing acquisitions we compete with other companies many of which have greater financial and other resources than we do to acquire attractive companies even if completed the following are some of the risks associated with acquisitions that could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

•   some of the acquired businesses may not achieve anticipated revenues earnings or cash flow 

•   we may assume liabilities that were not disclosed to us or exceed our estimates 

•   we may be unable to integrate acquired businesses successfully and realize anticipated economic operational and other benefits in a timely manner which could result in substantial costs and delays or other operational technical or financial problems 

•   acquisitions could disrupt our ongoing business distract management divert resources and make it difficult to maintain our current business standards controls and procedures 

•   we may finance future acquisitions by issuing common stock for some or all of the purchase price which could dilute the ownership interests of our shareholders and 

•   we may incur additional debt related to future acquisitions 

our business may be harmed by antiterrorism measures 

in the aftermath of the september 11 2001 terrorist attacks on the united states federal state and municipal authorities have implemented and are continuing to implement various security measures including checkpoints and travel restrictions on large trucks if new security measures disrupt or impede the timing of our deliveries we may fail to meet the needs of our customers or may incur increased expenses to do so we cannot assure you that these measures will not have a material adverse effect on our operating results 

our stock price may be volatile and could decline substantially 

our common stock has experienced price and volume fluctuations many factors may cause the market price for our common stock to decline including some of the risks enumerated above in addition if our operating results fail to meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors in any quarter or securities analysts revise their estimates downward our stock price could decline 

in the past companies that have experienced volatility in the market price of their stock have been the subject of securities class action litigation if we become involved in a securities class action litigation in the future it could result in substantial costs and diversion of management attention and resources harming our business 

proposed reforms of corporate governance standards for public companies will require changes in our board of directors 

if current corporate governance proposals of the securities and exchange commission and the board of directors of the nasdaq stock market are approved and implemented we will have to make changes to our board of directors and its committees to increase their independence we cannot assure you that a reconstituted board of directors will provide the expertise and leadership necessary for our continued growth or success

 item 7   management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

overview 

we are a leading lessthantruckload multiregional motor carrier providing one to four day service among five regions in the united states and nextday and secondday service within these regions through our four branded product groups oddomestic odglobal odexpedited and odtechnology we offer an array of innovative products and services that provide direct service to 38 states within the southeast south central northeast midwest and west regions of the country including 24 states within which we provide fullstate coverage in addition through marketing and carrier relationships we provide service to and from the remaining 12 states as well as canada mexico and the caribbean our nonunion workforce operates a fleet of more than 2700 tractors and more than 10700 trailers 

historically over 90 of our revenue is derived from transporting ltl shipments for our customers whose demand for our services is generally tied to the health of the overall economy the majority of direct costs associated with our business are driver and service center wages and benefits operating supplies and expenses and depreciation of our equipment fleet and service center facilities 

results of operations 

the following table sets forth for the years indicated expenses and other items as a percentage of revenue from operations 

 

 2002 compared to 2001 

in 2002 we achieved doubledigit revenue growth improved our operating efficiencies and increased our earnings at a faster rate than revenue growth we achieved these objectives even while the us economy remained sluggish throughout the year primarily by implementing our strategy of growing revenue in our existing areas of operation and improving asset utilization revenue for 2002 increased 128 to 566459000 compared to 502239000 in 2001 our operating ratio a measure of profitability calculated by dividing operating costs by revenue improved to 936 from 

951 and net income improved to 18462000 for 2002 or 551 over net income for 2001 of 11905000 

our revenue growth strategy was based upon increasing market share through improved service products faster transit times and expanded coverage consistent with these objectives we announced fullstate coverage for the state of new hampshire in june 2002 bringing the number of states in which we provide 100 coverage to 24 while expansion plans are closely tied to the strength of the national economy we seek to produce longterm profitable growth by positioning ourselves to expand significantly in stronger economic times and avoiding the risk of overextending ourselves in weaker economic cycles 

revenue growth in 2002 was driven by an 118 increase in the number of shipments handled coupled with a 9 increase in revenue per shipment the improvement in revenue per shipment resulted from a 22 increase in revenue per hundredweight partially offset by a 13 decrease in weight per shipment the improvement in revenue per hundredweight in 2002 was due more to a 30 increase in our average length of haul than to our ability to raise rates or maintain pricing particularly in the first half of the year our average length of haul increased to 903 miles in 2002 from 877 miles in 2001 

a portion of our revenue growth in the second half of the year can be attributed to the increase in freight volume associated with the september 3 2002 bankruptcy of consolidated freightways a major national ltl carrier with annual revenues of 23 billion in 2001 and one of our competitors while we experienced a 77 increase in shipments and a 4 decrease in revenue per shipment in the first half of the year we gained a significant amount of momentum in the second half of the year as reflected by a 159 increase in shipments and a 20 improvement in revenue per shipment we believe this reduction in industry capacity will continue to provide an opportunity for us to expand our customer base improve market share and provide for a more favorable pricing environment for all ltl carriers 

we also benefited from a full year of revenue and increased market share generated by the 13 additional service centers we opened in our south central area on february 10 2001 when we acquired certain assets of carter  sons freightways of carrollton texas we anticipate these markets will continue to mature and be a source of growth in 2003 

as a result of our market share improvements throughout our service center network tonnage increased 103 in 2002 over 2001 enabling us to obtain certain economies of scale as we moved greater concentrations of shipments through our existing route structure and service center network as a result our incremental costs associated with this added volume were generally lower as reflected by the improvement in our operating ratio 

salaries wages and employee benefit expenses the largest component of our cost structure were 602 of revenue in 2002 compared to 610 in 2001 most of these costs were incurred as variable driver and platform labor directly associated with the movement of shipments through our network our driver and platform wages excluding benefit expenses were 326 of revenue in 2002 compared to 330 for 2001 

the cost of providing group health benefits to our employees and their families decreased to 37 of revenue in 2002 from 43 in 2001 after experiencing a 245 increase in these costs in 2001 primarily due to significant increases in the cost of our prescription drug benefit we identified cost savings opportunities that were implemented in january 2002 these changes were instrumental in reducing the rate of increase in our group health costs in 2002 

purchased transportation expenses which includes lease operator costs purchased linehaul local transportation services and equipment rentals decreased to 33 of revenue in 2002 from 37 in 2001 when there are capacity restraints within our fleet or when it is economically beneficial we purchase transportation services for our linehaul and local pickup and delivery operations from lease operators other motor carriers and rail providers in 2002 lease operator expenses decreased from 13 of revenue to 12 purchased linehaul services increased to 4 of revenue from 2 and purchased pickup and delivery services decreased to 15 from 19 equipment rentals decreased from 3 of revenue to 2 from the prior year as we continue to expand our services and 

geographic coverage we intend to decrease our use of purchased transportation and increase the utilization of our employees and equipment 

fuel costs including fuel taxes decreased to 73 of revenue in 2002 from 78 in 2001 our general tariffs and contracts generally include provisions for a fuel surcharge recorded in net revenue which have effectively offset significant diesel fuel price fluctuations these surcharges decrease or are eliminated as fuel prices approach certain floor levels 

the adoption of statements of financial accounting standards no 142 goodwill and other intangible assets  on january 1 2002 resulted in a decrease in amortization expenses of 737000 in 2002 in addition we also increased our asset utilization as more tonnage moved through our service center network as a result depreciation and amortization expense dropped to 55 of revenue in 2002 from 60 for the prior year 

insurance and claims expense increased to 29 of revenue in 2002 from 26 in 2001 on april 1 2002 we renewed many of our major insurance policies at significantly higher renewal rates even after substantially increasing our selfinsured retention levels these higher rates resulted from overall increases in insurance markets which affect the entire transportation industry rather than our specific loss experience 

longterm debt including current maturities decreased 53 to 93223000 at december 31 2002 compared to 98422000 at yearend 2001 while debt levels were higher throughout the first 11 months of 2002 we used 16783000 of the net 47878000 in proceeds from our underwritten public offering of stock completed in november 2002 to repay all indebtedness under our revolving line of credit and retire a senior note although our debt levels were higher in 2002 our weighted average interest rate on outstanding debt was lower resulting in a decrease in interest expense to 10 of revenue from 12 in 2001 we capitalized 699000 in interest charges in 2002 compared to 232000 in 2001 

the effective tax rate for both 2002 and 2001 was 390 

2001 compared to 2000 

while the trucking industry experienced lower demand for transportation products we continued to implement our longterm strategy to increase market share through improved service products and selective geographic expansion on february 10 2001 we purchased selected assets of carter  sons freightways inc of carrollton texas carter  sons operated a regional lessthattruckload network of 23 service centers primarily in texas and surrounding states as a result we opened 13 new service centers and merged the remaining 10 service centers into our existing operations this acquisition allowed us to expand our fullstate coverage to 23 states and enhanced our regional and interregional markets in the continental united states we estimate that the acquisition generated approximately 23000000 of additional revenue in 2001 

a weak national economy compounded by the terrorist attacks on september 11 2001 impacted our ability to reach our financial performance goals for 2001 while revenue grew to 502239000 or 56 over 2000 increases in operating costs outpaced revenue growth and resulted in a 131 decline in net income to 11905000 compared to 13696000 in 2000 diluted earnings per share for the year was 143 compared to 165 a decrease of 133 our operating ratio for 2001 a measure of profitability calculated by dividing operating costs by revenue increased to 951 from 944 in 2000 

although total tonnage decreased 4 in 2001 when compared with 2000 ltl tonnage shipments weighing less than 10000 lbs increased 54 because ltl shipments generally are priced at higher revenue per hundredweight our revenues increased while tonnage decreased net revenue per hundredweight was 1011 compared to 954 for the prior year an increase of 60 

we operated 115 service centers at yearend 2001 compared to 104 service centers in 2000 these additional service centers required us to increase our tractor and trailer fleet by 66 and 61 respectively increases in the number of service centers and the equipment fleet combined with relatively flat tonnage between 2001 and 2000 generated excess capacity and a resulting increase in depreciation and amortization expense to 60 of revenue from 57 for 2000 

linehaul driver pay increased to 123 of revenue from 118 in 2000 a result of an increase in intercity miles driven without a comparable increase in revenue per mile intercity miles increased 74 while revenue per intercity mile decreased 17 an indication that linehaul density declined between the two periods 

we selfinsure a significant portion of the group health benefits we provide for our employees and their families these costs increased 245 or 4269000 over the prior year and significantly contributed to the increase in our operating ratio in anticipation of continued increases in health care costs consistent with national trends we implemented cost savings initiatives in january 2002 to offset a portion of these costs 

fuel expense decreased to 51 of revenue from 56 in 2000 our general tariffs and contracts generally include provisions for a fuel surcharge recorded in net revenue which has effectively offset significant diesel fuel price fluctuations we seek to apply these surcharges until prices fall below certain floor levels 

results for 2001 also include the sale and disposition of land and structures which included both operating and nonoperating properties operating properties were sold for gains before taxes totaling 2114000 and were recorded in “miscellaneous expenses net” “other income expense net” included the sale and disposal of nonoperating assets for a net gain before taxes of 772000 

as a result of a higher average level of debt outstanding during 2001 interest expense increased to 12 of revenue from 9 outstanding debt was 98422000 at december 31 2001 compared to 83542000 at december 31 2000 an increase of 178 this increase in debt is primarily due to increased working capital requirements and to additional financing required to fund 46963000 of net capital expenditures in 2001 we capitalized 232000 in interest charges in 2001 compared to 1031000 in 2000 

the tax rate for both 2001 and 2000 was 39 

liquidity and capital resources 

expansion in both the size and number of service center facilities the planned tractor and trailer replacement cycle and revenue growth have required continued investment in real estate and equipment in order to support these requirements we incurred net capital expenditures of 69105000 during 2002 cash flows generated internally funded 642 of the capital expenditures for the year while the remainder was funded by proceeds received through a stock offering completed in november 2002 at december 31 2002 longterm debt including current maturities decreased to 93223000 from 98422000 at december 31 2001 

we estimate net capital expenditures to be approximately 95000000 to 100000000 for the year ending december 31 2003 of that approximately 48000000 is allocated for the purchase of tractors and trailers 41000000 is allocated for the purchase or construction of larger replacement service centers or expansion of existing service centers 10000000 is allocated for investments in technology and the balance is allocated for other assets we plan to fund these capital expenditures primarily through cash flows from operations supplemented by the remaining proceeds from our november 2002 stock offering and additional borrowings 

the table below sets forth our capital expenditures for the years ended december 31 2002 2001 and 2000 excluding assets acquired as part of business acquisitions

on may 31 2000 we entered into an uncollateralized committed credit facility with wachovia bank national association formerly first union national bank which as amended consists of a 20000000 line of credit and a 20000000 line to support standby letters of credit this facility has a term of three years that expires on may 31 2003 and we are currently negotiating the renewal of this credit agreement interest on the line of credit is charged at rates that vary in a range of libor plus 60 to 85 based upon a fixed charge coverage ratio the applicable interest rate for 2002 under this agreement was based upon libor plus 70 to 85 a fee ranging from 20 to 25 was charged on the unused portion of the line of credit and fees ranging between 70 to 75 were charged on outstanding standby letters of credit standby letters of credit are primarily issued as collateral for selfinsured retention reserves for bodily injury property damage and workers’ compensation claims at december 31 2002 there were no amounts outstanding on the line of credit and 16535000 outstanding on the standby letter of credit facility 

we have four individual senior note agreements outstanding totaling 76929000 at december 31 2002 these notes call for periodic principal and interest payments with maturities ranging from 2005 through 2008 of which 6107000 is due in 2003 interest rates on these notes are fixed and range from 635 to 759 under the provisions of one of these notes we may issue up to 15000000 of additional senior notes the applicable interest rate and payment schedules for any new notes will be determined and mutually agreed upon at the time of issuance 

our senior notes and credit agreement limit the amount of dividends that may be paid to shareholders pursuant to certain financial ratios at december 31 2002 our debt instruments limited the amount of dividends that could be paid to shareholders to 79327000 we did not declare or pay a dividend on our common stock in 2002 and we have no plans to declare or pay a dividend in 2003 

with the exception of the line of credit interest rates are fixed on all of our debt instruments therefore shortterm exposure to fluctuations in interest rates is limited to our line of credit facility which had no outstanding balance at december 31 2002 we do not currently use interest rate derivative instruments to manage exposure to interest rate changes also we do not use fuel hedging instruments as our tariff provisions generally allow for fuel surcharges to be implemented in the event that fuel prices exceed stipulated levels 

in november 2002 we issued and sold in an underwritten public offering 2304124 shares of common stock in exchange for net proceeds of 47878000 we used 13783000 of the total proceeds to repay all indebtedness outstanding under our committed credit facility we used 3000000 to repay a maturing senior note issued in 1996 which bears a 73 interest rate and matured on december 15 2002 the balance of the proceeds will be used to fund scheduled debt payments in 2003 fund the scheduled replacement cycle of our existing equipment which consists primarily of tractors and trailers and to fund our growth strategy which includes the purchase and expansion of service centers 

a significant decrease in demand for our services could limit our ability to generate cash flow and affect profitability most of our debt agreements have covenants that require stated levels of financial performance which if not achieved could cause acceleration of the payment schedules we do not anticipate a significant decline in business levels or financial performance and we believe the combination of our existing credit facilities along with our additional borrowing capacity will be sufficient to meet seasonal and longterm capital needs 

the following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of december 31 2002 

 18 

 

   1   contractual obligations include longterm debt consisting primarily of senior notes totaling 76929000 capital lease obligations for tractors trailers and computer equipment and offbalance sheet operating leases primarily consisting of real estate leases 

  2   other commercial commitments consist of standby letters of credit used as collateral for selfinsured retention of insurance claims 

critical accounting policies 

in preparing our consolidated financial statements we apply the following critical accounting policies that affect judgments and estimates of amounts recorded in certain assets liabilities revenue and expenses 

revenue and expense recognition – operating revenue is recognized on a percentage of completion method based on average transit time expenses associated with operating revenue are recognized when incurred 

allowance for uncollectible accounts – we maintain an allowance for uncollectible accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments additional allowances may be required 

claims and insurance accruals – claims and insurance accruals reflect the estimated ultimate total cost of claims including amounts for claims incurred but not reported for cargo loss and damage bodily injury and property damage workers’ compensation longterm disability and group health not covered by insurance these costs are charged to insurance and claims expense except for workers’ compensation longterm disability and group health which are charged to employee benefits expense 

from april 1 2001 through march 31 2002 we were selfinsured for bodily injury and property damage claims up to 250000 per occurrence cargo claims were selfinsured up to 100000 however after the first two losses exceeded 100000 in the policy year the retention under our excess insurance policy was reduced to 50000 per occurrence we were also selfinsured for workers’ compensation in certain states and had first dollar or high deductible plans in the remaining states 

due to recent losses incurred by the insurance industry rates offered by insurers for many types of coverage have significantly increased over the prioryear renewal rates as a result we determined that additional risk in the form of higher retention levels was warranted and effective april 1 2002 selfinsured retention for bodily injury and property damage increased to 1750000 per claim while the selfinsured retention for cargo claims increased to 100000 per claim this combination of increased premiums and additional reserve requirements for selfinsurance caused insurance expense to increase to 29 of operating revenue in 2003 from 26 in the previous year 

in establishing accruals for claims and insurance expenses we evaluate and monitor each claim individually and we use factors such as historical experience known trends and thirdparty estimates to determine the appropriate reserves for potential liability we believe the assumptions and methods used to estimate these liabilities are reasonable however changes in the severity of previously reported claims significant changes in the medical costs and legislative changes affecting the administration of our plans could significantly impact the determination of appropriate reserves in future periods 

goodwill – the excess cost over net assets acquired in connection with acquisitions is recorded in “other assets” we adopted statements of financial accounting standards no 142 goodwill and other intangible assets “sfas 142” on january 1 2002 and completed the required analyses of the 

fair value of our single reporting unit compared to the carrying value as of january 1 2002 and october 1 2002 based on those analyses we concluded that there was no impairment of these assets which totaled 10656000 at yearend 2002 

prior to the adoption of sfas 142 these intangible assets were amortized using a straightline method over their estimated useful lives of three to 25 years at december 31 2001 goodwill totaled 10663000 which included 1667000 of accumulated amortization 

property and equipment – property and equipment are recorded at cost and depreciated on a straightline basis over their estimated economic lives management uses historical experience certain assumptions and estimates in determining the economic life of each asset periodically we review property and equipment for impairment to include changes in operational and market conditions and we adjust the carrying value and economic life of any impaired asset as appropriate currently estimated economic lives for structures are five to 30 years revenue equipment is two to 12 years other equipment is two to 10 years and leasehold improvements are the lesser of 10 years or the life of the lease the use of different assumptions estimates or significant changes in the resale market for our equipment could result in material changes in the carrying value of our assets 

inflation 

most of our expenses are affected by inflation which generally results in increased operating costs in response to fluctuations in the cost of petroleum products particularly diesel fuel we have implemented a fuel surcharge in our tariffs and contractual agreements the fuel surcharge is designed to offset the cost of fuel above a base price and increases as fuel prices escalate over the base for 2002 the net effect of inflation on our results of operations was minimal

greensboro nc service center purchase 

on october 15 2002 we purchased a 116door service center facility and shop located in greensboro nc for 6000000 from an irrevocable trust created for the benefit of the families of earl e congdon our chief executive officer and chairman of our board of directors and john r congdon vice chairman of our board of directors prior to october 15 2002 this property was leased to us with payments totaling 285000 380000 and 377000 for 2002 2001 and 2000 respectively 

transactions with old dominion truck leasing inc 

old dominion truck leasing inc “leasing” a north carolina corporation whose voting stock is owned by the earl e congdon intangibles trust david s congdon trustee the john r congdon revocable trust and members of earl e congdon’s and john r congdon’s families is engaged in the business of purchasing and leasing tractors trailers and other vehicles john r congdon is chairman of the board and earl e congdon is vice chairman of the board of leasing since 1986 leasing and we have combined our requirements for the purchase of tractors trailers equipment parts tires and fuel we believe that by combining our requirements we are often able to obtain pricing discounts because of the increased level of purchasing while this is beneficial to us our management believes that the termination of this relationship would not have a material adverse impact on our financial results 

for the years ended december 31 2002 2001 and 2000 we charged leasing 14000 11000 and 15000 respectively for vehicle repair maintenance and other services which we provide to leasing at cost in addition we charged leasing 12000 annually in 2002 2001 and 2000 for rental of a vehicle maintenance facility located in chesapeake virginia 

we purchased 297000 287000 and 244000 of maintenance and other services from leasing in 2002 2001 and 2000 respectively we believe that the prices we pay for such services are lower than would be charged by unaffiliated third parties for the same quality of work and we intend to continue to purchase maintenance and other services from leasing provided that leasing’s prices continue to be favorable to us in addition leasing has a right of first refusal for our future tractor and trailer leases exercisable on the same terms offered to us by third parties we did not lease any 

equipment from leasing in 2002 but we paid leasing 8000 and 4000 for shortterm tractor rentals in 2001 and 2000 respectively
