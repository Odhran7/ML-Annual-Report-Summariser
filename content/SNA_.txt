markets 

sales and distribution 

snapon markets and distributes its products and related services principally to professional tool and equipment users around the world the two largest market sectors are the vehicle service and repair sector and the industrial sector 

vehicle service and repair sector 

the vehicle service and repair sector has three main customer groups i professional technicians who purchase tools diagnostics and equipment products for use in their work ii other professional customers related to vehicle repair including owners and managers of independent repair shops and oem dealerships who purchase tools diagnostics and equipment products for use by multiple technicians within a service or repair facility and iii oems

the market for vehicle service and repair is driven by an increasing rate of technological change car and truck population growth and increasing unit life and the resulting effects of these changes on the businesses of both our suppliers and customers in recent years there has been an increase in the development and sales of electric and hybrid vehicles and this trend is expected to continue snapon has historically benefited from the increasing complexity of car and truck fleets and the changing tools technologies and data needed to monitor calibrate service and repair evolving vehicle platforms while new technologies including those associated with alternative energy drivetrains and greater vehicle autonomy may alter the nature of certain service and repair for particular vehicle types we believe many of these new technologies provide opportunities to fulfill requirements for enhanced solutions or increased precision snapon believes it is wellpositioned to innovate new products to address these changing needs and to extend its leadership position in the expanding vehicle service and repair market sector 

industrial sector 

snapon markets its products and services globally to a broad crosssection of commercial and industrial customers including maintenance and repair operations manufacturing and assembly facilities various government agencies facilities and operations including military operations schools with vocational and technical programs aviation and aerospace operations oil and gas developers mining operations power generation operations including those associated with alternative energies equipment fabricators and operators railroad manufacturing and maintenance customers in agriculture infrastructure construction companies and other customers that require instrumentation service tools andor equipment for their products and business needs the industrial sector for snapon focuses on providing valueadded products and services to an increasingly expanding global base of customers in critical industries 





the industrial sector is characterized by a highly competitive environment with multiple suppliers offering either a full line or industryspecific portfolios for tools and equipment industrial customers increasingly require specialized solutions that provide repeatability and reliability in performing tasks of consequence that are specific to the particular end market in which they operate snapon believes it is a meaningful participant in the industrial tools and equipment market sector 

distribution channels 

snapon serves customers primarily through the following channels of distribution i the mobile van channel ii company direct sales iii distributors and iv ecommerce the following discussion summarizes snapon’s general approach for each channel and is not intended to be allinclusive 

mobile van channel 

in the united states a significant portion of sales to the vehicle service and repair sector is conducted through snap‑on’s mobile franchise van channel snapon’s franchisees primarily serve vehicle repair technicians and vehicle service shop owners generally providing weekly contact at the customer’s place of business franchisees’ sales are concentrated in hand and power tools tool storage products shop equipment diagnostics and repair information products which can be transported in a van or trailer and demonstrated during a sales call franchisees purchase snapon’s products at a discount from suggested list prices and resell them at prices established by the franchisee us franchisees are provided a list of calls that serves as the basis of the franchisee’s sales route snapon’s franchisees also have the opportunity to add a limited number of additional franchises 

snapon charges nominal initial and ongoing monthly franchise fees franchise fee revenue including nominal nonrefundable initial and ongoing monthly fees primarily for sales and business training marketing and product promotion programs and technology support is recognized as the fees are earned franchise fee revenue totaled 173 million 162 million and 154 million in fiscal 2021 2020 and 2019 respectively

company direct sales 

a significant proportion of shop equipment sales in north america under the john bean hofmann blackhawk caroliner challenger and procut brands diagnostic products under the snapon brand and information and shop management products under the mitchell1 brand are made by direct and independent sales forces that have responsibility for national and other accounts as the vehicle service and repair sector consolidates with more business conducted by national chains and franchised service centers snapon believes these larger organizations can be serviced most effectively by sales people who can demonstrate and sell the full line of diagnostics equipment and services snapon also sells these products and services directly to oems and their franchised dealers 





snapon brand tools and equipment are marketed to industrial and governmental customers worldwide through both industrial sales associates and independent distributors selling activities focus on industrial customers whose main purchase criteria are quality and integrated solutions as of 2021 year end snapon had industrial sales associates and independent distributors primarily in the united states canada and in various european latin american middle eastern asian and african countries with the united states representing the majority of snapon’s total industrial sales

competition 

snapon competes on the basis of its product quality and performance product line breadth and depth service brand awareness and imagery technological innovation and availability of financing through soc or its international finance subsidiaries while snapon does not believe that any single company competes with it across all of its product lines and distribution channels various companies compete in one or more product categories andor distribution channels 

snapon believes it is a leading manufacturer and distributor of professional tools tool storage diagnostics equipment products and repair software and solutions offering a broad line of these products to both vehicle service and industrial marketplaces various competitors target and sell to professional technicians in the vehicle service and repair sector through the mobile tool distribution channel snapon also competes with companies that sell tools and equipment to vehicle service and repair technicians online and through retail stores vehicle parts supply outlets and tool supply warehousesdistributorships within the power tools category and the industrial sector snapon has various other competitors including companies with offerings that overlap with other areas discussed herein major competitors selling diagnostics shop equipment and information to vehicle dealerships and independent repair shops include oems and their proprietary electronic parts catalogs and diagnostics and information systems and other companies that offer products serving this sector

 item 1a risk factors 

in evaluating the company careful consideration should be given to the following risk factors in addition to the other information included in this annual report on form 10k including the consolidated financial statements and the related notes each of these risk factors could adversely affect and in some cases may have already affected the company’s business operating results cash flows andor financial condition as well as adversely affect the value of an investment in the company’s common stock 

risk related to covid19 and other infectious diseases 

the ongoing covid19 pandemic is expected to continue to pose risks to our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows and other epidemics or outbreaks of infectious diseases may have a similar impact 

we face risks related to outbreaks of infectious diseases including the ongoing covid19 pandemic in response to covid19 national and local governments around the world instituted certain measures including travel bans prohibitions on group events and gatherings shutdowns of certain businesses curfews shelterinplace orders and recommendations to practice social distancing existing measures may be extended in certain regions and additional measures may be imposed to combat the covid19 pandemic or future outbreaks of infectious diseases 

among the effects of covid19 and potential effects of other similar outbreaks on the company could include but are not limited to reduced consumer and investor confidence instability in the credit and financial markets volatile corporate profits supply chain inefficiencies and reduced business and consumer spending which could adversely affect our results of operations by reducing our sales margins andor net income as a result of rising costs a slowdown in customer orders or order cancellations to the extent the covid19 pandemic or a future outbreak adversely affects our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows it may also heighten many of the other risks described in this section the ultimate impact of covid19 as well as future outbreaks of infectious diseases is dependent on future developments including the duration of the pandemic and the related length of its impact on the global economy which are uncertain and cannot be predicted at this time 

business risks 

the sales of many of our products are dependent on the health of the vehicle repair market and the changing requirements of vehicle repair 

we believe sales of many of our products are dependent on the changing vehicle repair requirements the number of vehicles on the road the general aging of vehicles and the number of miles driven these factors affect the frequency type and amount of service and repair performed on vehicles by technicians and therefore affect the demand for the number of technicians the prosperity of technicians and consequently the demand technicians have for our tools other products and services as well as the value technicians place on those products and services the use of other methods of transportation including more frequent use of public transportation in the future could result in a decrease in the use of privatelyoperated vehicles a decrease in the use of privatelyoperated vehicles may lead to fewer repairs and less demand for our products 





in addition the number of electric and hybrid vehicles developed and sold has risen in recent years and is expected to continue to increase in the future while we believe that advances in vehicle technologies provide us with opportunities to provide innovative products and solutions to the vehicle repair market if we are not able to execute on those possibilities our business and results of operations could suffer 

the performance of snapon’s mobile tool distribution business depends on the success of its franchisees 

approximately 42 of our consolidated net revenues in 2021 were generated by the snapon tools group which consists of snapon’s business operations primarily serving vehicle service and repair technicians through the company’s worldwide mobile tool distribution channel snapon’s success is dependent on its relationships with franchisees individually and collectively as they are the primary sales and service link between the company and vehicle service and repair technicians who are an important class of end users for snapon’s products and services 

if our franchisees are not successful or if we do not maintain an effective relationship with our franchisees the delivery of products the collection of receivables andor our relationship with end users could be adversely affected and thereby negatively impact our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

in addition if we are unable to maintain effective relationships with franchisees snapon or the franchisees may choose to terminate the relationship which may result in i open routes in which enduser customers are not provided reliable service ii litigation resulting from termination iii reduced collections or increased chargeoffs of franchisee receivables owed to snapon andor iv reduced collections or increased chargeoffs of finance and contract receivables 

the inability to continue to introduce new products that respond to customer needs and achieve market acceptance could result in lower revenues and reduced profitability 

sales from new products represent a significant portion of our net sales and are expected to continue to represent a significant component of our future net sales we may not be able to compete effectively unless we continue to enhance existing products or introduce new products to the marketplace in a timely manner product improvements and new product introductions require significant financial and other resources including significant planning design development sourcing and testing at the technological product and manufacturing process levels our competitors’ new products may beat our products to market be more effective contain more features be less expensive than our products andor render our products obsolete any new products that we develop may not receive market acceptance or otherwise generate any meaningful net sales or profits for us relative to our expectations based on among other things existing and anticipated investments in manufacturing capacity and commitments to fund advertising marketing promotional programs and research and development 

failure to adequately protect intellectual property or claims of infringement could adversely affect our business reputation financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

intellectual property rights are an important and integral component of our business and failure to obtain or maintain adequate protection of our intellectual property rights for any reason could have a material adverse effect on our business we attempt to protect our intellectual property rights through a combination of patent trademark copyright and trade secret laws as well as licensing agreements and thirdparty nondisclosure and assignment agreements in addition we have been and in the future may be subject to claims of intellectual property infringement against us by third parties whether or not these claims have merit we could be required to expend significant resources in defense of those claims adverse determinations in a judicial or administrative proceeding or via a settlement could prevent us from manufacturing and selling our products prevent us from stopping others from manufacturing and selling competing products andor result in payments for damages in the event of an infringement claim we may also be required to spend significant resources to develop alternatives or obtain licenses which may not be available on reasonable terms or at all and may reduce our sales and disrupt our production failure to obtain or maintain adequate protection of our intellectual property rights for any reason could have a material adverse effect on our business 





the global tool equipment diagnostics and repair information industries are competitive 

we face strong competition in all of our market segments price competition in our various industries is intense and pricing pressures from competitors and customers continue to increase in general as a manufacturer and marketer of premium products and services the expectations of snapon’s customers and its franchisees are high and continue to increase any inability to maintain customer satisfaction could diminish snapon’s premium image and reputation and could result in a lessening of our ability to command premium pricing we expect that the level of competition will remain high in the future which could limit our ability to maintain or increase market share or profitability 

foreign operations are subject to political economic and other risks that could adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

approximately 31 of our revenues in 2021 were generated outside of the united states future growth rates and success of our business depends in large part on continued growth in our nonus operations including growth in emerging markets and critical industries numerous risks and uncertainties affect our nonus operations these include political economic and social instability such as acts of war armed conflicts civil disturbance or acts of terrorism local labor conditions trade relations with china changes in government policies and regulations including those intended to address climate change imposition or increases in withholding and other taxes on remittances and other payments by international subsidiaries as well as exposure to liabilities under antibribery and anticorruption laws in various countries such as the us foreign corrupt practices act currency volatility transportation delays or interruptions sovereign debt uncertainties and difficulties in enforcement of contract and intellectual property rights reputational risks related to among other factors different standards and practices among countries as well as natural disasters weather events and outbreaks of infectious diseases should the economic environment in our nonus markets deteriorate from current levels our results of operations and financial position could be materially impacted including as a result of the effects of potential impairment writedowns of goodwill andor other intangible assets related to these businesses 

the united kingdom “uk” has formally left the european union “brexit” as part of the agreement between the uk and the european union regarding brexit there is a new series of customs and regulatory checks including rules of origin and stringent local content requirements there are also restrictions on the free movement of people and temporary visas for workrelated purposes have been reintroduced the implications of brexit including disruptions to trade and the movement of goods services and people between the uk and the european union or other countries may lead to additional cost delays and volatility in currency exchange rates as well as create legal and global economic uncertainty these and other potential implications could adversely affect our business and results of operations 

operational risks 

risks associated with the disruption of manufacturing operations could adversely affect our profitability or competitive position 

we manufacture a significant portion of the products we sell any prolonged disruption in the operations of our existing manufacturing facilities whether due to technical or labor difficulties facility consolidation or closure actions lack of raw material or component availability destruction of or damage to any facility as a result of natural disasters climate or weather events use and storage of hazardous materials acts of war sabotage terrorism civil unrest or other events or other reasons including outbreaks of infectious diseases such as the ongoing covid19 pandemic could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 





price fluctuations and shortages of raw materials components certain purchased finished goods and energy sources could adversely affect the ability to obtain needed materials or products and could adversely affect our results of operations 

snapon’s supply of raw materials and purchased components are generally available from numerous suppliers and the company continuously works to expand its supplier base to ensure availability the principal raw material used in the manufacture of our products is steel which we purchase in competitive pricesensitive markets to meet snapon’s high quality standards our steel needs range from specialized alloys which are available only from a limited group of approved suppliers to common alloys which are available from multiple suppliers some of these materials have been and in the future may be in short supply particularly in the event of mill shutdowns or production cut backs in addition outbreaks of infectious diseases weather events or other circumstances beyond our control could also impact the availability of raw materials and components physical risks of climate change may also impact the availability and cost of materials sources and supply of energy and could also increase operating costs raw materials components and certain purchased finished goods can exhibit price and demand cyclicality including as a result of tariffs other trade protection measures inflationary factors and supply chain inefficiencies associated unexpected variability could result in an increase in product costs and require snapon to increase prices to maintain margins 

we use various energy sources to transport produce and distribute products and some of our products have components that are petroleum based petroleum and energy prices have periodically increased significantly over short periods of time future volatility and changes may be caused by market fluctuations supply and demand currency fluctuations production and transportation disruptions climate change regulations world events and changes in governmental programs energy price increases raise both our operating costs and the costs of our materials and we may not be able to increase our prices enough to offset these costs in certain areas higher prices also may reduce the level of future customer orders and our profitability 

failure to maintain effective distribution of products and services could adversely impact revenue gross margin and profitability 

we use a variety of distribution methods to sell our products and services successfully managing the interaction of our distribution efforts to reach various potential customer segments for our products and services is a complex process moreover since each distribution method has distinct risks costs and gross margins our failure to implement the most advantageous balance in the delivery model for our products and services could adversely affect our revenue gross margins and profitability 

data security and information technology infrastructure and security are critical to supporting business objectives failure of our systems to operate effectively could adversely affect our business and reputation 

we depend heavily on information technology infrastructure to achieve our business objectives and to protect sensitive information and continually invest in improving such systems problems that impair or compromise this infrastructure including natural disasters power outages major network failures security breaches or malicious attacks or during system upgrades andor new system implementations could impede our ability to record or process orders manufacture and ship in a timely manner manage our financial services operations including originating processing accounting for and collecting receivables protect sensitive data of the company our customers our suppliers and business partners or otherwise carry on business in the normal course any such events if significant could cause us to lose customers andor revenue and could require us to incur significant expense to remediate including as a result of legal or regulatory claims proceedings fines or penalties and could also damage our reputation while we have taken steps to maintain adequate data security and address these risks and uncertainties by implementing security technologies internal controls network and data center resiliency and redundancy and recovery processes as well as by securing insurance these measures may be inadequate these risks may be heightened when associates work remotely 

in association with initiatives to better integrate business units rationalize our operating footprint and improve responsiveness to franchisees and customers snapon is continually enhancing its global enterprise resource planning erp management information systems as we integrate implement and deploy new information technology processes and enhance our information infrastructure across our global operations we could experience disruptions in our business that could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 





failure to attract retain and effectively manage qualified personnel could lead to a loss of revenue andor profitability 

snapon’s success depends in part on the efforts and abilities of its senior management team and other key employees their skills experience and industry contacts significantly benefit our operations and administration the failure to attract and retain members of our senior management team and other key employees to effectively develop personnel and to execute succession plans could have a negative effect on our operating results in addition transitions of important responsibilities to new individuals inherently include the possibility of disruptions to our business and operations which could negatively affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we may not successfully integrate businesses we acquire which could have an adverse impact on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

the pursuit of growth through acquisitions including participation in joint ventures involves significant risks that could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows these risks include 

• loss of the acquired businesses’ customers 

• inability to integrate successfully the acquired businesses’ operations 

• inability to coordinate management and integrate and retain employees of the acquired businesses 

• unforeseen or contingent liabilities of the acquired businesses 

• large writeoffs or writedowns or the impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets 

• difficulties in implementing and maintaining consistent standards controls procedures policies and information systems 

• failure to realize anticipated synergies economies of scale or other anticipated benefits or to maintain operating margins 

• strain on our personnel systems and resources and diversion of attention from other priorities 

• incurrence of additional debt and related interest expense and 

• the dilutive effect in the event of the issuance of additional equity securities 

the steps taken to restructure operations rationalize operating footprint lower operating expenses and achieve greater efficiencies in the supply chain could disrupt business 

we have taken steps in the past and may take additional steps in the future intended to improve customer service and drive further efficiencies as well as reduce costs some of which could be disruptive to our business future efforts to reduce components of expense could result in the recording of charges for inventory and technologyrelated writeoffs workforce reduction costs or other charges relating to the consolidation or closure of facilities if we were to incur a substantial charge or are unable to effectively manage our cost reduction and restructuring efforts our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected in certain periods 

financial risks 

our inability to provide acceptable financing alternatives to franchisees and other enduser customers could adversely impact our operating results 

an integral component of our business and profitability is our ability to offer competitive financing alternatives to franchisees and other enduser customers the lack of our ability to offer such alternatives or obtain capital resources or other financing to support our receivables on terms that we believe are attractive whether resulting from the state of the financial markets our own operating performance or other factors would negatively affect our operating results and financial condition adverse fluctuations in interest rates andor our ability to provide competitive financing programs could also have an adverse impact on our revenue and profitability 





exposure to credit risks of customers and resellers may make it difficult to collect receivables and our allowances for credit losses for receivables may prove inadequate which could adversely affect operating results and financial condition 

a decline in industry andor economic conditions could have the potential to weaken the financial position of some of our customers including financial services customers if circumstances surrounding our customers’ ability to repay their credit obligations were to deteriorate and result in the writedown or writeoff of such receivables it would negatively affect our operating results for the relevant period and if large could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

the company maintains allowances for credit losses for receivables to provide for defaults and nonperformance these allowances represent an estimate of losses over the remaining contractual lives of our receivables which include current market conditions and estimates for reasonable and supportable forecasts when appropriate the determination of the appropriate levels of the allowances for credit losses involves a high degree of subjectivity and judgement and requires the company to make estimates of credit risks which may undergo material changes as a result of economic conditions and other factors the company’s allowances may not be adequate to cover actual losses and future allowances for credit losses could materially and adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

foreign operations are subject to currency exchange inflation interest and other risks that could adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

the reporting currency for snapon’s consolidated financial statements is the us dollar certain of the company’s assets liabilities expenses and revenues are denominated in currencies other than the us dollar in preparing snapon’s consolidated financial statements those assets liabilities expenses and revenues are translated into us dollars at applicable exchange rates increases or decreases in exchange rates between the us dollar and other currencies affect the us dollar value of those items as reflected in the consolidated financial statements substantial fluctuations in the value of the us dollar or other transactional currencies could have a significant impact on the company’s financial condition and results of operations 

we are also affected by changes in inflation rates and interest rates additionally cash generated in certain nonus jurisdictions may be difficult to repatriate to the united states in a taxefficient manner our foreign operations are also subject to other risks and challenges such as the need to staff and manage diverse workforces respond to the needs of multiple national and international marketplaces and differing business climates and cultures in various countries 

adverse developments in the credit and financial markets could negatively impact the availability of credit that we and our customers need to operate our businesses 

we depend upon the availability of credit to operate our business including the financing of receivables from enduser customers that are originated by our financial services businesses our enduser customers franchisees and suppliers also require access to credit for their businesses at times world financial markets have been unstable and subject to uncertainty adverse developments in the credit and financial markets or unfavorable changes in snapon’s credit rating could negatively impact the availability of future financing and the terms on which it might be available to snapon its enduser customers franchisees and suppliers inability to access credit or capital markets or a deterioration in the terms on which financing might be available could have an adverse impact on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

increasing our financial leverage could affect our operations and profitability 

the maximum available credit under our multicurrency revolving credit facility is 800 million the company’s leverage ratio may affect both our availability of additional capital resources as well as our operations in several ways including 

• the terms on which credit may be available to us could be less attractive both in the economic terms of the credit and the covenants stipulated by the credit terms 

• the possible lack of availability of additional credit or access to the commercial paper market 

• the potential for higher levels of interest expense to service or maintain our outstanding debt 

• the possibility of additional borrowings in the future to repay our indebtedness when it comes due and 

• the possible diversion of capital resources from other uses 

while we believe we will have the ability to service our debt and obtain additional resources in the future if and when needed that will depend upon our results of operations and financial position at the time the thencurrent state of the credit and financial markets and other factors that may be beyond our control therefore we cannot give assurances that credit will be available on terms that we consider attractive or at all if and when necessary or beneficial to us 





failure to achieve expected investment returns on pension plan assets as well as changes in interest rates or plan demographics could adversely impact our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

snapon sponsors various defined benefit pension plans the “pension plans” the assets of the pension plans are diversified in an attempt to mitigate the risk of a large loss required funding for the company’s domestic defined benefit pension plans is determined in accordance with guidelines set forth in the federal employee retirement income security act “erisa” foreign defined benefit pension plans are funded in accordance with local statutes or practice additional contributions to enhance the funded status of the pension plans can be made at the company’s discretion however there can be no assurance that the value of the pension plan assets or the investment returns on those plan assets will be sufficient to meet the future benefit obligations of such plans in addition during periods of adverse investment market conditions and declining interest rates the company may be required to make additional cash contributions to the pension plans that could reduce our financial flexibility changes in plan demographics including an increase in the number of retirements or changes in life expectancy assumptions may also increase the costs and funding requirements of the obligations related to the company’s pension plans 

our pension plan obligations are affected by changes in market interest rates significant fluctuations in market interest rates have added and may further add volatility to our pension plan obligations in periods of declining market interest rates our pension plan obligations generally increase in periods of increasing market interest rates our pension plan obligations generally decrease while our plan assets are broadly diversified there are inherent market risks associated with investments if adverse market conditions occur our plan assets could incur significant or material losses since we may need to make additional contributions to address changes in obligations andor a loss in plan assets the combination of declining market interest rates past or future plan asset investment losses andor changes in plan demographics could adversely impact our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

the company’s pension plan expense is comprised of the following factors i service cost ii interest on projected benefit obligations iii expected return on plan assets iv the amortization of prior service costs and credits v effects of actuarial gains and losses and vi settlementcurtailment costs when applicable the accounting for pensions involves the estimation of a number of factors that are highly uncertain certain factors such as the interest on projected benefit obligations and the expected return on plan assets are impacted by changes in market interest rates and the value of plan assets a significant decrease in market interest rates and a decrease in the fair value of plan assets would increase net pension expense and may adversely affect the company’s future results of operations see note 12 to the consolidated financial statements for further information on the company’s pension plans 

the recognition of impairment charges on goodwill or other intangible assets would adversely impact our future financial condition and results of operations 

we have a substantial amount of goodwill and purchased intangible assets almost all of which are booked in the commercial  industrial group and in the repair systems  information group we are required to perform impairment tests on our goodwill and other intangibles annually or at any time when events occur that could impact the value of our business segments our determination of whether impairment has occurred is based on a comparison of each of our reporting units’ fair market value with its carrying value 

significant and unanticipated changes in circumstances such as significant and longterm adverse changes in business climate adverse actions by regulators unanticipated competition the loss of key customers andor changes in technology or markets could require a provision for impairment in a future period that could substantially impact our reported earnings and reduce our consolidated net worth and shareholders’ equity should the economic environment in these markets deteriorate our results of operations and financial position could be materially impacted including as a result of the effects of potential impairment writedowns of goodwill andor other intangible assets related to these businesses 

legal and regulatory risks 

legislation and regulations relating to our business and the countries where we operate including those related to sustainability matters as well as any changes to such legislation or regulations in addition to new compliance obligations or a failure to maintain existing compliance requirements may if significant affect our business reputation results of operations and financial condition 

significant changes to legislative and regulatory activity and compliance burdens including those associated with i sales to our government military and defense contractor customers and ii classification of third parties including our franchisees as independent from the company as well as the manner in which they are applied could significantly impact our business and the economy as a whole 





financial services businesses of all kinds are subject to significant and complex regulations and enforcement in addition to potentially increasing the costs and other requirements of doing business due to compliance obligations new laws and regulations or changes to existing laws and regulations as well as the enforcement thereof may affect the relationships between creditors and debtors inhibit the rights of creditors to collect amounts owed to them expand liability for certain actions or inaction or limit the types of financial products or services offered any or all of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows failure to comply with any of these laws or regulations could also result in civil criminal monetary andor nonmonetary penalties damage to our reputation andor the incurrence of remediation costs 

in recent years there has been increased public awareness concern and focus on environmental and sustainability issues including matters related to global climate change the current focus on these matters is expected to result in additional andor more restrictive regulations requirements andor industry or thirdparty standards to reduce or mitigate global warming and other environmental or sustainability risks though the timing is uncertain 

increased regulatory requirements or standards may result in increased compliance or input costs including those related to energy or raw materials for us and our suppliers if environmental laws or regulations or industry standards are either changed or adopted and impose significant operational restrictions and compliance requirements upon the company the companys business reputation results of operations financial condition and competitive position could be negatively impacted for example if significant increases in fuel economy requirements or changes to vehicle emissions requirements for internal combustion engine vehicles were imposed there could be a decrease in demand for such vehicles and a reduction in miles driven which could adversely impact the demand for certain of our products and services furthermore an inability to successfully manage climate change or sustainability matters or to effectively respond to new or changes in legal or regulatory requirements concerning sustainability matters or increased operating or manufacturing costs due to changes in the regulatory environment could adversely affect our business 

these developments and other potential future legislation and regulations including the increasing global regulation of privacy rights may also adversely affect the customers to which and the markets into which we sell our products and increase our costs and otherwise negatively affect our business reputation results of operations and financial condition including in ways that cannot yet be foreseen 

product liability claims and litigation could affect our business reputation financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

the products that we design andor manufacture andor the services we provide can lead to product liability claims or other legal claims being filed against us to the extent that plaintiffs are successful in showing that a defect in a product’s design manufacture or warnings led to personal injury or property damage or that our provision of services resulted in similar injury or damage we may be subject to claims for damages although we are insured for damages above a certain amount we bear the costs and expenses associated with defending claims including frivolous lawsuits and are responsible for damages up to the insurance retention amount in addition to claims concerning individual products as a manufacturer we can be subject to costs potential negative publicity and lawsuits related to product recalls which could adversely impact our results of operations and damage our reputation 

legal disputes could adversely affect our business reputation financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

from time to time we are subject to legal disputes that are being litigated andor settled in the ordinary course of business disputes or future lawsuits could result in the diversion of management’s time and attention away from business operations additionally negative developments with respect to legal disputes and the costs incurred in defending ourselves even if successful could have an adverse impact on the company and its reputation successful outcomes at trial or on appeal can never be assured adverse outcomes or settlements could also require us to pay damages potentially in excess of amounts reserved or incur liability for other remedies that could have a material adverse effect on our business reputation financial condition results of operations and cash flows 





our operations expose us to the risk of environmental liabilities costs litigation and violations that could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and reputation 

certain of our operations are subject to environmental laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which they operate which impose limitations on the discharge of pollutants into the ground air and water and establish standards for the generation treatment use storage and disposal of hazardous wastes we must also comply with various health and safety regulations in the united states and abroad in connection with our operations failure to comply with any of these laws could result in civil and criminal monetary and nonmonetary penalties and damage to our reputation in addition we may incur costs related to remedial efforts or alleged environmental damage associated with past or current waste disposal practices we cannot provide assurance that our costs of complying with current or future environmental protection and health and safety laws will not exceed our estimates 

the inability to successfully defend claims from taxing authorities could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we conduct business in many countries which requires us to interpret the income tax laws and rulings in each of those taxing jurisdictions due to the subjectivity of tax laws in and between jurisdictions as well as the subjectivity of factual interpretations our estimates of income tax liabilities may differ from actual payments or assessments claims from taxing authorities related to these differences could have an adverse impact on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

general risk factor 

economic conditions and world events could affect our operating results 

in addition to the specific risks above we our franchisees and our customers may be adversely affected by changing economic conditions including conditions that may particularly impact specific regions these conditions may result in reduced consumer and investor confidence instability in the credit and financial markets volatile corporate profits and reduced business and consumer spending we our franchisees and our customers and the economy as a whole also may be affected by future world or local events outside our control such as tariffs and other trade protection measures put in place by the united states or other countries acts of terrorism developments in the war on terrorism armed conflicts civil unrest conflicts in international situations weather events and natural disasters outbreaks of infectious diseases such as the ongoing covid19 pandemic as well as governmentrelated developments or issues including changes in tax laws and regulations including regulations related to climate change and other sustainability matters and changes in financial accounting standards these factors may affect the results of operations by reducing our sales margins andor net earnings as a result of a slowdown in customer orders or order cancellations impact the availability andor pricing of raw materials andor the supply chain and could potentially lead to future impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets in addition political social turmoil international conflicts and terrorist acts may put pressure on global economic conditions unstable political social and economic conditions may make it difficult for our franchisees customers suppliers and us to accurately forecast and plan future business activities if such conditions persist our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows could be negatively affected

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

management overview 

we believe our 2021 operating results demonstrate the continued momentum of our operations and confirms the resilience of our markets and our considerable capabilities to overcome the challenges of the covid environment throughout the turbulence we maintained and further developed our ongoing advantages in our products brands and people at the same time we leveraged existing proficiencies to focus on expanding our professional customer base not only in automotive repair but in adjacent markets additional geographies and other areas including critical industries where the cost and penalties for failure can be high snapon’s value proposition of making work easier for serious professionals is an ongoing strength as we move forward along our runways for coherent growth 

• enhancing the franchise network where we continued to focus on helping our franchisees extend their reach through innovative selling processes and productivity initiatives that break the traditional time and space barriers inherent in a mobile van 

• expanding with repair shop owners and managers where we continued to make progress in connecting with customers and translating the resulting insights into innovation that solves specific challenges in the repair facility 

• further extending to critical industries where we continued to grow our lines of products customized for specific industries including through further integration of acquisitions and 

• building in emerging markets where we continued to maintain manufacturing capacity as well as refine product lines and distribution capabilities 

our strategic priorities and plans for 2022 involve continuing to build on our snapon value creation processes – our suite of strategic principles and processes we employ every day designed to create value and employed in the areas of safety quality customer connection innovation and rapid continuous improvement “rapid continuous improvement” or “rci” we expect to continue to deploy these processes in our existing operations as well as into our recently acquired businesses 

snapon’s rci initiatives employ a structured set of tools and processes across multiple businesses and geographies intended to eliminate waste and improve operations savings from snapon’s rci initiatives reflect benefits from a wide variety of ongoing efficiency productivity and process improvements including savings generated from product design cost reductions improved manufacturing line setup and changeover practices lowercost sourcing initiatives and facility consolidations unless individually significant it is not practicable to disclose each rci activity that generated savings andor segregate rci savings embedded in sales volume increases 

our global financial services operations continue to serve a significant strategic role in offering financing options to our franchisees to their customers and to customers in other parts of our business we expect that our global financial services business which includes both snapon credit llc “soc” in the united states and our other international finance subsidiaries will continue to be a meaningful contributor to our operating earnings going forward 

snapon has significant international operations and is subject to risks inherent with foreign operations including foreign currency translation fluctuations

nongaap measures 

references in this management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations to “organic sales” refer to sales from continuing operations calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america “gaap” adjusted to exclude acquisitionrelated sales and the impact of foreign currency translation management evaluates the company’s sales performance based on organic sales growth which primarily reflects growth from the company’s existing businesses as a result of increased output expanded customer base geographic expansion new product development and pricing changes and excludes sales contributions from acquired operations the company did not own as of the comparable prioryear reporting period organic sales also exclude the effects of foreign currency translation as foreign currency translation is subject to volatility that can obscure underlying business trends management believes that the nongaap financial measure of organic sales is meaningful to investors as it provides them with useful information to aid in identifying underlying growth trends in the company’s businesses and facilitates comparisons of its sales performance with prior periods 

effect of covid19

environmental matters 

snapon is subject to various federal state and local government requirements regulating the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment snapon’s policy is to comply with these requirements and the company believes that as a general matter its policies practices and procedures are properly designed to prevent unreasonable risk of environmental damage and of resulting financial liability in connection with its business some risk of environmental damage is however inherent in some of snapon’s operations and products as it is with other companies engaged in similar businesses 

snapon is and has been engaged in the handling manufacture use and disposal of many substances classified as hazardous or toxic by one or more regulatory agencies snapon believes that as a general matter its handling manufacture use and disposal of these substances are in accordance with environmental laws and regulations it is possible however that future knowledge or other developments such as improved capability to detect substances in the environment or increasingly strict environmental laws and standards and enforcement policies could affect the company’s handling manufacture use or disposal of these substances 

in recent years there has been increased public awareness concern and focus on environmental and sustainability issues including matters related to global climate change the current focus on these matters is expected to result in additional andor more restrictive regulations requirements andor industry or thirdparty standards to reduce or mitigate global warming and other environmental or sustainability risks though the timing is uncertain snapon is monitoring developments in this area 

new accounting standards 

see note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for information on new accounting standards 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the consolidated financial statements and related notes contain information that is pertinent to management’s discussion and analysis the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america “gaap” requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period these estimates are generally based on historical experience current conditions and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily available from other sources as well as identifying and assessing our accounting treatment with respect to commitments and contingencies actual results could differ from those estimates 

in addition to the company’s significant accounting policies described in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements snapon considers the following policies and estimates to be the most critical in understanding the judgments that are involved in the preparation of the company’s consolidated financial statements and the uncertainties that could impact the company’s financial position results of operations and cash flows 

allowance for credit losses on finance receivables the allowance for credit losses on finance receivables is maintained at a level management believes is adequate to cover expected losses in snapon’s finance receivables portfolio as of the reporting date the allowance represents management’s estimate of the expected losses in the company’s finance receivables portfolio based on ongoing assessments and evaluations of credit losses over the expected contractual life of the receivables portfolio considering collectability historical loss experience current conditions and future market changes determination of the proper level of allowance requires management to exercise judgment about the timing frequency and severity of credit losses that could materially affect the provision for credit losses and as a result net earnings the allowance takes into consideration numerous quantitative and qualitative factors that include receivable type historical loss experience delinquency trends collection experience current and future economic conditions and credit risk characteristics some of these factors are influenced by items such as the customers’ financial condition past payment experience credit bureau and proprietary snapon credit model information as well as the value of the underlying collateral changes in economic conditions and assumptions including the resulting credit quality metrics relative to the performance of the finance receivables portfolio create uncertainty and could result in changes to both the allowance for credit losses and provision for credit losses 





management utilizes established policies and procedures in an effort to ensure the estimates and assumptions are well controlled reviewed and consistently applied as of january 1 2022 the ratio of the allowance for credit losses to finance receivables was 390 as of january 2 2021 the allowance ratio was 438 while management believes it exercises prudent judgment and applies reasonable assumptions in establishing its estimates for allowances for finance receivables there can be no assurance that changes in economic conditions or other factors would not adversely impact the financial health of our customers and result in changes to the estimates used in the allowance calculation for reference a 100 bps increase in the allowance ratios for finance receivables as of january 1 2022 would have increased snapon’s 2021 provision for credit losses and related allowance for credit losses by approximately 172 million 

for additional information on snapon’s allowances for credit losses see note 1 and note 4 to the consolidated financial statements 

impairment of goodwill goodwill is tested for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the assets might be impaired annual impairment tests are performed by the company in the second quarter of each year using information available as of april month end 

snapon evaluates the recoverability of goodwill by estimating the future discounted cash flows of the businesses to which the goodwill relates estimated cash flows and related goodwill are grouped at the reporting unit level the company has determined that its reporting units for testing goodwill impairment are its operating segments or components of an operating segment that constitute a business for which discrete financial information is available and for which segment management regularly reviews the operating results within its four reportable operating segments the company has identified 11 reporting units 

snapon evaluates the recoverability of goodwill by utilizing an income approach that estimates the fair value of the future discounted cash flows of the reporting units to which the goodwill relates the future projections which are based on both past performance and the projections and assumptions used in the company’s operating plans are subject to change as a result of changing economic and competitive conditions this approach reflects management’s internal outlook at the reporting units which management believes provides the best determination of value due to management’s insight and experience with the reporting units significant estimates used by management in the discounted cash flows methodology include estimates of future cash flows based on expected growth rates price increases working capital levels expected benefits from rci initiatives and a weightedaverage cost of capital that reflects the specific risk profile of the reporting unit being tested the company’s methodologies for valuing goodwill are applied consistently on a yearoveryear basis the assumptions used in performing the second quarter 2021 impairment calculations were evaluated in light of thencurrent market and business conditions snapon continues to believe that the future discounted cash flow valuation model provides the most reasonable and meaningful fair value estimate based upon the reporting units’ projections of future operating results and cash flows and replicates how market participants would value the company’s reporting units in an orderly transaction 

in the event the fair value of a reporting unit is less than the carrying value including goodwill the company would then record an impairment charge based on the excess of a reporting units carrying amount over its fair value 

inherent in fair value determinations are significant judgments and estimates including material assumptions about future revenue profitability and cash flows the company’s operational plans and its interpretation of current economic indicators should the operations of the businesses with which goodwill is associated incur significant declines in profitability and cash flow due to significant and longterm deterioration in macroeconomic industry and market conditions the loss of key customers changes in technology or markets significant changes in key personnel or litigation a significant and sustained decrease in share price andor other events including effects from the sale or disposal of a reporting unit some or all of the recorded goodwill could be subject to impairment and could result in a material adverse effect on snapon’s financial position or results of operations 





snapon completed its annual impairment testing of goodwill in the second quarter of 2021 which did not result in any impairment as of 2021 year end the company has no accumulated impairment losses although the company consistently uses the same methods in developing the assumptions and estimates underlying the fair value calculations such estimates are uncertain by nature and can vary from actual results in performing its annual impairment testing the company performed a sensitivity analysis on the material assumptions used in the discounted cash flow valuation models for each of its 11 reporting units based on the company’s second quarter 2021 impairment testing and assuming a hypothetical 10 decrease in the estimated fair values of each of its 11 reporting units the hypothetical fair value of each of the company’s 11 reporting units would have been greater than its carrying value see note 7 to the consolidated financial statements for further information about goodwill 

pension benefits the pension benefit obligation and related pension expense are calculated in accordance with gaap and are impacted by certain actuarial assumptions changes in these assumptions are primarily influenced by factors outside of snapon’s control such as changes in economic conditions and can have a significant effect on the amounts reported in the financial statements snapon believes that the two most critical assumptions are i the expected return on plan assets and ii the assumed discount rate 

snapon’s domestic pension plans have a longterm investment horizon and a total return strategy that emphasizes a capital growth objective in 2021 the longterm investment performance objective for snapon’s domestic plans’ assets was to achieve net of expense returns that met or exceeded the 675 domestic expected return on plan assets assumption snapon uses a threeyear marketrelated value asset method of amortizing the difference between actual and expected returns on its domestic plans’ assets as of 2021 year end snapon’s domestic pension plans’ assets comprised approximately 86 of the company’s worldwide pension plan assets 

based on forwardlooking capital market expectations snapon selected an expected return on plan assets assumption for its us pension plans of 650 a decrease of 25 bps from 2021 to be used in determining pension expense for 2022 in estimating the domestic expected return on plan assets snapon utilizes a nominal returns forecasting method for each asset class future returns are estimated by identifying the premium of riskier asset classes over lower risk alternatives the methodology constructs expected returns using a “building block” approach to the individual components of total return these forecasts are stated in both nominal and real after inflation terms this process first considers the longterm historical return premium based on the longest set of data available for each asset class these premiums calculated using the geometric mean are then adjusted based on current relative valuation levels macroeconomic conditions and the expected alpha related to active investment management the asset return assumption is also adjusted by an implicit expense load for estimated administrative and investmentrelated expenses since asset allocation is a key determinant of expected investment returns the current and expected mix of plan assets are also considered when setting the assumption 

pension expense increases as the expected rate of return on plan assets decreases lowering the expected rate of return assumption for snapon’s domestic pension plans’ assets by 50 bps would have increased snapon’s 2021 domestic pension expense by approximately 62 million 

the objective of snapon’s discount rate assumption is to reflect the rate at which the pension benefits could be effectively settled in making this determination the company takes into account the timing and amount of benefits that would be available under the plans the domestic discount rate as of 2021 and 2020 year end was selected based on a cash flow matching methodology developed by the company’s outside actuaries and which incorporates a review of current economic conditions this methodology matches the plans’ yearly projected cash flows for benefits and service costs to those of hypothetical bond portfolios using highquality aa rated or better corporate bonds from either moody’s investors service or standard  poor’s credit rating agencies available at the measurement date this technique calculates bond portfolios that produce adequate cash flows to pay the plans’ projected yearly benefits and then selects the portfolio with the highest yield and uses that yield as the recommended discount rate 





the selection of the 29 weightedaverage discount rate for snapon’s domestic pension plans as of 2021 year end compared to 27 as of 2020 year end represents the single rate that produces the same present value of cash flows as the estimated benefit plan payments lowering snapon’s domestic discount rate assumption by 50 bps would have increased snapon’s 2021 domestic pension expense and projected benefit obligation by approximately 40 million and 770 million respectively as of 2021 year end snapon’s domestic projected benefit obligation comprised approximately 82 of snapon’s worldwide projected benefit obligation the weightedaverage discount rate for snapon’s foreign pension plans of 20 compared to 17 as of 2020 year end represents the single rate that produces the same present value of cash flows as the estimated benefit plan payments lowering snapon’s foreign discount rate assumption by 50 bps would have increased snapon’s 2021 foreign pension expense and projected benefit obligation by approximately 24 million and 278 million respectively 

actuarial gains and losses in excess of 10 percent of the greater of the projected benefit obligation or marketrelated value of assets are amortized on a straightline basis over the average remaining service period of active participants or over the average remaining life expectancy for plans with primarily inactive participants prior service costs and credits resulting from plan amendments are amortized in equal annual amounts over the average remaining service period of active participants or over the average remaining life expectancy for plans with primarily inactive participants 

to determine the 2022 net periodic benefit cost snapon is using weightedaverage discount rates for its domestic and foreign pension plans of 29 and 20 respectively and an expected return on plan assets for its domestic pension plans of 650 the expected returns on plan assets for foreign pension plans ranged from 13 to 56 as of 2021 year end due to the net change in these two key assumptions in addition to the overall benefit plan status snapon expects to have pension income in 2022 other factors such as changes in plan demographics and discretionary contributions may further increase or decrease pension income in 2022 see note 12 to the consolidated financial statements for further information on pension plans 

outlook 

covid19 its subsequent variants as well as related supply chain inefficiencies continue to impact economic activity worldwide in 2022 snapon is accommodating to the virusrelated turbulence and is capitalizing on opportunities in this mixed environment the company believes that our markets and our operations possess and indeed have demonstrated considerable resilience against the impact of the virus and that there will be ongoing advancement even in the midst of the pandemic the trajectory however may be uncertain due to the evolving nature and duration of the situation 

snapon expects to make continued progress in 2022 along its defined runways for coherent growth leveraging capabilities already demonstrated in the automotive repair arena and developing and expanding its professional customer base not only in automotive repair but in adjacent markets additional geographies and other areas including extending in critical industries where the cost and penalties for failure can be high in pursuit of these initiatives it is projected that capital expenditures in 2022 will be in a range of 90 million to 100 million snapon continues to respond to global macroeconomic challenges through its rci process and other cost reduction initiatives 

snapon currently anticipates that its full year 2022 effective income tax rate will be in the range of 23 to 24 








 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

market credit and economic risks 

market risk is the potential economic loss that may result from adverse changes in the fair value of financial instruments snapon is exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates snapon is also exposed to market risk associated with the stockbased portion of its deferred compensation plans snapon monitors its exposure to these risks and attempts to manage the underlying economic exposures through the use of financial instruments such as foreign currency forward contracts interest rate swap agreements treasury lock agreements and prepaid equity forward agreements “equity forwards” snapon does not use derivative instruments for speculative or trading purposes snapon’s broadbased business activities help to reduce the impact that volatility in any particular area or related areas may have on its operating earnings as a whole snapon’s management takes an active role in the risk management process and has developed policies and procedures that require specific administrative and business functions to assist in the identification assessment and control of various risks 

foreign currency risk management 

snapon has significant international operations and is subject to certain risks inherent with foreign operations that include currency fluctuations foreign currency exchange risk exists to the extent that snapon has payment obligations or receipts denominated in currencies other than the functional currency including intercompany loans denominated in foreign currencies to manage these exposures snapon identifies naturally offsetting positions and then purchases hedging instruments to protect the residual net exposures see note 11 to the consolidated financial statements for information on foreign currency risk management 

interest rate risk management 

snapon aims to control funding costs by managing the exposure created by the differing maturities and interest rate structures of snapon’s borrowings through the use of interest rate swap agreements treasury lock agreements are used from time to time to manage the potential change in interest rates in anticipation of the issuance of fixed rate debt see note 11 to the consolidated financial statements for information on interest rate risk management 

snapon utilizes a valueatrisk “var” model to determine the potential oneday loss in the fair value of its interest rate and foreign exchangesensitive financial instruments from adverse changes in market factors the var model estimates were made assuming normal market conditions and a 95 confidence level snapon’s computations are based on the interrelationships among movements in various currencies and interest rates variancecovariance technique these interrelationships were determined by observing interest rate and foreign currency market changes over the preceding quarter 

the estimated maximum potential net oneday loss in fair value calculated using the var model as of 2021 and 2020 year end was 206 million and 139 million respectively on interest ratesensitive financial instruments and 03 million and 01 million respectively on foreign currencysensitive financial instruments the var model is a risk management tool and does not purport to represent actual losses in fair value that will be incurred by snapon nor does it consider the potential effect of favorable changes in market factors 

stockbased deferred compensation risk management 

snapon aims to manage market risk associated with the stockbased portion of its deferred compensation plans through the use of equity forwards equity forwards are used to aid in offsetting the potential marktomarket effect on stockbased deferred compensation from changes in snapon’s stock price since stockbased deferred compensation liabilities increase as the company’s stock price rises and decrease as the company’s stock price declines the equity forwards are intended to mitigate the potential impact on deferred compensation expense that may result from such marktomarket changes see note 11 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on stockbased deferred compensation risk management 





credit risk 

credit risk is the possibility of loss from a customer’s failure to make payments according to contract terms prior to extending credit each customer is evaluated taking into consideration various factors including the customer’s financial condition past payment experience credit bureau information and other financial and qualitative factors that may affect the customer’s ability to repay as well as the value of the underlying collateral finance receivable credit risk is also monitored regularly through the use of internal proprietary custom scoring models to evaluate each transaction at the time of the application for credit snap‑on evaluates credit quality through the use of an internal proprietary measuring system that provides a framework to analyze finance receivables on the basis of risk factors of the individual obligor as well as transaction specific risk the finance receivables are typically monitored through an asset quality review process that closely monitors past due accounts and initiates a progressive collection action process when appropriate 

counterparty risk 

snapon is exposed to credit losses in the event of nonperformance by the counterparties to its various financial agreements including its foreign currency forward contracts interest rate swap agreements treasury lock agreements and prepaid equity forward agreements snapon does not obtain collateral or other security to support financial instruments subject to credit risk but monitors the credit standing of the counterparties and generally enters into agreements with financial institution counterparties with a credit rating of a or better snapon does not anticipate nonperformance by its counterparties but cannot provide assurances 

economic risk 

economic risk is the possibility of loss resulting from economic instability in certain areas of the world snapon continually monitors its exposure in these markets for example the company is monitoring the impact of and developments related to the ongoing covid19 pandemic which continues to have an impact on the global economy while inflation has become more prevalent in the world economy snapon has taken steps to control and offset associated cost increases through its supply chain management pricing actions and deployment of rapid continuous improvement “rci” in addition the company continues to monitor developments related to the united kingdom’s exit from the european union and the effects this may have on the world economy and the company 

as a result of the above market credit and economic risks net earnings and revenues in any particular period may not be representative of fullyear results and may vary significantly from year to year

markets

snapon markets and distributes its products and related services principally to professional tool and equipment users around the world the two largest market sectors are the vehicle service and repair sector and the industrial sector 

vehicle service and repair sector

distribution channels 

snapon serves customers primarily through the following channels of distribution i the mobile van channel ii company direct sales iii distributors and iv ecommerce the following discussion summarizes snapon’s general approach for each channel and is not intended to be allinclusive 





mobile van channel 

in the united states a significant portion of sales to the vehicle service and repair sector is conducted through snapon’s mobile franchise van channel snapon’s franchisees primarily serve vehicle repair technicians and vehicle service shop owners generally providing weekly contact at the customer’s place of business franchisees’ sales are concentrated in hand and power tools tool storage products shop equipment and diagnostic and repair information products which can be transported in a van or trailer and demonstrated during a sales call franchisees purchase snapon’s products at a discount from suggested list prices and resell them at prices established by the franchisee us franchisees are provided a list of calls that serves as the basis of the franchisee’s sales route snapon’s franchisees also have the opportunity to add a limited number of additional franchises

a significant proportion of shop equipment sales in north america under the john bean hofmann blackhawk caroliner challenger and procut brands diagnostic products under the snapon brand and information and shop management products under the mitchell1 brand are made by direct and independent sales forces that have responsibility for national and other accounts as the vehicle service and repair sector consolidates with more business conducted by national chains and franchised service centers snapon believes these larger organizations can be serviced most effectively by sales people who can demonstrate and sell the full line of diagnostic and equipment products and services snapon also sells these products and services directly to oems and their franchised dealers

 item 1a risk factors 

in evaluating the company careful consideration should be given to the following risk factors in addition to the other information included in this annual report on form 10k including the consolidated financial statements and the related notes each of these risk factors could adversely affect the company’s business operating results cash flows andor financial condition as well as adversely affect the value of an investment in the company’s common stock 

risk related to covid19 and other infectious diseases 

the covid19 pandemic has adversely affected and is expected to continue to pose risks to our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows and other epidemics or outbreaks of infectious diseases may have a similar impact 

we face risks related to outbreaks of infectious diseases including the ongoing covid19 pandemic covid19 spread across the globe during 2020 and continues to impact economic activity worldwide covid19 caused disruption and volatility in the global capital markets and authored an economic slowdown during 2020 the covid19 pandemic and its associated economic uncertainty negatively impacted snapon’s sales volumes in 2020 in most geographies and across a variety of customers including those in automotive repair with the impact most pronounced in the first and second quarters of 2020 in response to covid19 national and local governments around the world instituted certain measures including travel bans prohibitions on group events and gatherings shutdowns of certain businesses curfews shelterinplace orders and recommendations to practice social distancing these measures resulted in attenuating activity and in some cases required temporary closures of certain of our facilities among other impacts in 2020 the duration of these measures may be extended and additional measures may be imposed to combat the covid19 pandemic or future outbreaks of infectious diseases 

among the effects of covid19 and potential effects of other similar outbreaks on the company include but are not limited to the following 

• reduced consumer and investor confidence instability in the credit and financial markets volatile corporate profits and reduced business and consumer spending which may adversely affect our results of operations by reducing our sales margins andor net income as a result of a slowdown in customer orders or order cancellations in addition volatility in the financial markets could increase the cost of capital andor limit its availability 

• economic uncertainties that make it difficult for our franchisees customers suppliers and the company to accurately forecast and plan future business activities 





• as a result of government orders and social distancing some of our franchisees would be expected to make fewer inperson sales calls during any such outbreak reflecting the reluctance of some customers to receive franchisee visits further shelterinplace orders could cause vehicle owners to temporarily refrain from bringing cars to repair shops to the extent that there is significantly reduced driving due to shelterinplace and similar orders and the aftermath of such orders there could be fewer repairs and there could be a decrease in demand for our products in addition some repair shops may not be able to stay in business if these conditions continue to exist for an extended period of time 

• the potential to weaken the financial position of some of our customers including customers utilizing our financing programs if circumstances surrounding our customers’ financial capabilities were to deteriorate writedowns or writeoffs could negatively affect our operating results and if large or ongoing for extended periods could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flow 

• disruptions could occur to our supply chain in connection with the sourcing of materials from geographic areas that continue to be impacted by an outbreak and by efforts to contain its spread 

• volatility related to pension plan assets while our plan assets are broadly diversified there are inherent market risks associated with investments we may need to make additional contributions to address an increase in obligations andor a loss in plan assets as a result of the combination of declining market interest rates andor past or future plan asset investment losses which could adversely impact our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

• the need to incur additional restructuring charges to optimize our cost structure 

to the extent the covid19 pandemic or a future outbreak adversely affects our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows it may also heighten many of the other risks described in this section the ultimate impact of covid19 as well as future outbreaks of infectious diseases on our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows is dependent on future developments including the duration of the pandemic and the related length of its impact on the global economy which are uncertain and cannot be predicted at this time 

business risks 

the sales of many of our products are dependent on the health of the vehicle repair market and the changing requirements of vehicle repair 

we believe sales of many of our products are dependent on the changing vehicle repair requirements the number of vehicles on the road the general aging of vehicles and the number of miles driven these factors affect the frequency type and amount of service and repair performed on vehicles by technicians and therefore affect the demand for the number of technicians the prosperity of technicians and consequently the demand technicians have for our tools other products and services as well as the value technicians place on those products and services the use of other methods of transportation including more frequent use of public transportation in the future could result in a decrease in the use of privately operated vehicles a decrease in the use of privately operated vehicles may lead to fewer repairs and less demand for our products 

the performance of snapon’s mobile tool distribution business depends on the success of its franchisees 

approximately 42 of our consolidated net revenues in 2020 were generated by the snapon tools group which consists of snapon’s business operations primarily serving vehicle service and repair technicians through the company’s worldwide mobile tool distribution channel snapon’s success is dependent on its relationships with franchisees individually and collectively as they are the primary sales and service link between the company and vehicle service and repair technicians who are an important class of end users for snapon’s products and services 

if our franchisees are not successful or if we do not maintain an effective relationship with our franchisees the delivery of products the collection of receivables andor our relationship with end users could be adversely affected and thereby negatively impact our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

in addition if we are unable to maintain effective relationships with franchisees snapon or the franchisees may choose to terminate the relationship which may result in i open routes in which enduser customers are not provided reliable service ii litigation resulting from termination iii reduced collections or increased chargeoffs of franchisee receivables owed to snapon andor iv reduced collections or increased chargeoffs of finance and contract receivables 





the inability to continue to introduce new products that respond to customer needs and achieve market acceptance could result in lower revenues and reduced profitability 

sales from new products represent a significant portion of our net sales and are expected to continue to represent a significant component of our future net sales we may not be able to compete effectively unless we continue to enhance existing products or introduce new products to the marketplace in a timely manner product improvements and new product introductions require significant financial and other resources including significant planning design development and testing at the technological product and manufacturing process levels our competitors’ new products may beat our products to market be more effective contain more features be less expensive than our products andor render our products obsolete any new products that we develop may not receive market acceptance or otherwise generate any meaningful net sales or profits for us relative to our expectations based on among other things existing and anticipated investments in manufacturing capacity and commitments to fund advertising marketing promotional programs and research and development 

failure to adequately protect intellectual property or claims of infringement could adversely affect our business reputation financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

intellectual property rights are an important and integral component of our business and failure to obtain or maintain adequate protection of our intellectual property rights for any reason could have a material adverse effect on our business we attempt to protect our intellectual property rights through a combination of patent trademark copyright and trade secret laws as well as licensing agreements and thirdparty nondisclosure and assignment agreements in addition we have been and in the future may be subject to claims of intellectual property infringement against us by third parties whether or not these claims have merit we could be required to expend significant resources in defense of those claims adverse determinations in a judicial or administrative proceeding or via a settlement could prevent us from manufacturing and selling our products prevent us from stopping others from manufacturing and selling competing products andor result in payments for damages in the event of an infringement claim we may also be required to spend significant resources to develop alternatives or obtain licenses which may not be available on reasonable terms or at all and may reduce our sales and disrupt our production failure to obtain or maintain adequate protection of our intellectual property rights for any reason could have a material adverse effect on our business 

the global tool equipment and diagnostics and repair information industries are competitive 

we face strong competition in all of our market segments price competition in our various industries is intense and pricing pressures from competitors and customers continue to increase in general as a manufacturer and marketer of premium products and services the expectations of snapon’s customers and its franchisees are high and continue to increase any inability to maintain customer satisfaction could diminish snapon’s premium image and reputation and could result in a lessening of our ability to command premium pricing we expect that the level of competition will remain high in the future which could limit our ability to maintain or increase market share or profitability 

foreign operations are subject to political economic and other risks that could adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

approximately 30 of our revenues in 2020 were generated outside of the united states future growth rates and success of our business depends in large part on continued growth in our nonus operations including growth in emerging markets and critical industries numerous risks and uncertainties affect our nonus operations these risks and uncertainties include political economic and social instability such as acts of war civil disturbance or acts of terrorism local labor conditions trade relations with china changes in government policies and regulations including imposition or increases in withholding and other taxes on remittances and other payments by international subsidiaries as well as exposure to liabilities under antibribery and anticorruption laws in various countries such as the us foreign corrupt practices act currency volatility transportation delays or interruptions sovereign debt uncertainties and difficulties in enforcement of contract and intellectual property rights reputational risks related to among other factors different standards and practices among countries as well as natural disasters and outbreaks of infectious diseases should the economic environment in our nonus markets deteriorate from current levels our results of operations and financial position could be materially impacted including as a result of the effects of potential impairment writedowns of goodwill andor other intangible assets related to these businesses 





the united kingdom “uk” formally left the european union “brexit” on january 31 2020 and was in a transition period until december 31 2020 the uk and the european union reached an agreement regarding brexit on december 24 2020 as part of the agreement there will be a new series of customs and regulatory checks including rules of origin and stringent local content requirements there will also be restrictions on the free movement of people and temporary visas for workrelated purposes are being reintroduced the implications of brexit or how such implications are expected to affect snapon continue to be reviewed by the company in addition to disruptions to trade and the movement of goods services and people between the uk and the european union or other countries brexit among other impacts could lead to additional cost delays and volatility in currency exchange rates as well as create legal and global economic uncertainty these and other potential implications could adversely affect our business and results of operations 

operational risks 

risks associated with the disruption of manufacturing operations could adversely affect our profitability or competitive position 

we manufacture a significant portion of the products we sell any prolonged disruption in the operations of our existing manufacturing facilities whether due to technical or labor difficulties facility consolidation or closure actions lack of raw material or component availability destruction of or damage to any facility as a result of natural disasters weather events use and storage of hazardous materials acts of war sabotage or terrorism civil unrest or other events or other reasons including outbreaks of infectious diseases such as the current covid19 pandemic could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

price fluctuations and shortages of raw materials components certain finished goods inventory and energy sources could adversely affect the ability to obtain needed materials or products and could adversely affect our results of operations 

the principal raw material used in the manufacture of our products is steel which we purchase in competitive pricesensitive markets to meet snapon’s high quality standards our steel needs range from specialized alloys which are available only from a limited group of approved suppliers to common alloys which are available from multiple suppliers some of these materials have been and in the future may be in short supply particularly in the event of mill shutdowns or production cut backs in addition outbreaks of infectious diseases weather events or other circumstances beyond our control could also impact the availability of raw materials as some steel alloys require specialized manufacturing procedures we could experience inventory shortages if we were required to use an alternative manufacturer on short notice these and other raw materials components and certain finished goods inventory can exhibit price and demand cyclicality including as a result of tariffs and other trade protection measures associated unexpected price increases could result in an erosion of product margins or require snapon to increase prices to customers to maintain margins 

we use various energy sources to transport produce and distribute products and some of our products have components that are petroleum based petroleum and energy prices have periodically increased significantly over short periods of time future volatility and changes may be caused by market fluctuations supply and demand currency fluctuations production and transportation disruptions world events and changes in governmental programs energy price increases raise both our operating costs and the costs of our materials and we may not be able to increase our prices enough to offset these costs higher prices also may reduce the level of future customer orders and our profitability 

failure to maintain effective distribution of products and services could adversely impact revenue gross margin and profitability 

we use a variety of distribution methods to sell our products and services successfully managing the interaction of our distribution efforts to reach various potential customer segments for our products and services is a complex process moreover since each distribution method has distinct risks costs and gross margins our failure to implement the most advantageous balance in the delivery model for our products and services could adversely affect our revenue gross margins and profitability 





data security and information technology infrastructure and security are critical to supporting business objectives failure of our systems to operate effectively could adversely affect our business and reputation 

we depend heavily on information technology infrastructure to achieve our business objectives and to protect sensitive information and continually invest in improving such systems problems that impair or compromise this infrastructure including natural disasters power outages major network failures security breaches or malicious attacks or during system upgrades andor new system implementations could impede our ability to record or process orders manufacture and ship in a timely manner manage our financial services operations including originating processing accounting for and collecting receivables protect sensitive data of the company our customers our suppliers and business partners or otherwise carry on business in the normal course any such events if significant could cause us to lose customers andor revenue and could require us to incur significant expense to remediate including as a result of legal or regulatory claims proceedings fines or penalties and could also damage our reputation while we have taken steps to maintain adequate data security and address these risks and uncertainties by implementing security technologies internal controls network and data center resiliency and redundancy and recovery processes as well as by securing insurance these measures may be inadequate these risks may be heightened as greater numbers of associates work remotely in response to safety measures adopted to address the covid19 pandemic 

in association with initiatives to better integrate business units rationalize our operating footprint and improve responsiveness to franchisees and customers snapon is continually enhancing its global enterprise resource planning erp management information systems as we integrate implement and deploy new information technology processes and enhance our information infrastructure across our global operations we could experience disruptions in our business that could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

failure to attract retain and effectively manage qualified personnel could lead to a loss of revenue andor profitability 

snapon’s success depends in part on the efforts and abilities of its senior management team and other key employees their skills experience and industry contacts significantly benefit our operations and administration the failure to attract and retain members of our senior management team and other key employees to effectively develop personnel and to execute succession plans could have a negative effect on our operating results in addition transitions of important responsibilities to new individuals inherently include the possibility of disruptions to our business and operations which could negatively affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we may not successfully integrate businesses we acquire which could have an adverse impact on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

the pursuit of growth through acquisitions including participation in joint ventures involves significant risks that could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows these risks include 

• loss of the acquired businesses’ customers 

• inability to integrate successfully the acquired businesses’ operations 

• inability to coordinate management and integrate and retain employees of the acquired businesses 

• unforeseen or contingent liabilities of the acquired businesses 

• large writeoffs or writedowns or the impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets 

• difficulties in implementing and maintaining consistent standards controls procedures policies and information systems 

• failure to realize anticipated synergies economies of scale or other anticipated benefits or to maintain operating margins 

• strain on our personnel systems and resources and diversion of attention from other priorities 

• incurrence of additional debt and related interest expense and 

• the dilutive effect in the event of the issuance of additional equity securities 





the steps taken to restructure operations rationalize operating footprint lower operating expenses and achieve greater efficiencies in the supply chain could disrupt business 

we have taken steps in the past and expect to take additional steps in the future intended to improve customer service and drive further efficiencies as well as reduce costs some of which could be disruptive to our business or adversely impact our results in certain periods these actions collectively across our operating groups are focused on the following 

• continuing to invest in initiatives focused on building a strong sales and operating presence in emerging growth markets 

• continuing to enhance service and value to our franchisees and customers 

• continuing to implement productivity initiatives throughout the company to drive further efficiencies and reduce energy and other operating costs 

• continuing on the company’s existing path to improve and transform global manufacturing and the supply chain into a marketdemandbased replenishment system with lower costs 

• continuing to invest in developing and marketing new innovative highervalueadded products and advanced technologies 

• extending our products and services into additional andor adjacent markets or to new customers and 

• continuing to provide financing for and grow our portfolio of receivables within our financial services businesses 

a failure to succeed in the implementation of any or all of these actions could result in an inability to achieve our financial goals and could be disruptive to the business 

in addition any future reductions to headcount and other cost reduction measures may result in the loss of technical expertise and could adversely affect our research and development efforts as well as our ability to meet product development schedules efforts to reduce components of expense could result in the recording of charges for inventory and technologyrelated writeoffs workforce reduction costs or other charges relating to the consolidation or closure of facilities if we were to incur a substantial charge to further these efforts or are unable to effectively manage our cost reduction and restructuring efforts our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected 

financial risks 

our inability to provide acceptable financing alternatives to franchisees and other enduser customers could adversely impact our operating results 

an integral component of our business and profitability is our ability to offer competitive financing alternatives to franchisees and other enduser customers the lack of our ability to offer such alternatives or obtain capital resources or other financing to support our receivables on terms that we believe are attractive whether resulting from the state of the financial markets our own operating performance or other factors would negatively affect our operating results and financial condition adverse fluctuations in interest rates andor our ability to provide competitive financing programs could also have an adverse impact on our revenue and profitability 

exposure to credit risks of customers and resellers may make it difficult to collect receivables and our allowances for credit losses for receivables may prove inadequate which could adversely affect operating results and financial condition 

a decline in industry andor economic conditions could have the potential to weaken the financial position of some of our customers including financial services customers if circumstances surrounding our customers’ ability to repay their credit obligations were to deteriorate and result in the writedown or writeoff of such receivables it would negatively affect our operating results for the relevant period and if large could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

the company maintains allowances for credit losses for receivables to provide for defaults and nonperformance these allowances represent an estimate of losses over the remaining contractual lives of our receivables which include current market conditions and estimates for reasonable and supportable forecasts when appropriate the determination of the appropriate levels of the allowances for credit losses involves a high degree of subjectivity and judgement and requires the company to make estimates of credit risks which may undergo material changes as a result of economic conditions and other factors the company’s allowances may not be adequate to cover actual losses and future allowances for credit losses could materially and adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 





foreign operations are subject to currency exchange inflation interest and other risks that could adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

the reporting currency for snapon’s consolidated financial statements is the us dollar certain of the company’s assets liabilities expenses and revenues are denominated in currencies other than the us dollar in preparing snapon’s consolidated financial statements those assets liabilities expenses and revenues are translated into us dollars at applicable exchange rates increases or decreases in exchange rates between the us dollar and other currencies affect the us dollar value of those items as reflected in the consolidated financial statements substantial fluctuations in the value of the us dollar or other transactional currencies could have a significant impact on the company’s financial condition and results of operations 

we are also affected by changes in inflation rates and interest rates additionally cash generated in certain nonus jurisdictions may be difficult to repatriate to the united states in a taxefficient manner our foreign operations are also subject to other risks and challenges such as the need to staff and manage diverse workforces respond to the needs of multiple national and international marketplaces and differing business climates and cultures in various countries 

adverse developments in the credit and financial markets could negatively impact the availability of credit that we and our customers need to operate our businesses 

we depend upon the availability of credit to operate our business including the financing of receivables from enduser customers that are originated by our financial services businesses our enduser customers franchisees and suppliers also require access to credit for their businesses at times world financial markets have been unstable and subject to uncertainty such as during the covid19 pandemic in 2020 adverse developments in the credit and financial markets or unfavorable changes in snapon’s credit rating could negatively impact the availability of future financing and the terms on which it might be available to snapon its enduser customers franchisees and suppliers inability to access credit or capital markets or a deterioration in the terms on which financing might be available could have an adverse impact on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

increasing our financial leverage could affect our operations and profitability 

the maximum available credit under our multicurrency revolving credit facility is 800 million the company’s leverage ratio may affect both our availability of additional capital resources as well as our operations in several ways including 

• the terms on which credit may be available to us could be less attractive both in the economic terms of the credit and the covenants stipulated by the credit terms 

• the possible lack of availability of additional credit or access to the commercial paper market 

• the potential for higher levels of interest expense to service or maintain our outstanding debt 

• the possibility of additional borrowings in the future to repay our indebtedness when it comes due and 

• the possible diversion of capital resources from other uses 

while we believe we will have the ability to service our debt and obtain additional resources in the future if and when needed that will depend upon our results of operations and financial position at the time the thencurrent state of the credit and financial markets and other factors that may be beyond our control therefore we cannot give assurances that credit will be available on terms that we consider attractive or at all if and when necessary or beneficial to us 

furthermore a portion of our indebtedness bears interest at rates that fluctuate with changes in certain shortterm prevailing interest rates including the london interbank offer rate “libor” although we attempt to manage our exposure to rate fluctuations via hedging arrangements such arrangements may be ineffective or may not protect us to the extent we expect in addition the united kingdom’s financial conduct authority announced that after 2021 it would no longer persuade or compel panel banks to submit the rates required to calculate libor and it is unclear whether the banks currently reporting information used to set libor will stop doing so after 2021 the united states “us” federal reserve in conjunction with the alternative reference rates committee a steering committee composed of large us financial institutions is considering replacing the us dollar libor with a new index the secured overnight financing rate “sofr” calculated using shortterm repurchase agreements backed by treasury securities although the consequences of these developments cannot be predicted at this time the rates under our variable rate indebtedness could increase and access to capital could be limited 





failure to achieve expected investment returns on pension plan assets as well as changes in interest rates or plan demographics could adversely impact our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

snapon sponsors various defined benefit pension plans the “pension plans” the assets of the pension plans are diversified in an attempt to mitigate the risk of a large loss required funding for the company’s domestic defined benefit pension plans is determined in accordance with guidelines set forth in the federal employee retirement income security act “erisa” foreign defined benefit pension plans are funded in accordance with local statutes or practice additional contributions to enhance the funded status of the pension plans can be made at the company’s discretion however there can be no assurance that the value of the pension plan assets or the investment returns on those plan assets will be sufficient to meet the future benefit obligations of such plans in addition during periods of adverse investment market conditions and declining interest rates the company may be required to make additional cash contributions to the pension plans that could reduce our financial flexibility changes in plan demographics including an increase in the number of retirements or changes in life expectancy assumptions may also increase the costs and funding requirements of the obligations related to the company’s pension plans 

our pension plan obligations are affected by changes in market interest rates significant fluctuations in market interest rates have added and may further add volatility to our pension plan obligations in periods of declining market interest rates our pension plan obligations generally increase in periods of increasing market interest rates our pension plan obligations generally decrease while our plan assets are broadly diversified there are inherent market risks associated with investments if adverse market conditions occur our plan assets could incur significant or material losses since we may need to make additional contributions to address changes in obligations andor a loss in plan assets the combination of declining market interest rates past or future plan asset investment losses andor changes in plan demographics could adversely impact our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

the company’s pension plan expense is comprised of the following factors i service cost ii interest on projected benefit obligations iii expected return on plan assets iv the amortization of prior service costs and credits v effects of actuarial gains and losses and vi settlementcurtailment costs when applicable the accounting for pensions involves the estimation of a number of factors that are highly uncertain certain factors such as the interest on projected benefit obligations and the expected return on plan assets are impacted by changes in market interest rates and the value of plan assets a significant decrease in market interest rates and a decrease in the fair value of plan assets would increase net pension expense and may adversely affect the company’s future results of operations see note 12 to the consolidated financial statements for further information on the company’s pension plans 

the recognition of impairment charges on goodwill or other intangible assets would adversely impact our future financial condition and results of operations 

we have a substantial amount of goodwill and purchased intangible assets almost all of which are booked in the commercial  industrial group and in the repair systems  information group we are required to perform impairment tests on our goodwill and other intangibles annually or at any time when events occur that could impact the value of our business segments our determination of whether impairment has occurred is based on a comparison of each of our reporting units’ fair market value with its carrying value 

significant and unanticipated changes in circumstances such as significant and longterm adverse changes in business climate adverse actions by regulators unanticipated competition the loss of key customers andor changes in technology or markets could require a provision for impairment in a future period that could substantially impact our reported earnings and reduce our consolidated net worth and shareholders’ equity should the economic environment in these markets deteriorate our results of operations and financial position could be materially impacted including as a result of the effects of potential impairment writedowns of goodwill andor other intangible assets related to these businesses 





legal and regulatory risks 

legislation and regulations relating to our business and the countries where we operate as well as any changes to such legislation or regulations in addition to new compliance obligations or a failure to maintain existing compliance requirements may if significant affect our business reputation results of operations and financial condition 

significant changes to legislative and regulatory activity and compliance burdens including those associated with i sales to our government military and defense contractor customers and ii classification of third parties including our franchisees as independent from the company as well as the manner in which they are applied could significantly impact our business and the economy as a whole 

financial services businesses of all kinds are subject to significant and complex regulations and enforcement in addition to potentially increasing the costs and other requirements of doing business due to compliance obligations new laws and regulations or changes to existing laws and regulations as well as the enforcement thereof may affect the relationships between creditors and debtors inhibit the rights of creditors to collect amounts owed to them expand liability for certain actions or inaction or limit the types of financial products or services offered any or all of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows failure to comply with any of these laws or regulations could also result in civil criminal monetary andor nonmonetary penalties damage to our reputation andor the incurrence of remediation costs 

these developments and other potential future legislation and regulations including the increasing global regulation of privacy rights may also adversely affect the customers to which and the markets into which we sell our products and increase our costs and otherwise negatively affect our business reputation results of operations and financial condition including in ways that cannot yet be foreseen 

product liability claims and litigation could affect our business reputation financial condition results of operations and cash flows

nongaap measures 

references in this management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations to “organic sales” refer to sales from continuing operations calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america “gaap” excluding acquisitionrelated sales and the impact of foreign currency translation management evaluates the company’s sales performance based on organic sales growth which primarily reflects growth from the company’s existing businesses as a result of increased output customer base and geographic expansion new product development andor pricing and excludes sales contributions from acquired operations the company did not own as of the comparable prioryear reporting period the company’s organic sales disclosures also exclude the effects of foreign currency translation as foreign currency translation is subject to volatility that can obscure underlying business trends management believes that the nongaap financial measure of organic sales is meaningful to investors as it provides them with useful information to aid in identifying underlying growth trends in our businesses and facilitating comparisons of our sales performance with prior periods 

fiscal year 

snapon’s fiscal year ends on the saturday that is on or nearest to december 31 unless otherwise indicated references in this document to “fiscal 2020” or “2020” refer to the fiscal year ended january 2 2021 references to “fiscal 2019” or “2019” refer to the fiscal year ended december 28 2019 and references to “fiscal 2018” or “2018” refer to the fiscal year ended december 29 2018 references in this document to 2020 2019 and 2018 year end refer to january 2 2021 december 28 2019 and december 29 2018 respectively 

snapon’s 2020 fiscal year contained 53 weeks of operating results with the extra week occurring in the fourth quarter snapon’s 2019 and 2018 fiscal years each contained 52 weeks of operating results the impact of the additional week of operations in fiscal 2020 was not material to snapon’s full year or fourth quarter total revenues or net earnings 





impact of covid19 

as discussed in part i item 1a risk factors the company faces risks related to outbreaks of infectious diseases including the ongoing covid19 pandemic which caused disruption and volatility in the global capital markets and authored an economic slowdown in response to covid19 national and local governments around the world instituted certain measures including travel bans prohibitions on group events and gatherings shutdowns of certain businesses curfews shelterinplace orders and recommendations to practice social distancing the challenges posed by the covid19 pandemic on the global economy increased significantly in the first quarter of 2020 impacting snapon’s sales volumes in most geographies and across a variety of customers including those in automotive repair in addition the impact of economic uncertainty caused by covid19 led to an increase in the credit reserve requirements for the company’s financial services portfolio 

during the second quarter of 2020 the covid19 pandemic and associated government measures to limit the spread of the virus heavily impacted snapon’s sales and earnings and as anticipated resulted in substantially lower performance in that period as compared to 2019 the company accommodated its operations to the virus environment continuing without significant disruption to serve its franchisees and other professional customers as they performed essential work while taking what it believes to be appropriate measures to ensure the health and safety of its personnel snapon also provided direct assistance to its franchisees as they accommodated the turbulence caused by the virus to enable continued service to their essential technician customers as a result of these accommodations the impact of the virus on operations lessened as the year progressed 

the company has invested in offsetting the virus impact including absorbing temporary closures of certain facilities wages for quarantined associates event cancellation fees as well as other related costs collectively “direct covid19related costs” or “direct costs associated with covid19” snapon has generally maintained its headcount manufacturing capacity and product development in anticipation of the return to precovid19 demand levels the company’s supply chain and distribution channels have not been materially impacted by the pandemic and the company has taken steps to ensure access to raw materials and components but it cannot provide assurances with respect to the future due to the evolving nature of the pandemic 

the ultimate impact of covid19 on our b usiness results of operations financial condition and cash flows is dependent on future developments including the duration of the pandemic and the related length of its impact on the global economy which are uncertain and cannot be predicted at this time

offbalancesheet arrangements 

except as included below in the section labeled “contractual obligations and commitments” and note 16 to the consolidated financial statements the company had no offbalancesheet arrangements as of 2020 year end 

contractual obligations and commitments 

a summary of snapon’s future contractual obligations and commitments as of 2020 year end are as follows 



snapon intends to make contributions of 92 million to its foreign pension plans and 22 million to its domestic pension plans in 2021 as required by law depending on market and other conditions snapon may make additional discretionary cash contributions to its pension plans in 2021 snapon has not presented estimated pension and postretirement funding contributions in the table above as the funding can vary from year to year based on changes in the fair value of the plan assets and actuarial assumptions see note 12 and note 13 to the consolidated financial statements for information on the company’s benefit plans and payments 

due to the uncertainty of the timing of settlements with taxing authorities snapon is unable to make reasonably reliable estimates of the period of cash settlement of unrecognized tax benefits for its remaining uncertain tax liabilities as a result 91 million of unrecognized tax benefits have been excluded from the table above see note 9 to the consolidated financial statements for information on income taxes 

environmental matters 

snapon is subject to various federal state and local government requirements regulating the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment snapon’s policy is to comply with these requirements and the company believes that as a general matter its policies practices and procedures are properly designed to prevent unreasonable risk of environmental damage and of resulting financial liability in connection with its business some risk of environmental damage is however inherent in some of snapon’s operations and products as it is with other companies engaged in similar businesses 

snapon is and has been engaged in the handling manufacture use and disposal of many substances classified as hazardous or toxic by one or more regulatory agencies snapon believes that as a general matter its handling manufacture use and disposal of these substances are in accordance with environmental laws and regulations it is possible however that future knowledge or other developments such as improved capability to detect substances in the environment or increasingly strict environmental laws and standards and enforcement policies could bring into question the company’s handling manufacture use or disposal of these substances 

new accounting standards 

see note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for information on new accounting standards 





critical accounting policies and estimates 

the consolidated financial statements and related notes contain information that is pertinent to management’s discussion and analysis the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america “gaap” requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period these estimates are generally based on historical experience current conditions and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily available from other sources as well as identifying and assessing our accounting treatment with respect to commitments and contingencies actual results could differ from those estimates 

in addition to the company’s significant accounting policies described in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements snapon considers the following policies and estimates to be the most critical in understanding the judgments that are involved in the preparation of the company’s consolidated financial statements and the uncertainties that could impact the company’s financial position results of operations and cash flows 

allowance for credit losses on finance receivables the allowance for credit losses on finance receivables is maintained at a level management believes is adequate to cover expected losses in snapon’s finance receivables portfolio as of the reporting date the allowance represents management’s estimate of the expected losses in the company’s finance receivables portfolio based on ongoing assessments and evaluations of credit losses over the expected contractual life of the receivables portfolio considering collectability historical loss experience current conditions and future market changes determination of the proper level of allowance requires management to exercise judgment about the timing frequency and severity of credit losses that could materially affect the expense for credit losses and as a result net earnings the allowance takes into consideration numerous quantitative and qualitative factors that include receivable type historical loss experience delinquency trends collection experience current and future economic conditions and credit risk characteristics some of these factors are influenced by items such as the customers’ financial condition past payment experience credit bureau and proprietary snapon credit model information as well as the value of the underlying collateral changes in economic conditions and assumptions including the resulting credit quality metrics relative to the performance of the finance receivables portfolio create uncertainty and could result in changes to both the allowance for credit losses and expense for credit losses 

management utilizes established policies and procedures in an effort to ensure the estimates and assumptions are well controlled reviewed and consistently applied as of january 2 2021 the ratio of the allowance for credit losses to finance receivables was 438 in 2020 financial services expenses included higher provisions for credit losses related to the company’s adoption of asu no 201613 financial instruments  credit losses topic 326  as of december 28 2019 the allowance ratio was 365 while management believes it exercises prudent judgment and applies reasonable assumptions in establishing its estimates for allowances for finance receivables there can be no assurance that changes in economic conditions or other factors would not adversely impact the financial health of our customers and result in changes to the estimates used in the allowance calculation for reference a 100 bps increase in the allowance ratios for finance receivables as of january 2 2021 would have increased snapon’s 2020 expense for credit losses and related allowance for credit losses by approximately 175 million 

for additional information on snapon’s allowances for credit losses see note 1 and note 4 to the consolidated financial statements 

impairment of goodwill goodwill is tested for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the assets might be impaired annual impairment tests are performed by the company in the second quarter of each year using information available as of april month end 

snapon evaluates the recoverability of goodwill by estimating the future discounted cash flows of the businesses to which the goodwill relates estimated cash flows and related goodwill are grouped at the reporting unit level the company has determined that its reporting units for testing goodwill impairment are its operating segments or components of an operating segment that constitute a business for which discrete financial information is available and for which segment management regularly reviews the operating results within its four reportable operating segments the company has identified 11 reporting units 





snapon evaluates the recoverability of goodwill by utilizing an income approach that estimates the fair value of the future discounted cash flows of the reporting units to which the goodwill relates the future projections which are based on both past performance and the projections and assumptions used in the company’s operating plans are subject to change as a result of changing economic and competitive conditions this approach reflects management’s internal outlook at the reporting units which management believes provides the best determination of value due to management’s insight and experience with the reporting units significant estimates used by management in the discounted cash flows methodology include estimates of future cash flows based on expected growth rates price increases working capital levels expected benefits from rci initiatives and a weightedaverage cost of capital that reflects the specific risk profile of the reporting unit being tested the company’s methodologies for valuing goodwill are applied consistently on a yearoveryear basis the assumptions used in performing the second quarter 2020 impairment calculations were evaluated in light of thencurrent market and business conditions snapon continues to believe that the future discounted cash flow valuation model provides the most reasonable and meaningful fair value estimate based upon the reporting units’ projections of future operating results and cash flows and replicates how market participants would value the company’s reporting units in an orderly transaction 

in the event the fair value of a reporting unit is less than the carrying value including goodwill the company would then record an impairment charge based on the excess of a reporting units carrying amount over its fair value 

inherent in fair value determinations are significant judgments and estimates including material assumptions about future revenue profitability and cash flows the company’s operational plans and its interpretation of current economic indicators should the operations of the businesses with which goodwill is associated incur significant declines in profitability and cash flow due to significant and longterm deterioration in macroeconomic industry and market conditions the loss of key customers changes in technology or markets significant changes in key personnel or litigation a significant and sustained decrease in share price andor other events including effects from the sale or disposal of a reporting unit some or all of the recorded goodwill could be subject to impairment and could result in a material adverse effect on snapon’s financial position or results of operations 

snapon completed its annual impairment testing of goodwill in the second quarter of 2020 which did not result in any impairment as of 2020 year end the company has no accumulated impairment losses although the company consistently uses the same methods in developing the assumptions and estimates underlying the fair value calculations such estimates are uncertain by nature and can vary from actual results in performing its annual impairment testing the company performed a sensitivity analysis on the material assumptions used in the discounted cash flow valuation models for each of its 11 reporting units based on the company’s second quarter 2020 impairment testing and assuming a hypothetical 10 decrease in the estimated fair values of each of its 11 reporting units the hypothetical fair value of each of the company’s 11 reporting units would have been greater than its carrying value see note 7 to the consolidated financial statements for further information about goodwill 

pension benefits the pension benefit obligation and related pension expense are calculated in accordance with gaap and are impacted by certain actuarial assumptions changes in these assumptions are primarily influenced by factors outside of snapon’s control such as changes in economic conditions and can have a significant effect on the amounts reported in the financial statements snapon believes that the two most critical assumptions are i the expected return on plan assets and ii the assumed discount rate 

snapon’s domestic pension plans have a longterm investment horizon and a total return strategy that emphasizes a capital growth objective in 2020 the longterm investment performance objective for snapon’s domestic plans’ assets was to achieve net of expense returns that met or exceeded the 725 domestic expected return on plan assets assumption snapon uses a threeyear marketrelated value asset method of amortizing the difference between actual and expected returns on its domestic plans’ assets as of 2020 year end snapon’s domestic pension plans’ assets comprised approximately 86 of the company’s worldwide pension plan assets 

based on forwardlooking capital market expectations snapon selected an expected return on plan assets assumption for its us pension plans of 675 a decrease of 50 bps from 2020 to be used in determining pension expense for 2021 in estimating the domestic expected return on plan assets snapon utilizes a nominal returns forecasting method for each asset class future returns are estimated by identifying the premium of riskier asset classes over lower risk alternatives the methodology constructs expected returns using a “building block” approach to the individual components of total return these forecasts are stated in both nominal and real after inflation terms this process first considers the longterm historical return premium based on the longest set of data available for each asset class these premiums calculated using the geometric mean are then adjusted based on current relative valuation levels macroeconomic conditions and the expected alpha related to active investment management the asset return assumption is also adjusted by an implicit expense load for estimated administrative and investmentrelated expenses since asset allocation is a key determinant of expected investment returns the current and expected mix of plan assets are also considered when setting the assumption 





pension expense increases as the expected rate of return on plan assets decreases lowering the expected rate of return assumption for snapon’s domestic pension plans’ assets by 50 bps would have increased snapon’s 2020 domestic pension expense by approximately 59 million 

the objective of snapon’s discount rate assumption is to reflect the rate at which the pension benefits could be effectively settled in making this determination the company takes into account the timing and amount of benefits that would be available under the plans the domestic discount rate as of 2020 and 2019 year end was selected based on a cash flow matching methodology developed by the company’s outside actuaries and which incorporates a review of current economic conditions this methodology matches the plans’ yearly projected cash flows for benefits and service costs to those of hypothetical bond portfolios using highquality aa rated or better corporate bonds from either moody’s investors service or standard  poor’s credit rating agencies available at the measurement date this technique calculates bond portfolios that produce adequate cash flows to pay the plans’ projected yearly benefits and then selects the portfolio with the highest yield and uses that yield as the recommended discount rate 

the selection of the 27 weightedaverage discount rate for snapon’s domestic pension plans as of 2020 year end compared to 34 as of 2019 year end represents the single rate that produces the same present value of cash flows as the estimated benefit plan payments lowering snapon’s domestic discount rate assumption by 50 bps would have increased snapon’s 2020 domestic pension expense and projected benefit obligation by approximately 45 million and 824 million respectively as of 2020 year end snapon’s domestic projected benefit obligation comprised approximately 82 of snapon’s worldwide projected benefit obligation the weightedaverage discount rate for snapon’s foreign pension plans of 17 compared to 21 as of 2019 year end represents the single rate that produces the same present value of cash flows as the estimated benefit plan payments lowering snapon’s foreign discount rate assumption by 50 bps would have increased snapon’s 2020 foreign pension expense and projected benefit obligation by approximately 19 million and 323 million respectively 

actuarial gains and losses in excess of 10 percent of the greater of the projected benefit obligation or marketrelated value of assets are amortized on a straightline basis over the average remaining service period of active participants or over the average remaining life expectancy for plans with primarily inactive participants prior service costs and credits resulting from plan amendments are amortized in equal annual amounts over the average remaining service period of active participants or over the average remaining life expectancy for plans with primarily inactive participants 

to determine the 2021 net periodic benefit cost snapon is using weightedaverage discount rates for its domestic and foreign pension plans of 27 and 17 respectively and an expected return on plan assets for its domestic pension plans of 675 the expected returns on plan assets for foreign pension plans ranged from 10 to 54 as of 2020 year end due to the net change in these two key assumptions in addition to the overall benefit plan status pension expense in 2021 is expected to decrease other factors such as changes in plan demographics and discretionary contributions may further increase or decrease pension expense in 2021 see note 12 to the consolidated financial statements for further information on pension plans 

outlook 

covid19 spread across the globe during 2020 and continues to impact economic activity worldwide into 2021 snapon is accommodating to the related risks while safely pursuing opportunities in the covid19 environment in 2021 the company believes there will be ongoing advancements against the virusrelated turbulence and that the trajectory of progress may be uncertain due to the evolving nature and duration of the pandemic 

snapon does expect to make continued progress in 2021 along its defined runways for coherent growth leveraging capabilities already demonstrated in the automotive repair arena and developing and expanding its professional customer base not only in automotive repair but in adjacent markets additional geographies and other areas including extending in critical industries where the cost and penalties for failure can be high in pursuit of these initiatives it is projected that capital expenditures in 2021 will be in a range of 90 million to 100 million snapon continues to respond to global macroeconomic challenges through its rci process and other cost reduction initiatives 

snapon currently anticipates that its full year 2021 effective income tax rate will be in the range of 23 to 24 








 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

market credit and economic risks 

market risk is the potential economic loss that may result from adverse changes in the fair value of financial instruments snapon is exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates snapon is also exposed to market risk associated with the stockbased portion of its deferred compensation plans snapon monitors its exposure to these risks and attempts to manage the underlying economic exposures through the use of financial instruments such as foreign currency forward contracts interest rate swap agreements treasury lock agreements and prepaid equity forward agreements “equity forwards” snapon does not use derivative instruments for speculative or trading purposes snapon’s broadbased business activities help to reduce the impact that volatility in any particular area or related areas may have on its operating earnings as a whole snapon’s management takes an active role in the risk management process and has developed policies and procedures that require specific administrative and business functions to assist in the identification assessment and control of various risks 

foreign currency risk management 

snapon has significant international operations and is subject to certain risks inherent with foreign operations that include currency fluctuations foreign currency exchange risk exists to the extent that snapon has payment obligations or receipts denominated in currencies other than the functional currency including intercompany loans denominated in foreign currencies to manage these exposures snapon identifies naturally offsetting positions and then purchases hedging instruments to protect the residual net exposures see note 11 to the consolidated financial statements for information on foreign currency risk management 

interest rate risk management 

snapon aims to control funding costs by managing the exposure created by the differing maturities and interest rate structures of snapon’s borrowings through the use of interest rate swap agreements treasury lock agreements are used from time to time to manage the potential change in interest rates in anticipation of the possible issuance of fixed rate debt see note 11 to the consolidated financial statements for information on interest rate risk management 

snapon utilizes a valueatrisk “var” model to determine the potential oneday loss in the fair value of its interest rate and foreign exchangesensitive financial instruments from adverse changes in market factors the var model estimates were made assuming normal market conditions and a 95 confidence level snapon’s computations are based on the interrelationships among movements in various currencies and interest rates variancecovariance technique these interrelationships were determined by observing interest rate and foreign currency market changes over the preceding quarter 

the estimated maximum potential oneday loss in fair value calculated using the var model as of 2020 and 2019 year end was 139 million and 99 million respectively on interest ratesensitive financial instruments and 01 million and 02 million respectively on foreign currencysensitive financial instruments the var model is a risk management tool and does not purport to represent actual losses in fair value that will be incurred by snapon nor does it consider the potential effect of favorable changes in market factors 

stockbased deferred compensation risk management 

snapon aims to manage market risk associated with the stockbased portion of its deferred compensation plans through the use of equity forwards equity forwards are used to aid in offsetting the potential marktomarket effect on stockbased deferred compensation from changes in snapon’s stock price since stockbased deferred compensation liabilities increase as the company’s stock price rises and decrease as the company’s stock price declines the equity forwards are intended to mitigate the potential impact on compensation expense that may result from such marktomarket changes see note 11 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on stockbased deferred compensation risk management 

credit risk 

credit risk is the possibility of loss from a customer’s failure to make payments according to contract terms prior to extending credit each customer is evaluated taking into consideration various factors including the customer’s financial condition debtservicing ability past payment experience credit bureau information and other financial and qualitative factors that may affect the customer’s ability to repay as well as the value of the underlying collateral finance receivable credit risk is also monitored regularly through the use of internal proprietary custom scoring models to evaluate each transaction at the time of the application for credit snapon evaluates credit quality through the use of an internal proprietary measuring system that provides a framework to analyze finance receivables on the basis of risk factors of the individual obligor as well as transaction specific risk the finance receivables are typically monitored through an asset quality review process that closely monitors past due accounts and initiates a progressive collection action process when appropriate 





counterparty risk 

snapon is exposed to credit losses in the event of nonperformance by the counterparties to its various financial agreements including its foreign currency forward contracts interest rate swap agreements treasury lock agreements and prepaid equity forward agreements snapon does not obtain collateral or other security to support financial instruments subject to credit risk but monitors the credit standing of the counterparties and generally enters into agreements with financial institution counterparties with a credit rating of a or better snapon does not anticipate nonperformance by its counterparties but cannot provide assurances 

economic risk 

economic risk is the possibility of loss resulting from economic instability in certain areas of the world snapon continually monitors its exposure in these markets for example the company is monitoring the impact of and developments related to the covid19 pandemic which has created global economic uncertainty in addition the company is monitoring the effects of the united kingdom’s exit from the european union although it is too soon to know what effects this might have on the world economy or the company inflation has not had a significant impact on the company 

as a result of the above market credit and economic risks net earnings and revenues in any particular period may not be representative of fullyear results and may vary significantly from year to year 

commodity risk 

snapon is a purchaser of certain commodities such as steel natural gas and electricity the company is also a purchaser of components and parts that are integrated into the company’s end products as well as the purchaser of certain finished goods all of which may contain various commodities including steel aluminum nickel copper and others snapon’s supply of raw materials and purchased components are generally and readily available from numerous suppliers 

the principal raw material used in the manufacture of the company’s products is steel which the company purchases in competitive pricesensitive markets to meet snapon’s high quality standards the company’s steel needs range from specialized alloys which are available only from a limited group of approved suppliers to common alloys which are available from multiple suppliers some of these materials have been and in the future may be in short supply particularly in the event of mill shutdowns or production cut backs as some steel alloys require specialized manufacturing procedures snapon could experience inventory shortages if it were required to use an alternative manufacturer on short notice steel and other raw materials components and certain finished goods inventory can exhibit price and demand cyclicality including as a result of tariffs and other trade protection measures associated unexpected price increases could result in an erosion of product margins or require snapon to increase prices to customers to maintain margins 

snapon believes its ability to sell product is also dependent on the changing vehicle repair requirements the number of vehicles on the road the general aging of vehicles and the number of miles driven these factors affect the frequency type and amount of service and repair performed on vehicles by technicians and therefore affect the demand for the number of technicians the prosperity of the technicians and consequently the demand technicians have for the company’s tools other products and services and the value technicians place on those products and services the use of other methods of transportation including more frequent use of public transportation could result in a decrease in the use of privately operated vehicles a decrease in the use of privately operated vehicles may lead to fewer repairs and less demand for the company’s products 

to the extent that commodity prices increase and the company does not have firm pricing agreements with its suppliers the company may experience margin declines to the extent that it is not able to increase the selling prices of its products

snapon offers financing through soc and the company’s international finance subsidiaries in most markets where snapon has franchise operations financing revenue from contract originations is recognized over the life of the underlying contracts with interest or finance charges computed primarily on the average daily balances of the underlying contracts 

sales and distribution 

snapon markets and distributes its products and related services principally to professional tool and equipment users around the world the two largest market sectors are the vehicle service and repair sector and the industrial sector 

vehicle service and repair sector 

the vehicle service and repair sector has three main customer groups i professional technicians who purchase tools and diagnostic and equipment products for use in their work ii other professional customers related to vehicle repair including owners and managers of independent repair shops and oem dealerships who purchase tools and diagnostic and equipment products for use by multiple technicians within a service or repair facility and iii oems 

snapon provides innovative tool equipment and business solutions as well as technical sales support and training designed to meet technicians’ evolving needs snapon’s mobile tool distribution system offers technicians the convenience of purchasing quality tools at their place of business with minimal disruption of their work routine snapon also provides owners and managers of repair shops where technicians work with tools diagnostic equipment and repair and service information including electronic parts catalogs and shop management products snapon’s oem facilitation business provides oems with products and services including special and essential tools as well as consulting and facilitation services which include product procurement distribution and administrative support to customers for their dealership equipment programs 

the vehicle service and repair sector is characterized by an increasing rate of technological change within motor vehicles vehicle population growth and increasing vehicle life and the resulting effects of these changes on the businesses of both our suppliers and customers snapon believes it is a meaningful participant in the vehicle service and repair market sector 

industrial sector 

snapon markets its products and services globally to a broad crosssection of commercial and industrial customers including maintenance and repair operations manufacturing and assembly facilities various government agencies facilities and operations including military operations schools with vocational and technical programs aviation and aerospace operations oil and gas developers mining operations energy and power generation operations equipment fabricators and operators railroad manufacturing and maintenance customers in agriculture infrastructure construction companies and other customers that require instrumentation service tools andor equipment for their products and business needs the industrial sector for snapon focuses on providing valueadded products and services to an increasingly expanding global base of customers in critical industries 

the industrial sector is characterized by a highly competitive environment with multiple suppliers offering either a full line or industry specific portfolios for tools and equipment industrial customers increasingly require specialized solutions that provide repeatability and reliability in performing tasks of consequence that are specific to the particular end market in which they operate snapon believes it is a meaningful participant in the industrial tools and equipment market sector 

  

distribution channels 

snapon serves customers primarily through the following channels of distribution i the mobile van channel ii company direct sales iii distributors and iv ecommerce the following discussion summarizes snapon’s general approach for each channel and is not intended to be allinclusive 





mobile van channel 

in the united states a significant portion of sales to the vehicle service and repair sector is conducted through snapon’s mobile franchise van channel snapon’s franchisees primarily serve vehicle repair technicians and vehicle service shop owners generally providing weekly contact at the customer’s place of business franchisees’ sales are concentrated in hand and power tools tool storage products shop equipment and diagnostic and repair information products which can be transported in a van or trailer and demonstrated during a sales call franchisees purchase snapon’s products at a discount from suggested list prices and resell them at prices established by the franchisee us franchisees are provided a list of calls that serves as the basis of the franchisee’s sales route snapon’s franchisees also have the opportunity to add a limited number of additional franchises 

snapon charges nominal initial and ongoing monthly franchise fees franchise fee revenue including nominal nonrefundable initial and ongoing monthly fees primarily for sales and business training and marketing and product promotion programs is recognized as the fees are earned franchise fee revenue totaled 154 million 162 million and 152 million in fiscal 2019 2018 and 2017 respectively 

snapon also has a companyowned route program that is designed to i provide another pool of potential field organization personnel ii service customers in select new andor open routes not currently serviced by franchisees and iii allow snapon to pilot new sales and promotional ideas prior to introducing them to franchisees as of 2019 year end companyowned routes comprised approximately 4 of the total route population snapon may elect to increase or reduce the number of companyowned routes in the future 

in addition to its mobile van channel in the united states snapon has replicated its us franchise distribution model in certain other countries including canada the united kingdom japan australia germany netherlands south africa new zealand belgium and ireland in many of these markets as in the united states purchase decisions are generally made or influenced by professional vehicle service technicians as well as repair shop owners and managers as of 2019 year end snapon’s worldwide route count was approximately 4800 including approximately 3450 routes in the united states 

through soc financing is available to us franchisees including financing for van leases working capital loans and loans to help enable new franchisees to fund the purchase of the franchise or the expansion of an existing franchise in many international markets snapon offers a variety of financing options to its franchisees andor customer networks through its international finance subsidiaries the decision to finance through snapon or another financing source is solely at the customer’s election 

snapon supports its franchisees with a field organization of regional offices franchise performance teams customer care centers and distribution centers snapon also provides sales and business training and marketing and product promotion programs as well as customer and franchisee financing programs through soc and the company’s international finance subsidiaries all of which are designed to strengthen franchisee sales national franchise advisory councils in the united states the united kingdom canada and australia composed primarily of franchisees that are elected by franchisees assist snapon in identifying and implementing enhancements to the franchise program 

company direct sales 

a significant proportion of shop equipment sales in north america under the john bean hofmann blackhawk caroliner challenger and procut brands diagnostic products under the snapon brand and information products under the mitchell1 brand are made by direct and independent sales forces that have responsibility for national and other accounts as the vehicle service and repair sector consolidates with more business conducted by national chains and franchised service centers snapon believes these larger organizations can be serviced most effectively by sales people who can demonstrate and sell the full line of diagnostic and equipment products and services snapon also sells these products and services directly to oems and their franchised dealers 

  

snapon brand tools and equipment are marketed to industrial and governmental customers worldwide through both industrial sales associates and independent distributors selling activities focus on industrial customers whose main purchase criteria are quality and integrated solutions as of 2019 year end snapon had industrial sales associates and independent distributors primarily in the united states canada and in various european latin american middle eastern asian and african countries with the united states representing the majority of snapon’s total industrial sales 

snapon also sells software services and solutions to the automotive commercial heavy duty agriculture power equipment and power sports segments products and services are marketed to targeted groups including oems and their dealerships fleets and individual repair shops to effectively reach oems which frequently have a multinational presence snapon has deployed focused business teams globally 





distributors 

sales of certain tools and equipment are made through independent distributors who purchase the items from snapon and resell them to end users hand tools sold under the bahco irimo lindström cdi ati fastorq norbar sioux sturtevant richmont and williams brands and trade names for example are sold through distributors worldwide wheel service and other vehicle service equipment are sold through distributors primarily under brands including hofmann john bean caroliner challenger procut cartec blackhawk and ecotechnics diagnostic and equipment products are marketed through distributors in south america and asia and through both a direct sales force and distributors in europe under the snapon sun and bluepoint brands 

ecommerce 

snapon offers current and prospective customers online access to research and purchase products through its public website at wwwsnaponcom  the site features an online catalog of snapon hand tools power tools tool storage units and diagnostic equipment available to customers in the united states the united kingdom canada and australia ecommerce and certain other system enhancement initiatives are designed to improve productivity and further leverage the oneonone relationships and service snapon has with its current and prospective customers sales through the company’s ecommerce distribution channel were not significant in any of the last three years 

competition 

snapon competes on the basis of its product quality and performance product line breadth and depth service brand awareness and imagery technological innovation and availability of financing through soc or its international finance subsidiaries while snapon does not believe that any single company competes with it across all of its product lines and distribution channels various companies compete in one or more product categories andor distribution channels 

snapon believes it is a leading manufacturer and distributor of professional tools tool storage diagnostic and equipment products and repair software and solutions offering a broad line of these products to both vehicle service and industrial marketplaces various competitors target and sell to professional technicians in the vehicle service and repair sector through the mobile tool distribution channel snapon also competes with companies that sell tools and equipment to vehicle service and repair technicians online and through retail stores vehicle parts supply outlets and tool supply warehousesdistributorships within the power tools category and the industrial sector snapon has various other competitors including companies with offerings that overlap with other areas discussed herein major competitors selling diagnostics shop equipment and information to vehicle dealerships and independent repair shops include oems and their proprietary electronic parts catalogs and diagnostics and information systems and other companies that offer products serving this sector 

raw materials and purchased product 

snapon’s supply of raw materials and purchased components are generally and readily available from numerous suppliers snapon believes it has secured an ample supply of both bar and coil steel for the near future to ensure stable supply to meet material demands the company does not currently anticipate experiencing any significant impact in 2020 from steel pricing or availability issues though it is continuing to monitor the impact of tariffs and other trade protection measures put in place by the us and other countries 

  

patents trademarks and other intellectual property 

snapon vigorously pursues and relies on patent protection to protect its intellectual property and position in its markets as of 2019 year end snapon and its subsidiaries held approximately 780 active and pending patents in the united states and approximately 2150 active and pending patents outside of the united states sales relating to any single patent did not represent a material portion of snapon’s revenues in any of the last three years 

examples of products that have features or designs that benefit from patent protection include hand tools including sealed ratchets and ratcheting screwdrivers power tools wheel alignment systems wheel balancers tire changers vehicle lifts tool storage tool control collision measurement test lanes brake lathes electronic torque instruments emissionssensing devices and diagnostic equipment 

much of the technology used in the manufacture of vehicle service tools and equipment is in the public domain snapon relies primarily on trade secret protection to protect proprietary processes used in manufacturing methods and processes are patented when appropriate copyright protection is also utilized when appropriate 





trademarks used by snapon are of continuing importance to snapon in the marketplace trademarks have been registered in the united states and many other countries and additional applications for trademark registrations are pending snapon vigorously polices proper use of its trademarks snapon’s right to manufacture and sell certain products is dependent upon licenses from others however these products under license do not represent a material portion of snapon’s net sales 

domain names have become a valuable corporate asset for companies around the world including snapon domain names often contain a trademark or service mark or even a corporate name and are often considered intellectual property the recognition and value of the snapon name trademark and domain name are core strengths of the company 

snapon strategically licenses the snapon brand to carefully selected manufacturing and distribution companies for items such as apparel and a variety of other goods in order to further build brand awareness and market presence for the company’s strongest brand 

environmental 

snapon is subject to various environmental laws ordinances regulations and other requirements of government authorities in the united states and other nations at snapon these environmental liabilities are managed through the snapon environmental health and safety management system “eh  sms” which is applied worldwide the system is based upon continual improvement and is certified to iso 140012015 and ohsas 180012007 verified through det norske veritas dnv certification inc 

snapon believes that it complies with applicable environmental control requirements in its operations expenditures on environmental matters through eh  sms have not had and snapon does not for the foreseeable future expect them to have a material effect upon snapon’s capital expenditures earnings or competitive position 

employees 

snapon employed approximately 12800 people at the end of january 2020 and 12600 people at the end of january 2019 the yearoveryear increase in employees reflects acquisitions during 2019 

approximately 2650 employees or 21 of snapon’s worldwide workforce are represented by unions andor covered under collective bargaining agreements the number of covered union employees whose contracts expire over the next five years approximates 1825 employees in 2020 650 employees in 2021 and 175 employees in 2022 there are no contracts currently scheduled to expire in 2023 or 2024 in recent years snapon has not experienced any significant work slowdowns stoppages or other labor disruptions 

there can be no assurance that these and other future contracts with snapon’s unions will be renegotiated upon terms acceptable to snapon 

  

working capital 

most of snapon’s businesses are not seasonal and their inventory needs are relatively constant snapon did not have a significant backlog of orders at 2019 year end in recent years snapon has been using its working capital to fund in part the growth of the company’s financial services portfolio increased inventory to support new product introductions and the acquisitions discussed above 

snapon’s liquidity and capital resources and use of working capital are discussed herein in “part ii item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” 

snapon does not have any single customer or government that represents 10 or more of its revenues in any of the indicated periods 





social responsibility 

snapon is committed to conducting business and making decisions honestly ethically fairly and within the law and is guided by the beliefs and values in the company’s “who we are” mission statement snapon is dedicated to earning and keeping the trust and confidence of its shareholders customers franchisees distributors and associates as well as of the communities where the company does business paramount to the company’s commitment to integrity and social responsibility is the manner in which snapon treats its employees and the way in which others within its supply chain treat their employees snapon has adopted policies that seek to eliminate human trafficking slavery forced labor and child labor from its global supply chain in addition snapon is committed to nonnegotiable product and workplace safety as a permanent and priority agenda item at all operational meetings safety comes first snapon strives to maintain a safe workplace and expects its employees to broadly embrace the company’s safety programs snapon invests in its strong safety culture and in elevating the importance of worker and product safety throughout all levels of the organization 




 item 1a risk factors 

in evaluating the company careful consideration should be given to the following risk factors in addition to the other information included in this annual report on form 10k including the consolidated financial statements and the related notes each of these risk factors could adversely affect the company’s business operating results cash flows andor financial condition as well as adversely affect the value of an investment in the company’s common stock 

economic conditions and world events could affect our operating results 

we our franchisees and our customers may be adversely affected by changing economic conditions including conditions that may particularly impact specific regions these conditions may result in reduced consumer and investor confidence instability in the credit and financial markets volatile corporate profits and reduced business and consumer spending we our franchisees and our customers and the economy as a whole also may be affected by future world or local events outside our control such as tariffs and other trade protection measures put in place by the united states or other countries acts of terrorism developments in the war on terrorism conflicts in international situations weather events and natural disasters outbreaks of infectious diseases as well as governmentrelated developments or issues these factors may affect our results of operations by reducing our sales margins andor net earnings as a result of a slowdown in customer orders or order cancellations impact the availability andor pricing of raw materials andor the supply chain and could potentially lead to future impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets in addition political and social turmoil related to international conflicts and terrorist acts may put pressure on economic conditions abroad unstable political social and economic conditions may make it difficult for our franchisees customers suppliers and us to accurately forecast and plan future business activities if such conditions persist our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows could be negatively affected 

in 2016 the united kingdom voted in a referendum to exit the european union “brexit” which resulted in significant currency exchange rate fluctuations and volatility the uk formally left the european union on january 31 2020 and is in a transition period that is currently scheduled to end on december 31 2020 the “transition period” during the transition period the uk essentially remains in the european union’s customs union and single market negotiations continue to determine the terms of brexit given the lack of comparable precedent and the status of the negotiations the implications of brexit or how such implications might affect snapon continue to remain unclear at this time brexit could among other impacts disrupt trade and the movement of goods services and people between the uk and the european union or other countries lead to additional volatility in currency exchange rates as well as create legal and global economic uncertainty these and other potential implications could adversely affect our business and results of operations 

in 2018 canada mexico and the united states negotiated the united statesmexicocanada agreement the “usmca” which is intended to update and replace the north american free trade agreement “nafta” the usmca must be ratified by all three countries before it becomes fully effective mexico and the us ratified the usmca in 2019 and january 2020 respectively however timing of the potential ratification of the usmca by canada is currently unknown while the usmca is somewhat similar to nafta it contains several new compliance obligations addressing such issues as rules of origin labor standard certificate of origin documentation and de minimis thresholds as well as new policies on labor and environmental standards intellectual property protections and some digital trade provisions snapon is currently analyzing the expected impact of the usmca while certain aspects of the usmca are expected to be positive others including potentially higher regulatory compliance costs may have an adverse impact on our business 

these and other matters significantly impacting the regulation of trade could adversely affect our business and results of operations 

  





price fluctuations and shortages of raw materials components certain finished goods inventory and energy sources could adversely affect the ability to obtain needed materials or products and could adversely affect our results of operations 

the principal raw material used in the manufacture of our products is steel which we purchase in competitive pricesensitive markets to meet snapon’s high quality standards our steel needs range from specialized alloys which are available only from a limited group of approved suppliers to common alloys which are available from multiple suppliers some of these materials have been and in the future may be in short supply particularly in the event of mill shutdowns or production cut backs as some steel alloys require specialized manufacturing procedures we could experience inventory shortages if we were required to use an alternative manufacturer on short notice these and other raw materials components and certain finished goods inventory can exhibit price and demand cyclicality including as a result of tariffs and other trade protection measures associated unexpected price increases could result in an erosion of the margins on our products or require us to pass higher prices on to our customers 

we use various energy sources to transport produce and distribute products and some of our products have components that are petroleum based petroleum and energy prices have periodically increased significantly over short periods of time future volatility and changes may be caused by market fluctuations supply and demand currency fluctuations production and transportation disruptions world events and changes in governmental programs energy price increases raise both our operating costs and the costs of our materials and we may not be able to increase our prices enough to offset these costs higher prices also may reduce the level of future customer orders and our profitability 

the performance of snapon’s mobile tool distribution business depends on the success of its franchisees and the health of the vehicle repair market 

approximately 40 of our consolidated net revenues in 2019 were generated by the snapon tools group which consists of snapon’s business operations primarily serving vehicle service and repair technicians through the company’s worldwide mobile tool distribution channel snapon’s success is dependent on its relationships with franchisees individually and collectively as they are the primary sales and service link between the company and vehicle service and repair technicians who are an important class of end users for snapon’s products and services 

if our franchisees are not successful or if we do not maintain an effective relationship with our franchisees the delivery of products the collection of receivables andor our relationship with end users could be adversely affected and thereby negatively impact our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

in addition if we are unable to maintain effective relationships with franchisees snapon or the franchisees may choose to terminate the relationship which may result in i open routes in which enduser customers are not provided reliable service ii litigation resulting from termination iii reduced collections or increased chargeoffs of franchisee receivables owed to snapon andor iv reduced collections or increased chargeoffs of finance and contract receivables 

we believe our ability to sell our products is also dependent on the number of vehicles on the road the number of miles driven and the general aging of vehicles these factors affect the frequency type and amount of service and repair performed on vehicles by technicians and therefore affect the demand for the number of technicians the prosperity of technicians and consequently the demand technicians have for our tools other products and services and the value technicians place on those products and services the use of other methods of transportation including more frequent use of public transportation could result in a decrease in the use of privately operated vehicles a decrease in the use of privately operated vehicles may lead to fewer repairs and less demand for our products 

exposure to credit risks of customers and resellers may make it difficult to collect receivables and our allowances for credit losses for receivables may prove inadequate which could adversely affect operating results and financial condition 

our financial services portfolio represents a significant portion of the company’s assets a decline in industry andor economic conditions could have the potential to weaken the financial position of some of our customers including financial services customers if circumstances surrounding our customers’ ability to repay their credit obligations were to deteriorate and result in the writedown or chargeoff of such receivables it would negatively affect our operating results for the relevant period and if large could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we maintain allowances for credit losses for receivables to provide for defaults and nonperformance which represent an estimate of losses on our receivables portfolios the determination of the appropriate levels of the allowances for credit losses involves a high degree of subjectivity and judgment and requires the company to make estimates of current credit risks which may undergo material changes the allowances may not be adequate to cover actual losses and future allowances for credit losses could materially and adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

  





our inability to provide acceptable financing alternatives to franchisees and other enduser customers could adversely impact our operating results 

an integral component of our business and profitability is our ability to offer competitive financing alternatives to franchisees and other enduser customers the lack of our ability to offer such alternatives or obtain capital resources or other financing to support our receivables on terms that we believe are attractive whether resulting from the state of the financial markets our own operating performance or other factors would negatively affect our operating results and financial condition adverse fluctuations in interest rates andor our ability to provide competitive financing programs could also have an adverse impact on our revenue and profitability 

adverse developments in the credit and financial markets could negatively impact the availability of credit that we and our customers need to operate our businesses 

we depend upon the availability of credit to operate our business including the financing of receivables from enduser customers that are originated by our financial services businesses our enduser customers franchisees and suppliers also require access to credit for their businesses at times world financial markets have been unstable and subject to uncertainty adverse developments in the credit and financial markets or unfavorable changes in snapon’s credit rating could negatively impact the availability of future financing and the terms on which it might be available to snapon its enduser customers franchisees and suppliers inability to access credit or capital markets or a deterioration in the terms on which financing might be available could have an adverse impact on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

increasing our financial leverage could affect our operations and profitability 

the maximum available credit under our multicurrency revolving credit facility is 800 million the company’s leverage ratio may affect both our availability of additional capital resources as well as our operations in several ways including 

• the terms on which credit may be available to us could be less attractive both in the economic terms of the credit and the covenants stipulated by the credit terms 

• the possible lack of availability of additional credit or access to the commercial paper market 

• the potential for higher levels of interest expense to service or maintain our outstanding debt 

• the possibility of additional borrowings in the future to repay our indebtedness when it comes due and 

• the possible diversion of capital resources from other uses 

while we believe we will have the ability to service our debt and obtain additional resources in the future if and when needed that will depend upon our results of operations and financial position at the time the thencurrent state of the credit and financial markets and other factors that may be beyond our control therefore we cannot give assurances that credit will be available on terms that we consider attractive or at all if and when necessary or beneficial to us 

furthermore a portion of our indebtedness bears interest at rates that fluctuate with changes in certain shortterm prevailing interest rates including libor although we attempt to manage our exposure to rate fluctuations via hedging arrangements such arrangements may be ineffective or may not protect us to the extent we expect in addition the united kingdom’s financial conduct authority announced that after 2021 it would no longer persuade or compel panel banks to submit the rates required to calculate libor and it is unclear whether the banks currently reporting information used to set libor will stop doing so after 2021 although the consequences of these developments cannot be predicted at this time should a suitable replacement for libor not be available the rates under our variable rate indebtedness could increase and access to capital could be limited 





data security and information technology infrastructure and security are critical to supporting business objectives failure of our systems to operate effectively could adversely affect our business and reputation 

we depend heavily on information technology infrastructure to achieve our business objectives and to protect sensitive information and continually invest in improving such systems problems that impair or compromise this infrastructure including natural disasters power outages major network failures security breaches or malicious attacks or during system upgrades andor new system implementations could impede our ability to record or process orders manufacture and ship in a timely manner manage our financial services operations including originating processing accounting for and collecting receivables protect sensitive data of the company our customers our suppliers and business partners or otherwise carry on business in the normal course any such events if significant could cause us to lose customers andor revenue and could require us to incur significant expense to remediate including as a result of legal or regulatory claims proceedings fines or penalties and could also damage our reputation while we have taken steps to maintain adequate data security and address these risks and uncertainties by implementing security technologies internal controls network and data center resiliency and redundancy and recovery processes as well as by securing insurance these measures may be inadequate 

in association with initiatives to better integrate business units rationalize operating footprint and improve responsiveness to franchisees and customers snapon is continually replacing and enhancing its global enterprise resource planning erp management information systems as we integrate implement and deploy new information technology processes and enhance our information infrastructure across our global operations we could experience disruptions in our business that could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

changes to legislation and regulations may affect our business reputation results of operations and financial condition 

significant changes to legislative and regulatory activity and compliance burdens including those associated with i sales to our government military and defense contractor customers and ii classification of third parties including our franchisees as independent from the company as well as the manner in which they are applied could significantly impact our business and the economy as a whole 

financial services businesses of all kinds are subject to significant and complex regulations and enforcement in addition to potentially increasing the costs and other requirements of doing business due to compliance obligations new laws and regulations or changes to existing laws and regulations as well as the enforcement thereof may affect the relationships between creditors and debtors inhibit the rights of creditors to collect amounts owed to them expand liability for certain actions or inactions or limit the types of financial products or services offered any or all of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows failure to comply with any of these laws or regulations could also result in civil criminal monetary andor nonmonetary penalties damage to our reputation andor the incurrence of remediation costs 

the tax cuts and jobs act in the united states the “tax act” which made significant changes to the us tax code and affects among other items the company’s tax rate previously unremitted foreign earnings and valuations of deferred tax assets and liabilities if new guidance is issued on the tax act depending on the circumstances this and other tax legislation could adversely affect our results of operations 

these developments and other potential future legislation and regulations as well as the factors in the strict regulatory environment including the growing international regulation of privacy rights may also adversely affect the customers to which and the markets into which we sell our products and increase our costs and otherwise negatively affect our business reputation results of operations and financial condition including in ways that cannot yet be foreseen 

risks associated with the disruption of manufacturing operations could adversely affect profitability or competitive position 

we manufacture a significant portion of the products we sell any prolonged disruption in the operations of our existing manufacturing facilities whether due to technical or labor difficulties facility consolidation or closure actions lack of raw material or component availability destruction of or damage to any facility as a result of natural disasters weather events use and storage of hazardous materials acts of war sabotage or terrorism or other events or other reasons could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 





the inability to continue to introduce new products that respond to customer needs and achieve market acceptance could result in lower revenues and reduced profitability 

sales from new products represent a significant portion of our net sales and are expected to continue to represent a significant component of our future net sales we may not be able to compete effectively unless we continue to enhance existing products or introduce new products to the marketplace in a timely manner product improvements and new product introductions require significant financial and other resources including significant planning design development and testing at the technological product and manufacturing process levels our competitors’ new products may beat our products to market be more effective with more features be less expensive than our products andor render our products obsolete any new products that we develop may not receive market acceptance or otherwise generate any meaningful net sales or profits for us relative to our expectations based on among other things existing and anticipated investments in manufacturing capacity and commitments to fund advertising marketing promotional programs and research and development 

failure to maintain effective distribution of products and services could adversely impact revenue gross margin and profitability 

we use a variety of distribution methods to sell our products and services successfully managing the interaction of our distribution efforts to reach various potential customer segments for our products and services is a complex process moreover since each distribution method has distinct risks costs and gross margins our failure to implement the most advantageous balance in the delivery model for our products and services could adversely affect our revenue gross margins and profitability 

  

the global tool equipment and diagnostics and repair information industries are competitive 

we face strong competition in all of our market segments price competition in our various industries is intense and pricing pressures from competitors and customers continue to increase in general as a manufacturer and marketer of premium products and services the expectations of snapon’s customers and its franchisees are high and continue to increase any inability to maintain customer satisfaction could diminish snapon’s premium image and reputation and could result in a lessening of our ability to command premium pricing we expect that the level of competition will remain high in the future which could limit our ability to maintain or increase market share or profitability 

product liability claims and litigation could affect our business reputation financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

the products that we design andor manufacture andor the services we provide can lead to product liability claims or other legal claims being filed against us to the extent that plaintiffs are successful in showing that a defect in a product’s design manufacture or warnings led to personal injury or property damage or that our provision of services resulted in similar injury or damage we may be subject to claims for damages although we are insured for damages above a certain amount we bear the costs and expenses associated with defending claims including frivolous lawsuits and are responsible for damages up to the insurance retention amount in addition to claims concerning individual products as a manufacturer we can be subject to costs potential negative publicity and lawsuits related to product recalls which could adversely impact our results of operations and damage our reputation 

legal disputes could adversely affect our business reputation financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

from time to time we are subject to legal disputes that are being litigated andor settled in the ordinary course of business disputes or future lawsuits could result in the diversion of management’s time and attention away from business operations additionally negative developments with respect to legal disputes and the costs incurred in defending ourselves even if successful could have an adverse impact on the company and its reputation successful outcomes at trial or on appeal can never be assured adverse outcomes or settlements could also require us to pay damages potentially in excess of amounts reserved or incur liability for other remedies that could have a material adverse effect on our business reputation financial condition results of operations and cash flows 





failure to adequately protect intellectual property or claims of infringement could adversely affect our business reputation financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

intellectual property rights are an important and integral component of our business and failure to obtain or maintain adequate protection of our intellectual property rights for any reason could have a material adverse effect on our business we attempt to protect our intellectual property rights through a combination of patent trademark copyright and trade secret laws as well as licensing agreements and thirdparty nondisclosure and assignment agreements in addition we have been and in the future may be subject to claims of intellectual property infringement against us by third parties whether or not these claims have merit we could be required to expend significant resources in defense of those claims adverse determinations in a judicial or administrative proceeding or via a settlement could prevent us from manufacturing and selling our products prevent us from stopping others from manufacturing and selling competing products andor result in payments for damages in the event of an infringement claim we may also be required to spend significant resources to develop alternatives or obtain licenses which may not be available on reasonable terms or at all and may reduce our sales and disrupt our production failure to obtain or maintain adequate protection of our intellectual property rights for any reason could have a material adverse effect on our business 

failure to achieve expected investment returns on pension plan assets as well as changes in interest rates or plan demographics could adversely impact our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

snapon sponsors various defined benefit pension plans the “pension plans” the assets of the pension plans are diversified in an attempt to mitigate the risk of a large loss required funding for the company’s domestic defined benefit pension plans is determined in accordance with guidelines set forth in the federal employee retirement income security act “erisa” foreign defined benefit pension plans are funded in accordance with local statutes or practice additional contributions to enhance the funded status of the pension plans can be made at the company’s discretion however there can be no assurance that the value of the pension plan assets or the investment returns on those plan assets will be sufficient to meet the future benefit obligations of such plans in addition during periods of adverse investment market conditions and declining interest rates the company may be required to make additional cash contributions to the pension plans that could reduce our financial flexibility changes in plan demographics including an increase in the number of retirements or changes in life expectancy assumptions may also increase the costs and funding requirements of the obligations related to the company’s pension plans 

  

our pension plan obligations are affected by changes in market interest rates significant fluctuations in market interest rates have added and may further add volatility to our pension plan obligations in periods of declining market interest rates our pension plan obligations generally increase in periods of increasing market interest rates our pension plan obligations generally decrease while our plan assets are broadly diversified there are inherent market risks associated with investments if adverse market conditions occur our plan assets could incur significant or material losses since we may need to make additional contributions to address changes in obligations andor a loss in plan assets the combination of declining market interest rates past or future plan asset investment losses andor changes in plan demographics could adversely impact our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

the company’s pension plan expense is comprised of the following factors i service cost ii interest on projected benefit obligations iii expected return on plan assets iv the amortization of prior service costs and credits v effects of actuarial gains and losses and vi settlementcurtailment costs when applicable the accounting for pensions involves the estimation of a number of factors that are highly uncertain certain factors such as the interest on projected benefit obligations and the expected return on plan assets are impacted by changes in market interest rates and the value of plan assets a significant decrease in market interest rates and a decrease in the fair value of plan assets would increase net pension expense and may adversely affect the company’s future results of operations see note 11 to the consolidated financial statements for further information on the company’s pension plans 

  





foreign operations are subject to political economic currency exchange and other risks that could adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

approximately 31 of our revenues in 2019 were generated outside of the united states future growth rates and success of our business depends in large part on continued growth in our nonus operations including growth in emerging markets and critical industries numerous risks and uncertainties affect our nonus operations these risks and uncertainties include political economic and social instability such as acts of war civil disturbance or acts of terrorism local labor conditions brexitrelated developments trade relations with china changes in government policies and regulations including imposition or increases in withholding and other taxes on remittances and other payments by international subsidiaries as well as the exposure to liabilities under anticorruption laws in various countries such as the us foreign corrupt practices act currency volatility transportation delays or interruptions sovereign debt uncertainties and difficulties in enforcement of contract and intellectual property rights as well as natural disasters should the economic environment in our nonus markets deteriorate from current levels our results of operations and financial position could be materially impacted including as a result of the effects of potential impairment writedowns of goodwill andor other intangible assets related to these businesses 

the reporting currency for snapon’s consolidated financial statements is the us dollar certain of the company’s assets liabilities expenses and revenues are denominated in currencies other than the us dollar in preparing snapon’s consolidated financial statements those assets liabilities expenses and revenues are translated into us dollars at applicable exchange rates increases or decreases in exchange rates between the us dollar and other currencies affect the us dollar value of those items as reflected in the consolidated financial statements substantial fluctuations in the value of the us dollar could have a significant impact on the company’s financial condition and results of operations 

we are also affected by changes in inflation rates and interest rates additionally cash generated in certain nonus jurisdictions may be difficult to repatriate to the united states in a taxefficient manner our foreign operations are also subject to other risks and challenges such as the need to staff and manage diverse workforces respond to the needs of multiple national and international marketplaces and differing business climates and cultures in various countries 

we may not successfully integrate businesses we acquire which could have an adverse impact on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

the pursuit of growth through acquisitions including participation in joint ventures involves significant risks that could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows these risks include 

• loss of the acquired businesses’ customers 

• inability to integrate successfully the acquired businesses’ operations 

• inability to coordinate management and integrate and retain employees of the acquired businesses 

• unforeseen or contingent liabilities of the acquired businesses 

• large writeoffs or writedowns or the impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets 

• difficulties in implementing and maintaining consistent standards controls procedures policies and information systems 

• failure to realize anticipated synergies economies of scale or other anticipated benefits or to maintain operating margins 

• strain on our personnel systems and resources and diversion of attention from other priorities 

• incurrence of additional debt and related interest expense and 

• the dilutive effect in the event of the issuance of additional equity securities 

the recognition of impairment charges on goodwill or other intangible assets would adversely impact our future financial condition and results of operations 

we have a substantial amount of goodwill and purchased intangible assets almost all of which are booked in the commercial  industrial group and in the repair systems  information group we are required to perform impairment tests on our goodwill and other intangibles annually or at any time when events occur that could impact the value of our business segments our determination of whether impairment has occurred is based on a comparison of each of our reporting units’ fair market value with its carrying value 

  





significant and unanticipated changes in circumstances such as significant and longterm adverse changes in business climate adverse actions by regulators unanticipated competition the loss of key customers andor changes in technology or markets could require a provision for impairment in a future period that could substantially impact our reported earnings and reduce our consolidated net worth and shareholders’ equity should the economic environment in these markets deteriorate our results of operations and financial position could be materially impacted including as a result of the effects of potential impairment writedowns of goodwill andor other intangible assets related to these businesses 

our operations expose us to the risk of environmental liabilities costs litigation and violations that could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and reputation 

certain of our operations are subject to environmental laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which they operate which impose limitations on the discharge of pollutants into the ground air and water and establish standards for the generation treatment use storage and disposal of hazardous wastes we must also comply with various health and safety regulations in the united states and abroad in connection with our operations failure to comply with any of these laws could result in civil and criminal monetary and nonmonetary penalties and damage to our reputation in addition we may incur costs related to remedial efforts or alleged environmental damage associated with past or current waste disposal practices we cannot provide assurance that our costs of complying with current or future environmental protection and health and safety laws will not exceed our estimates 

the inability to successfully defend claims from taxing authorities could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we conduct business in many countries which requires us to interpret the income tax laws and rulings in each of those taxing jurisdictions due to the subjectivity of tax laws between those jurisdictions as well as the subjectivity of factual interpretations our estimates of income tax liabilities may differ from actual payments or assessments claims from taxing authorities related to these differences could have an adverse impact on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

failure to attract retain and effectively manage qualified personnel could lead to a loss of revenue andor profitability 

snapon’s success depends in part on the efforts and abilities of its senior management team and other key employees their skills experience and industry contacts significantly benefit our operations and administration the failure to attract and retain members of our senior management team and other key employees to effectively develop personnel and to execute succession plans could have a negative effect on our operating results in addition transitions of important responsibilities to new individuals inherently include the possibility of disruptions to our business and operations which could negatively affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

the steps taken to restructure operations rationalize operating footprint lower operating expenses and achieve greater efficiencies in the supply chain could disrupt business 

we have taken steps in the past and expect to take additional steps in the future intended to improve customer service and drive further efficiencies and reduce costs some of which could be disruptive to our business these actions collectively across our operating groups are focused on the following 

• continuing to invest in initiatives focused on building a strong sales and operating presence in emerging growth markets 

• continuing to enhance service and value to our franchisees and customers 

• continuing to implement efficiency and productivity initiatives throughout the company to drive further efficiencies and reduce costs 

• continuing on the company’s existing path to improve and transform global manufacturing and the supply chain into a marketdemandbased replenishment system with lower costs 

• continuing to invest in developing and marketing new innovative highervalueadded products and advanced technologies 

• extending our products and services into additional andor adjacent markets or to new customers and 

• continuing to provide financing for and grow our portfolio of receivables within our financial services businesses 

a failure to succeed in the implementation of any or all of these actions could result in an inability to achieve our financial goals and could be disruptive to the business 





in addition any future reductions to headcount and other cost reduction measures may result in the loss of technical expertise and could adversely affect our research and development efforts as well as our ability to meet product development schedules efforts to reduce components of expense could result in the recording of charges for inventory and technologyrelated writeoffs workforce reduction costs or other charges relating to the consolidation or closure of facilities if we were to incur a substantial charge to further these efforts or are unable to effectively manage our cost reduction and restructuring efforts our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

management overview 

we believe our 2019 operating results demonstrate our commitment to providing repeatability and reliability to a wide range of professional customers performing critical tasks in workplaces of consequence while managing headwinds in certain end markets and geographies particularly in europe leveraging capabilities already demonstrated in the automotive repair arena our “coherent growth” strategy focuses on developing and expanding our professional customer base not only in automotive repair but in adjacent markets additional geographies and other areas including in critical industries where the cost and penalties for failure can be high snapon’s value proposition of making work easier for serious professionals is an ongoing strength as we move forward along our runways for coherent growth 

• enhancing the franchise network where we continued to focus on helping our franchisees extend their reach through innovative selling processes and productivity initiatives that break the traditional time and space barriers inherent in a mobile van 

• expanding with repair shop owners and managers where we continued to make progress in connecting with customers and translating the resulting insights into innovation that solves specific challenges in the repair facility 

• further extending to critical industries where we continued to grow our lines of products customized for specific industries including through further integration of acquisitions and 

• building in emerging markets where we continued to build manufacturing capacity focused product lines and distribution capability 

our strategic priorities and plans for 2020 involve continuing to build on our snapon value creation processes – our suite of strategic principles and processes we employ every day designed to create value and employed in the areas of safety quality customer connection innovation and rapid continuous improvement “rapid continuous improvement” or “rci” we expect to continue to deploy these processes in our existing operations as well as into our recently acquired businesses 

snapon’s rci initiatives employ a structured set of tools and processes across multiple businesses and geographies intended to eliminate waste and improve operations savings from snapon’s rci initiatives reflect benefits from a wide variety of ongoing efficiency productivity and process improvements including savings generated from product design cost reductions improved manufacturing line setup and changeover practices lowercost sourcing initiatives and facility consolidations unless individually significant it is not practicable to disclose each rci activity that generated savings andor segregate rci savings embedded in sales volume increases 

our global financial services operations continue to serve a significant strategic role in offering financing options to our franchisees to their customers and to customers in other parts of our business we expect that our global financial services business which includes both snapon credit llc “soc” in the united states and our other international finance subsidiaries will continue to be a meaningful contributor to our operating earnings going forward 

snapon has significant international operations and is subject to risks inherent with foreign operations including foreign currency translation fluctuations

nongaap measures 

references in this management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations to “organic sales” refer to sales from continuing operations calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america “gaap” excluding acquisitionrelated sales and the impact of foreign currency translation management evaluates the company’s sales performance based on organic sales growth which primarily reflects growth from the company’s existing businesses as a result of increased output customer base and geographic expansion new product development andor pricing and excludes sales contributions from acquired operations the company did not own as of the comparable prioryear reporting period the company’s organic sales disclosures also exclude the effects of foreign currency translation as foreign currency translation is subject to volatility that can obscure underlying business trends management believes that the nongaap financial measure of organic sales is meaningful to investors as it provides them with useful information to aid in identifying underlying growth trends in our businesses and facilitating comparisons of our sales performance with prior periods 

summary of consolidated performance 

consolidated net sales of 37300 million in 2019 decreased 107 million or 03 from 2018 levels reflecting a 454 million or 12 increase in organic sales and 75 million of acquisitionrelated sales more than offset by 636 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation

offbalancesheet arrangements 

except as included below in the section labeled “contractual obligations and commitments” and note 15 to the consolidated financial statements the company had no offbalancesheet arrangements as of 2019 year end 

contractual obligations and commitments 

a summary of snapon’s future contractual obligations and commitments as of 2019 year end are as follows 

  



snapon intends to make contributions of 87 million to its foreign pension plans and 29 million to its domestic pension plans in 2020 as required by law depending on market and other conditions snapon may make additional discretionary cash contributions to its pension plans in 2020 snapon has not presented estimated pension and postretirement funding contributions in the table above as the funding can vary from year to year based on changes in the fair value of the plan assets and actuarial assumptions see note 11 and note 12 to the consolidated financial statements for information on the company’s benefit plans and payments 

due to the uncertainty of the timing of settlements with taxing authorities snapon is unable to make reasonably reliable estimates of the period of cash settlement of unrecognized tax benefits for its remaining uncertain tax liabilities as a result 103 million of unrecognized tax benefits have been excluded from the table above see note 8 to the consolidated financial statements for information on income taxes 

    





environmental matters 

snapon is subject to various federal state and local government requirements regulating the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment snapon’s policy is to comply with these requirements and the company believes that as a general matter its policies practices and procedures are properly designed to prevent unreasonable risk of environmental damage and of resulting financial liability in connection with its business some risk of environmental damage is however inherent in some of snapon’s operations and products as it is with other companies engaged in similar businesses 

snapon is and has been engaged in the handling manufacture use and disposal of many substances classified as hazardous or toxic by one or more regulatory agencies snapon believes that as a general matter its handling manufacture use and disposal of these substances are in accordance with environmental laws and regulations it is possible however that future knowledge or other developments such as improved capability to detect substances in the environment or increasingly strict environmental laws and standards and enforcement policies could bring into question the company’s handling manufacture use or disposal of these substances 

new accounting standards 

see note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for information on new accounting standards 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the consolidated financial statements and related notes contain information that is pertinent to management’s discussion and analysis the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america “gaap” requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period these estimates are generally based on historical experience current conditions and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily available from other sources as well as identifying and assessing our accounting treatment with respect to commitments and contingencies actual results could differ from those estimates 

in addition to the company’s significant accounting policies described in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements snapon considers the following policies and estimates to be the most critical in understanding the judgments that are involved in the preparation of the company’s consolidated financial statements and the uncertainties that could impact the company’s financial position results of operations and cash flows 

impairment of goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets are tested for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the assets might be impaired annual impairment tests are performed by the company in the second quarter of each year using information available as of april month end 

snapon evaluates the recoverability of goodwill by estimating the future discounted cash flows of the businesses to which the goodwill relates estimated cash flows and related goodwill are grouped at the reporting unit level the company has determined that its reporting units for testing goodwill impairment are its operating segments or components of an operating segment that constitute a business for which discrete financial information is available and for which segment management regularly reviews the operating results within its four reportable operating segments the company has identified 11 reporting units 

  





snapon evaluates the recoverability of goodwill by utilizing an income approach that estimates the fair value of the future discounted cash flows of the reporting units to which the goodwill relates the future projections which are based on both past performance and the projections and assumptions used in the company’s operating plans are subject to change as a result of changing economic and competitive conditions this approach reflects management’s internal outlook at the reporting units which management believes provides the best determination of value due to management’s insight and experience with the reporting units significant estimates used by management in the discounted cash flows methodology include estimates of future cash flows based on expected growth rates price increases working capital levels expected benefits from rci initiatives and a weightedaverage cost of capital that reflects the specific risk profile of the reporting unit being tested the company’s methodologies for valuing goodwill are applied consistently on a yearoveryear basis the assumptions used in performing the second quarter 2019 impairment calculations were evaluated in light of thencurrent market and business conditions snapon continues to believe that the future discounted cash flow valuation model provides the most reasonable and meaningful fair value estimate based upon the reporting units’ projections of future operating results and cash flows and replicates how market participants would value the company’s reporting units in an orderly transaction 

in the event the fair value of a reporting unit is less than the carrying value including goodwill the company would then record an impairment charge based on the excess of a reporting units carrying amount over its fair value 

snapon also evaluates the recoverability of its indefinitelived trademarks by utilizing an income approach that estimates the fair value of the future discounted cash flows of each of its trademarks the future projections which are based on both past performance and the projections and assumptions used in the company’s operating plans are subject to change as a result of changing economic and competitive conditions significant estimates used by management in the discounted cash flows methodology include estimates of future cash flows based on expected growth and royalty rates expected synergies and a weightedaverage cost of capital that reflects the specific risk profile of the trademark being tested the company’s methodologies for valuing trademarks are applied consistently on a yearoveryear basis the assumptions used in performing the second quarter 2019 impairment calculations were evaluated in light of thencurrent market and business conditions snapon continues to believe that the future discounted cash flow valuation model provides the most reasonable and meaningful fair value estimate based upon the trademarks’ projected future cash flows and replicates how market participants would value the company’s trademarks in an orderly transaction 

inherent in fair value determinations are significant judgments and estimates including material assumptions about future revenue profitability and cash flows the company’s operational plans and its interpretation of current economic indicators should the operations of the businesses with which goodwill or other indefinitelived intangible assets are associated incur significant declines in profitability and cash flow due to significant and longterm deterioration in macroeconomic industry and market conditions the loss of key customers changes in technology or markets significant changes in key personnel or litigation a significant and sustained decrease in share price andor other events including effects from the sale or disposal of a reporting unit some or all of the recorded goodwill or other indefinitelived intangible assets could be subject to impairment and could result in a material adverse effect on snapon’s financial position or results of operations 

snapon completed its annual impairment testing of goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets in the second quarter of 2019 which did not result in any impairment as of 2019 year end the company has no accumulated impairment losses although the company consistently uses the same methods in developing the assumptions and estimates underlying the fair value calculations such estimates are uncertain by nature and can vary from actual results in performing its annual impairment testing the company performed a sensitivity analysis on the material assumptions used in the discounted cash flow valuation models for each of its 11 reporting units based on the company’s second quarter 2019 impairment testing and assuming a hypothetical 10 decrease in the estimated fair values of each of its 11 reporting units the hypothetical fair value of each of the company’s 11 reporting units would have been greater than its carrying value see note 7 to the consolidated financial statements for further information about goodwill and other intangible assets 

pension benefits the pension benefit obligation and related pension expense are calculated in accordance with gaap and are impacted by certain actuarial assumptions changes in these assumptions are primarily influenced by factors outside of snapon’s control such as changes in economic conditions and can have a significant effect on the amounts reported in the financial statements snapon believes that the two most critical assumptions are i the expected return on plan assets and ii the assumed discount rate 

  

snapon’s domestic pension plans have a longterm investment horizon and a total return strategy that emphasizes a capital growth objective in 2019 the longterm investment performance objective for snapon’s domestic plans’ assets was to achieve net of expense returns that met or exceeded the 745 domestic expected return on plan assets assumption snapon uses a threeyear marketrelated value asset method of amortizing the difference between actual and expected returns on its domestic plans’ assets as of 2019 year end snapon’s domestic pension plans’ assets comprised approximately 87 of the company’s worldwide pension plan assets 





based on forwardlooking capital market expectations snapon selected an expected return on plan assets assumption for its us pension plans of 725 a decrease of 20 bps from 2019 to be used in determining pension expense for 2020 in estimating the domestic expected return on plan assets snapon utilizes a nominal returns forecasting method for each asset class future returns are estimated by identifying the premium of riskier asset classes over lower risk alternatives the methodology constructs expected returns using a “building block” approach to the individual components of total return these forecasts are stated in both nominal and real after inflation terms this process first considers the longterm historical return premium based on the longest set of data available for each asset class these premiums calculated using the geometric mean are then adjusted based on current relative valuation levels macroeconomic conditions and the expected alpha related to active investment management the asset return assumption is also adjusted by an implicit expense load for estimated administrative and investmentrelated expenses since asset allocation is a key determinant of expected investment returns the current and expected mix of plan assets are also considered when setting the assumption 

pension expense increases as the expected rate of return on plan assets decreases lowering the expected rate of return assumption for snapon’s domestic pension plans’ assets by 50 bps would have increased snapon’s 2019 domestic pension expense by approximately 56 million 

the objective of snapon’s discount rate assumption is to reflect the rate at which the pension benefits could be effectively settled in making this determination the company takes into account the timing and amount of benefits that would be available under the plans the domestic discount rate as of 2019 and 2018 year end was selected based on a cash flow matching methodology developed by the company’s outside actuaries and which incorporates a review of current economic conditions this methodology matches the plans’ yearly projected cash flows for benefits and service costs to those of hypothetical bond portfolios using highquality aa rated or better corporate bonds from either moody’s investors service or standard  poor’s credit rating agencies available at the measurement date this technique calculates bond portfolios that produce adequate cash flows to pay the plans’ projected yearly benefits and then selects the portfolio with the highest yield and uses that yield as the recommended discount rate 

the selection of the 34 weightedaverage discount rate for snapon’s domestic pension plans as of 2019 year end compared to 44 as of 2018 year end represents the single rate that produces the same present value of cash flows as the estimated benefit plan payments lowering snapon’s domestic discount rate assumption by 50 bps would have increased snapon’s 2019 domestic pension expense and projected benefit obligation by approximately 43 million and 742 million respectively as of 2019 year end snapon’s domestic projected benefit obligation comprised approximately 83 of snapon’s worldwide projected benefit obligation the weightedaverage discount rate for snapon’s foreign pension plans of 21 compared to 30 as of 2018 year end represents the single rate that produces the same present value of cash flows as the estimated benefit plan payments lowering snapon’s foreign discount rate assumption by 50 bps would have increased snapon’s 2019 foreign pension expense and projected benefit obligation by approximately 16 million and 268 million respectively 

actuarial gains and losses in excess of 10 percent of the greater of the projected benefit obligation or marketrelated value of assets are amortized on a straightline basis over the average remaining service period of active participants or over the average remaining life expectancy for plans with primarily inactive participants prior service costs and credits resulting from plan amendments are amortized in equal annual amounts over the average remaining service period of active participants or over the average remaining life expectancy for plans with primarily inactive participants 

to determine the 2020 net periodic benefit cost snapon is using weightedaverage discount rates for its domestic and foreign pension plans of 34 and 21 respectively and an expected return on plan assets for its domestic pension plans of 725 the expected returns on plan assets for foreign pension plans ranged from 13 to 57 as of 2019 year end the net change in these two key assumptions from those used in 2019 is expected to increase pension expense in 2020 other factors such as changes in plan demographics and discretionary contributions may further increase or decrease pension expense in 2020 see note 11 to the consolidated financial statements for further information on pension plans 





allowance for doubtful accounts on finance receivables the allowance for doubtful accounts on finance receivables is maintained at a level management believes is adequate to cover probable losses inherent in snapon’s finance receivables portfolio as of the reporting date the allowance represents management’s estimate of the losses inherent in the company’s receivables portfolio based on ongoing assessments and evaluations of collectability and historical loss experience determination of the proper level of the allowance requires management to exercise judgment about the timing frequency and severity of credit losses that could materially affect the expense for credit losses and as a result net earnings the allowance takes into consideration numerous quantitative and qualitative factors that include receivable type historical loss experience loss migration delinquency trends collection experience current economic conditions and credit risk characteristics some of these factors are influenced by items such as the customers’ financial condition debtservicing ability past payment experience credit bureau and proprietary snapon credit model information as well as the value of the underlying collateral changes in economic conditions and assumptions including the resulting credit quality metrics relative to the performance of the finance receivable portfolio create uncertainty and could result in a change to both the allowance for doubtful accounts and expense for credit losses 

management utilizes established policies and procedures in an effort to ensure the estimates and assumptions are well controlled reviewed and consistently applied as of december 28 2019 the ratio of the allowance for doubtful accounts for finance receivables was 365 as of december 29 2018 the allowance ratio was 371 while management believes it exercises prudent judgment and applies reasonable assumptions in establishing its estimate for the allowance for finance receivables there can be no assurance that changes in economic conditions or other factors would not adversely impact the financial health of our customers and result in changes to the estimates used in the allowance calculation for reference a 100 bps increase in the allowance ratio for finance receivables as of december 28 2019 would have increased snapon’s 2019 expense for credit losses and related allowance for doubtful accounts by approximately 169 million 

for additional information on snapon’s allowances for credit losses see note 1 and note 4 to the consolidated financial statements

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

market credit and economic risks 

market risk is the potential economic loss that may result from adverse changes in the fair value of financial instruments snapon is exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates snapon is also exposed to market risk associated with the stockbased portion of its deferred compensation plans snapon monitors its exposure to these risks and attempts to manage the underlying economic exposures through the use of financial instruments such as foreign currency forward contracts interest rate swap agreements treasury lock agreements and prepaid equity forward agreements “equity forwards” snapon does not use derivative instruments for speculative or trading purposes snapon’s broadbased business activities help to reduce the impact that volatility in any particular area or related areas may have on its operating earnings as a whole snapon’s management takes an active role in the risk management process and has developed policies and procedures that require specific administrative and business functions to assist in the identification assessment and control of various risks 

foreign currency risk management 

snapon has significant international operations and is subject to certain risks inherent with foreign operations that include currency fluctuations foreign currency exchange risk exists to the extent that snapon has payment obligations or receipts denominated in currencies other than the functional currency including intercompany loans denominated in foreign currencies to manage these exposures snapon identifies naturally offsetting positions and then purchases hedging instruments to protect the residual net exposures see note 10 to the consolidated financial statements for information on foreign currency risk management 

interest rate risk management 

snapon aims to control funding costs by managing the exposure created by the differing maturities and interest rate structures of snapon’s borrowings through the use of interest rate swap agreements treasury lock agreements are used from time to time to manage the potential change in interest rates in anticipation of the possible issuance of fixed rate debt see note 10 to the consolidated financial statements for information on interest rate risk management 

snapon utilizes a valueatrisk “var” model to determine the potential oneday loss in the fair value of its interest rate and foreign exchangesensitive financial instruments from adverse changes in market factors the var model estimates were made assuming normal market conditions and a 95 confidence level snapon’s computations are based on the interrelationships among movements in various currencies and interest rates variancecovariance technique these interrelationships were determined by observing interest rate and foreign currency market changes over the preceding quarter 

the estimated maximum potential oneday loss in fair value calculated using the var model as of 2019 and 2018 year end was 99 million and 77 million respectively on interest ratesensitive financial instruments and 02 million and 01 million respectively on foreign currencysensitive financial instruments the var model is a risk management tool and does not purport to represent actual losses in fair value that will be incurred by snapon nor does it consider the potential effect of favorable changes in market factors 

stockbased deferred compensation risk management 

snapon aims to manage market risk associated with the stockbased portion of its deferred compensation plans through the use of equity forwards equity forwards are used to aid in offsetting the potential marktomarket effect on stockbased deferred compensation from changes in snapon’s stock price since stockbased deferred compensation liabilities increase as the company’s stock price rises and decrease as the company’s stock price declines the equity forwards are intended to mitigate the potential impact on compensation expense that may result from such marktomarket changes see note 10 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on stockbased deferred compensation risk management 

credit risk 

credit risk is the possibility of loss from a customer’s failure to make payments according to contract terms prior to extending credit each customer is evaluated taking into consideration various factors including the customer’s financial condition debtservicing ability past payment experience credit bureau information and other financial and qualitative factors that may affect the customer’s ability to repay as well as the value of the underlying collateral finance receivable credit risk is also monitored regularly through the use of internal proprietary custom scoring models to evaluate each transaction at the time of the application for credit snapon evaluates credit quality through the use of an internal proprietary measuring system that provides a framework to analyze finance receivables on the basis of risk factors of the individual obligor as well as transaction specific risk the finance receivables are typically monitored through an asset quality review process that closely monitors past due accounts and initiates a progressive collection action process when appropriate 





counterparty risk 

snapon is exposed to credit losses in the event of nonperformance by the counterparties to its various financial agreements including its foreign currency forward contracts interest rate swap agreements treasury lock agreements and prepaid equity forward agreements snapon does not obtain collateral or other security to support financial instruments subject to credit risk but monitors the credit standing of the counterparties and generally enters into agreements with financial institution counterparties with a credit rating of a or better snapon does not anticipate nonperformance by its counterparties but cannot provide assurances 

economic risk 

economic risk is the possibility of loss resulting from economic instability in certain areas of the world snapon continually monitors its exposure in these markets for example the company is monitoring the potential effects of the united kingdom’s exit from the european union although it is too soon to know what effects this might have on the world economy or the company inflation has not had a significant impact on the company 

as a result of the above market credit and economic risks net earnings and revenues in any particular period may not be representative of fullyear results and may vary significantly from year to year 

commodity risk 

snapon is a purchaser of certain commodities such as steel natural gas and electricity the company is also a purchaser of components and parts that are integrated into the company’s end products as well as the purchaser of certain finished goods all of which may contain various commodities including steel aluminum nickel copper and others snapon’s supply of raw materials and purchased components are generally and readily available from numerous suppliers 

the principal raw material used in the manufacture of the company’s products is steel which the company purchases in competitive pricesensitive markets to meet snapon’s high quality standards the company’s steel needs range from specialized alloys which are available only from a limited group of approved suppliers to common alloys which are available from multiple suppliers some of these materials have been and in the future may be in short supply particularly in the event of mill shutdowns or production cut backs as some steel alloys require specialized manufacturing procedures snapon could experience inventory shortages if it were required to use an alternative manufacturer on short notice steel and other raw materials components and certain finished goods inventory can exhibit price and demand cyclicality including as a result of tariffs and other trade protection measures associated unexpected price increases could result in an erosion of the margins on our products or require us to pass higher prices to snapon’s customers 

snapon believes its ability to sell product is also dependent on the number of vehicles on the road the number of miles driven and the general aging of vehicles these factors affect the frequency type and amount of service and repair performed on vehicles by technicians and therefore affect the demand for the number of technicians the prosperity of the technicians and consequently the demand technicians have for the company’s tools other products and services and the value technicians place on those products and services the use of other methods of transportation including more frequent use of public transportation could result in a decrease in the use of privately operated vehicles a decrease in the use of privately operated vehicles may lead to fewer repairs and less demand for the company’s products 

to the extent that commodity prices increase and the company does not have firm pricing agreements with its suppliers the company may experience margin declines to the extent that it is not able to increase the selling prices of its products

sales and distribution 

snapon markets and distributes its products and related services principally to professional tool and equipment users around the world the two largest market sectors are the vehicle service and repair sector and the industrial sector 

vehicle service and repair sector 

the vehicle service and repair sector has three main customer groups i professional technicians who purchase tools and diagnostic and equipment products for use in their work ii other professional customers related to vehicle repair including owners and managers of independent repair shops and oem dealerships who purchase tools and diagnostic and equipment products for use by multiple technicians within a service or repair facility and iii oems

the vehicle service and repair sector is characterized by an increasing rate of technological change within motor vehicles vehicle population growth and increasing vehicle life and the resulting effects of these changes on the businesses of both our suppliers and customers snapon believes it is a meaningful participant in the vehicle service and repair market sector 

industrial sector

the industrial sector is characterized by a highly competitive environment with multiple suppliers offering either a full line or industry specific portfolios for tools and equipment industrial customers increasingly require specialized solutions that provide repeatability and reliability in performing tasks of consequence that are specific to the particular end market in which they operate snapon believes it is a meaningful participant in the industrial tools and equipment market sector 

  

distribution channels 

snapon serves customers primarily through the following channels of distribution i the mobile van channel ii company direct sales iii distributors and iv ecommerce the following discussion summarizes snapon’s general approach for each channel and is not intended to be allinclusive 





mobile van channel 

in the united states a significant portion of sales to the vehicle service and repair sector is conducted through snapon’s mobile franchise van channel snapon’s franchisees primarily serve vehicle repair technicians and vehicle service shop owners generally providing weekly contact at the customer’s place of business franchisees’ sales are concentrated in hand and power tools tool storage products shop equipment and diagnostic and repair information products which can easily be transported in a van or trailer and demonstrated during a brief sales call franchisees purchase snapon’s products at a discount from suggested list prices and resell them at prices established by the franchisee us franchisees are provided a list of calls that serves as the basis of the franchisee’s sales route snapon’s franchisees also have the opportunity to add a limited number of additional franchises 

snapon charges nominal initial and ongoing monthly franchise fees franchise fee revenue including nominal nonrefundable initial and ongoing monthly fees primarily for sales and business training and marketing and product promotion programs is recognized as the fees are earned franchise fee revenue totaled 162 million  152 million  and 139 million  in fiscal 2018  2017  and 2016  respectively 

snapon also has a companyowned route program that is designed to i provide another pool of potential field organization personnel ii service customers in select new andor open routes not currently serviced by franchisees and iii allow snapon to pilot new sales and promotional ideas prior to introducing them to franchisees as of 2018  year end companyowned routes comprised less than 3 of the total route population snapon may elect to increase or reduce the number of companyowned routes in the future 

in addition to its mobile van channel in the united states snapon has replicated its us franchise distribution model in certain other countries including the united kingdom canada japan australia germany netherlands south africa new zealand belgium and ireland in many of these markets as in the united states purchase decisions are generally made or influenced by professional vehicle service technicians as well as repair shop owners and managers as of 2018  year end snapon’s worldwide route count was approximately 4800  including approximately 3450  routes in the united states 

through soc financing is available to us franchisees including financing for van leases working capital loans and loans to help enable new franchisees to fund the purchase of the franchise or the expansion of an existing franchise in many international markets snapon offers a variety of financing options to its franchisees andor customer networks through its international finance subsidiaries the decision to finance through snapon or another financing source is solely at the customer’s election

company direct sales 

a significant proportion of shop equipment sales in north america under the john bean hofmann blackhawk caroliner challenger and procut brands diagnostic products under the snapon brand and information products under the mitchell1 brand are made by direct and independent sales forces that have responsibility for national and other accounts as the vehicle service and repair sector consolidates with more business conducted by national chains and franchised service centers snapon believes these larger organizations can be serviced most effectively by sales people who can demonstrate and sell the full line of diagnostic and equipment products and services snapon also sells these products and services directly to oems and their franchised dealers 

  

snapon brand tools and equipment are marketed to industrial and governmental customers worldwide through both industrial sales associates and independent distributors selling activities focus on industrial customers whose main purchase criteria are quality and integrated solutions as of 2018  year end snapon had industrial sales associates and independent distributors primarily in the united states canada and in various european latin american middle eastern asian and african countries with the united states representing the majority of snapon’s total industrial sales

domain names have become a valuable corporate asset for companies around the world including snapon domain names often contain a trademark or service mark or even a corporate name and are often considered intellectual property the recognition and value of the snapon name trademark and domain name are core strengths of the company 

snapon strategically licenses the snapon brand to carefully selected manufacturing and distribution companies for items such as apparel and a variety of other goods in order to further build brand awareness and market presence for the company’s strongest brand

snapon’s liquidity and capital resources and use of working capital are discussed herein in “part ii item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations”

 item 1a risk factors 

in evaluating the company careful consideration should be given to the following risk factors in addition to the other information included in this annual report on form 10k including the consolidated financial statements and the related notes each of these risk factors could adversely affect the company’s business operating results cash flows andor financial condition as well as adversely affect the value of an investment in the company’s common stock 





economic conditions and world events could affect our operating results 

we our franchisees and our customers may be adversely affected by changing economic conditions including conditions that may particularly impact specific regions these conditions may result in reduced consumer and investor confidence instability in the credit and financial markets volatile corporate profits and reduced business and consumer spending we our franchisees and our customers and the economy as a whole also may be affected by future world or local events outside our control such as tariffs and other trade protection measures put in place by the united states or other countries acts of terrorism developments in the war on terrorism conflicts in international situations weather events and natural disasters as well as governmentrelated developments or issues these factors may affect our results of operations by reducing our sales margins andor net earnings as a result of a slowdown in customer orders or order cancellations impact the availability andor pricing of raw materials andor the supply chain and could potentially lead to future impairment of our intangible assets in addition political and social turmoil related to international conflicts and terrorist acts may put pressure on economic conditions abroad unstable political social and economic conditions may make it difficult for our franchisees customers suppliers and us to accurately forecast and plan future business activities if such conditions persist our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows could be negatively affected 

in 2016 the united kingdom voted in a referendum to exit the european union “brexit” which resulted in significant currency exchange rate fluctuations and volatility negotiations continue to determine the terms of brexit given the lack of comparable precedent and the status of the negotiations the implications of brexit or how such implications might affect snapon continue to remain unclear at this time brexit could among other impacts disrupt trade and the movement of goods services and people between the united kingdom and the european union or other countries as well as create legal and global economic uncertainty these and other potential implications could adversely affect our business and results of operations 

in 2018 canada mexico and the united states negotiated the united statesmexicocanada agreement the “usmca” which is intended to update and replace the north american free trade agreement “nafta” the usmca must be ratified by all three countries before it becomes fully effective and many of its provisions will not take effect until 2020 while the usmca is somewhat similar to nafta it contains several new compliance obligations addressing such issues as rules of origin labor standard certificate of origin documentation and de minimis thresholds as well as new policies on labor and environmental standards intellectual property protections and some digital trade provisions the company is currently analyzing the expected impact of the usmca while certain aspects of the usmca are expected to be positive others including potentially higher regulatory compliance costs may have an adverse impact on our business 

these and other matters significantly impacting the regulation of trade could adversely affect our business and results of operations 

  

raw material and energy price fluctuations and shortages including steel and various fuel sources could adversely affect the ability to obtain needed manufacturing materials and could adversely affect our results of operations 

the principal raw material used in the manufacture of our products is steel which we purchase in competitive pricesensitive markets to meet snapon’s high quality standards our steel needs range from specialized alloys which are available only from a limited group of approved suppliers to common alloys which are available from multiple suppliers some of these materials have been and in the future may be in short supply particularly in the event of mill shutdowns or production cut backs as some steel alloys require specialized manufacturing procedures we could experience inventory shortages if we were required to use an alternative manufacturer on short notice these raw materials exhibit price and demand cyclicality including tariffs and other trade protection measures enacted in fiscal 2018 and which could continue to in fiscal 2019 unexpected price increases for raw materials could result in an erosion of the margins on our products or higher prices to our customers 

we believe our ability to sell our products is also dependent on the number of vehicles on the road the number of miles driven and the general aging of vehicles these factors affect the frequency type and amount of service and repair performed on vehicles by technicians and therefore affect the demand for the number of technicians the prosperity of technicians and consequently the demand technicians have for our tools other products and services and the value technicians place on those products and services the use of other methods of transportation including more frequent use of public transportation could result in a decrease in the use of privately operated vehicles a decrease in the use of privately operated vehicles may lead to fewer repairs and less demand for our products 





we use various energy sources to transport produce and distribute products and some of our products have components that are petroleum based petroleum and energy prices have periodically increased significantly over short periods of time future volatility and changes may be caused by market fluctuations supply and demand currency fluctuations production and transportation disruptions world events and changes in governmental programs energy price increases raise both our operating costs and the costs of our materials and we may not be able to increase our prices enough to offset these costs higher prices also may reduce the level of future customer orders and our profitability 

the performance of snapon’s mobile tool distribution business depends on the success of its franchisees 

approximately 40  of our consolidated net revenues in 2018  were generated by the snapon tools group which consists of snapon’s business operations primarily serving vehicle service and repair technicians through the company’s worldwide mobile tool distribution channel snapon’s success is dependent on its relationships with franchisees individually and collectively as they are the primary sales and service link between the company and vehicle service and repair technicians who are an important class of end users for snapon’s products and services if our franchisees are not successful or if we do not maintain an effective relationship with our franchisees the delivery of products the collection of receivables andor our relationship with end users could be adversely affected and thereby negatively impact our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

in addition if we are unable to maintain effective relationships with franchisees snapon or the franchisees may choose to terminate the relationship which may result in i open routes in which enduser customers are not provided reliable service ii litigation resulting from termination iii reduced collections or increased chargeoffs of franchisee receivables owed to snapon andor iv reduced collections or increased chargeoffs of finance and contract receivables 

exposure to credit risks of customers and resellers may make it difficult to collect receivables and our allowances for credit losses for receivables may prove inadequate which could adversely affect operating results and financial condition 

our financial services portfolio represents a significant portion of the company’s assets a decline in industry andor economic conditions could have the potential to weaken the financial position of some of our customers including financial services customers if circumstances surrounding our customers’ ability to repay their credit obligations were to deteriorate and result in the writedown or chargeoff of such receivables it would negatively affect our operating results for the period in which they occur and if large could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we maintain allowances for credit losses for receivables to provide for defaults and nonperformance which represent an estimate of losses of our receivables portfolios the determination of the appropriate levels of the allowances for credit losses inherently involves a high degree of subjectivity and judgment and requires us to make estimates of current credit risks which may undergo material changes the allowances may not be adequate to cover actual losses and future allowances for credit losses could materially and adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

  

our inability to provide acceptable financing alternatives to franchisees and other enduser customers could adversely impact our operating results 

an integral component of our business and profitability is our ability to offer competitive financing alternatives to franchisees and other enduser customers the lack of our ability to offer such alternatives or obtain capital resources or other financing to support our receivables on terms that we believe are attractive whether resulting from the state of the financial markets our own operating performance or other factors would negatively affect our operating results and financial condition adverse fluctuations in interest rates andor our ability to provide competitive financing programs could also have an adverse impact on our revenue and profitability 

adverse developments in the credit and financial markets could negatively impact the availability of credit that we and our customers need to operate our businesses 

we depend upon the availability of credit to operate our business including the financing of receivables from enduser customers that are originated by our financial services businesses our enduser customers franchisees and suppliers also require access to credit for their businesses at times world financial markets have been unstable and subject to uncertainty adverse developments in the credit and financial markets or unfavorable changes in snapon’s credit rating could negatively impact the availability of future financing and the terms on which it might be available to snapon its enduser customers franchisees and suppliers inability to access credit or capital markets or a deterioration in the terms on which financing might be available could have an adverse impact on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 





increasing our financial leverage could affect our operations and profitability 

the maximum available credit under our multicurrency revolving credit facility is 700 million the company’s leverage ratio may affect both our availability of additional capital resources as well as our operations in several ways including 

 while we believe we will have the ability to service our debt and obtain additional resources in the future if and when needed that will depend upon our results of operations and financial position at the time the thencurrent state of the credit and financial markets and other factors that may be beyond our control therefore we cannot give assurances that credit will be available on terms that we consider attractive or at all if and when necessary or beneficial to us 

data security and information technology infrastructure and security are critical to supporting business objectives failure of our systems to operate effectively could adversely affect our business and reputation 

we depend heavily on information technology infrastructure to achieve our business objectives and to protect sensitive information and continually invest in improving such systems problems that impair or compromise this infrastructure including natural disasters power outages major network failures security breaches or malicious attacks or during system upgrades andor new system implementations could impede our ability to record or process orders manufacture and ship in a timely manner manage our financial services operations including originating processing accounting for and collecting receivables protect sensitive data of the company our customers our suppliers and business partners or otherwise carry on business in the normal course any such events if significant could cause us to lose customers andor revenue and could require us to incur significant expense to remediate including as a result of legal or regulatory claims proceedings fines or penalties and could also damage our reputation while we have taken steps to maintain adequate data security and address these risks and uncertainties by implementing security technologies internal controls network and data center resiliency and redundancy and recovery processes as well as by securing insurance these measures may be inadequate 

in association with initiatives to better integrate business units rationalize operating footprint and improve responsiveness to franchisees and customers snapon is continually replacing and enhancing its global enterprise resource planning erp management information systems as we integrate implement and deploy new information technology processes and enhance our common information infrastructure across our global operations we could experience disruptions in our business that could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

changes to legislation and regulations may affect our business reputation results of operations and financial condition 

significant changes to legislative and regulatory activity and compliance burdens including those associated with sales to our government military and defense contractor customers as well as the manner in which they are applied could significantly impact our business and the economy as a whole 

financial services businesses of all kinds are subject to significant and complex regulations and enforcement in addition to potentially increasing the costs of doing business due to compliance obligations new laws and regulations or changes to existing laws and regulations as well as the enforcement thereof may affect the relationships between creditors and debtors inhibit the rights of creditors to collect amounts owed to them expand liability for certain actions or inactions or limit the types of financial products or services offered any or all of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows failure to comply with any of these laws or regulations could also result in civil criminal monetary andor nonmonetary penalties damage to our reputation andor the incurrence of remediation costs 

in fiscal 2018 snapon’s results of operations were impacted and in the future could be further affected by changes in the company’s effective tax rate as a result of changes in statutory tax rates laws and regulations as well as related guidance the tax cuts and jobs act in the united states the “tax act” which made significant changes to the us tax code and affects among other items the company’s tax rate previously unremitted foreign earnings and valuations of deferred tax assets and liabilities if new guidance is issued on the recently enacted tax revisions depending on the circumstances this and other tax legislation could adversely affect our results of operations 





these developments and other potential future legislation and regulations as well as the factors in the strict regulatory environment including the growing international regulation of privacy rights may also adversely affect the customers to which and the markets into which we sell our products and increase our costs and otherwise negatively affect our business reputation results of operations and financial condition including in ways that cannot yet be foreseen 

failure to achieve expected investment returns on pension plan assets as well as changes in interest rates or plan demographics could adversely impact our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

snapon sponsors various defined benefit pension plans the “pension plans” the assets of the pension plans are diversified in an attempt to mitigate the risk of a large loss required funding for the company’s domestic defined benefit pension plans is determined in accordance with guidelines set forth in the federal employee retirement income security act “erisa” foreign defined benefit pension plans are funded in accordance with local statutes or practice additional contributions to enhance the funded status of the pension plans can be made at the company’s discretion however there can be no assurance that the value of the pension plan assets or the investment returns on those plan assets will be sufficient to meet the future benefit obligations of such plans in addition during periods of adverse investment market conditions and declining interest rates the company may be required to make additional cash contributions to the pension plans that could reduce our financial flexibility changes in plan demographics including an increase in the number of retirements or changes in life expectancy assumptions may also increase the costs and funding requirements of the obligations related to the company’s pension plans 

  

our pension plan obligations are affected by changes in market interest rates significant fluctuations in market interest rates have added and may further add volatility to our pension plan obligations in periods of declining market interest rates our pension plan obligations generally increase in periods of increasing market interest rates our pension plan obligations generally decrease while our plan assets are broadly diversified there are inherent market risks associated with investments if adverse market conditions occur our plan assets could incur significant or material losses since we may need to make additional contributions to address changes in obligations andor a loss in plan assets the combination of declining market interest rates past or future plan asset investment losses andor changes in plan demographics could adversely impact our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

the company’s pension plan expense is comprised of the following factors i service cost ii interest on projected benefit obligations iii expected return on plan assets iv the amortization of prior service costs and credits v effects of actuarial gains and losses and vi settlementcurtailment costs when applicable the accounting for pensions involves the estimation of a number of factors that are highly uncertain certain factors such as the interest on projected benefit obligations and the expected return on plan assets are impacted by changes in market interest rates and the value of plan assets a significant decrease in market interest rates and a decrease in the fair value of plan assets would increase net pension expense and may adversely affect the company’s future results of operations see note 12 to the consolidated financial statements for further information on the company’s pension plans 

failure to maintain effective distribution of products and services could adversely impact revenue gross margin and profitability 

we use a variety of distribution methods to sell our products and services successfully managing the interaction of our distribution efforts to reach various potential customer segments for our products and services is a complex process moreover since each distribution method has distinct risks costs and gross margins our failure to implement the most advantageous balance in the delivery model for our products and services could adversely affect our revenue and gross margins and therefore our profitability 

risks associated with the disruption of manufacturing operations could adversely affect profitability or competitive position 

we manufacture a significant portion of the products we sell any prolonged disruption in the operations of our existing manufacturing facilities whether due to technical or labor difficulties facility consolidation or closure actions lack of raw material or component availability destruction of or damage to any facility as a result of natural disasters weather events use and storage of hazardous materials acts of war sabotage or terrorism or other events or other reasons could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 





the inability to continue to introduce new products that respond to customer needs and achieve market acceptance could result in lower revenues and reduced profitability 

sales from new products represent a significant portion of our net sales and are expected to continue to represent a significant component of our future net sales we may not be able to compete effectively unless we continue to enhance existing products or introduce new products to the marketplace in a timely manner product improvements and new product introductions require significant financial and other resources including significant planning design development and testing at the technological product and manufacturing process levels our competitors’ new products may beat our products to market be more effective with more features be less expensive than our products andor render our products obsolete any new products that we develop may not receive market acceptance or otherwise generate any meaningful net sales or profits for us relative to our expectations based on among other things existing and anticipated investments in manufacturing capacity and commitments to fund advertising marketing promotional programs and research and development 

  

the global tool equipment and diagnostics and repair information industries are competitive 

we face strong competition in all of our market segments price competition in our various industries is intense and pricing pressures from competitors and customers are increasing in general as a manufacturer and marketer of premium products and services the expectations of snapon’s customers and its franchisees are high and continue to increase any inability to maintain customer satisfaction could diminish snapon’s premium image and reputation and could result in a lessening of our ability to command premium pricing we expect that the level of competition will remain high in the future which could limit our ability to maintain or increase market share or profitability 

product liability claims and litigation could affect our business reputation financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

the products that we design andor manufacture andor the services we provide can lead to product liability claims or other legal claims being filed against us to the extent that plaintiffs are successful in showing that a defect in a product’s design manufacture or warnings led to personal injury or property damage or that our provision of services resulted in similar injury or damage we may be subject to claims for damages although we are insured for damages above a certain amount we bear the costs and expenses associated with defending claims including frivolous lawsuits and are responsible for damages up to the insurance retention amount in addition to claims concerning individual products as a manufacturer we can be subject to costs potential negative publicity and lawsuits related to product recalls which could adversely impact our results of operations and damage our reputation 

legal disputes could adversely affect our business reputation financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

from time to time we are subject to legal disputes that are being litigated andor settled in the ordinary course of business disputes or future lawsuits could result in the diversion of management’s time and attention away from business operations additionally negative developments with respect to legal disputes and the costs incurred in defending ourselves even if successful could have an adverse impact on the company and its reputation successful outcomes at trial or on appeal can never be assured adverse outcomes or settlements could also require us to pay damages potentially in excess of amounts reserved or incur liability for other remedies that could have a material adverse effect on our business reputation financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

failure to adequately protect intellectual property or claims of infringement could adversely affect our business reputation financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

intellectual property rights are an important and integral component of our business and failure to obtain or maintain adequate protection of our intellectual property rights for any reason could have a material adverse effect on our business we attempt to protect our intellectual property rights through a combination of patent trademark copyright and trade secret laws as well as licensing agreements and thirdparty nondisclosure and assignment agreements in addition we have been and in the future may be subject to claims of intellectual property infringement against us by third parties whether or not these claims have merit we could be required to expend significant resources in defense of those claims adverse determinations in a judicial or administrative proceeding could prevent us from manufacturing and selling our products prevent us from stopping others from manufacturing and selling competing products andor result in payments for damages in the event of an infringement claim we may also be required to spend significant resources to develop alternatives or obtain licenses which may not be available on reasonable terms or at all and may reduce our sales and disrupt our production failure to obtain or maintain adequate protection of our intellectual property rights for any reason could have a material adverse effect on our business 

  





foreign operations are subject to political economic currency exchange and other risks that could adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

approximately 33  of our revenues in 2018  were generated outside of the united states future growth rates and success of our business depends in large part on continued growth in our nonus operations including growth in emerging markets and critical industries numerous risks and uncertainties affect our nonus operations these risks and uncertainties include political economic and social instability such as acts of war civil disturbance or acts of terrorism local labor conditions changes in government policies and regulations including imposition or increases in withholding and other taxes on remittances and other payments by international subsidiaries as well as the exposure to liabilities under anticorruption laws in various countries such as the us foreign corrupt practices act currency volatility transportation delays or interruptions sovereign debt uncertainties and difficulties in enforcement of contract and intellectual property rights as well as natural disasters should the economic environment in our nonus markets deteriorate from current levels our results of operations and financial position could be materially impacted including as a result of the effects of potential impairment writedowns of goodwill andor other intangible assets related to these businesses 

the reporting currency for snapon’s consolidated financial statements is the us dollar certain of the company’s assets liabilities expenses and revenues are denominated in currencies other than the us dollar in preparing snapon’s consolidated financial statements those assets liabilities expenses and revenues are translated into us dollars at applicable exchange rates increases or decreases in exchange rates between the us dollar and other currencies affect the us dollar value of those items as reflected in the consolidated financial statements substantial fluctuations in the value of the us dollar could have a significant impact on the company’s financial condition and results of operations 

we are also affected by changes in inflation rates and interest rates additionally cash generated in certain nonus jurisdictions may be difficult to repatriate to the united states in a taxefficient manner our foreign operations are also subject to other risks and challenges such as the need to staff and manage diverse workforces respond to the needs of multiple national and international marketplaces and differing business climates and cultures in various countries 

we may not successfully integrate businesses we acquire which could have an adverse impact on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

the pursuit of growth through acquisitions including participation in joint ventures involves significant risks that could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows these risks include 

 the recognition of impairment charges on goodwill or other intangible assets would adversely impact our future financial condition and results of operations 

we have a substantial amount of goodwill and purchased intangible assets almost all of which are booked in the commercial  industrial group and in the repair systems  information group we are required to perform impairment tests on our goodwill and other intangibles annually or at any time when events occur that could impact the value of our business segments our determination of whether impairment has occurred is based on a comparison of each of our reporting units’ fair market value with its carrying value 

  





significant and unanticipated changes in circumstances such as significant and longterm adverse changes in business climate adverse actions by regulators unanticipated competition the loss of key customers andor changes in technology or markets could require a provision for impairment in a future period that could substantially impact our reported earnings and reduce our consolidated net worth and shareholders’ equity should the economic environment in these markets deteriorate our results of operations and financial position could be materially impacted including as a result of the effects of potential impairment writedowns of goodwill andor other intangible assets related to these businesses 

our operations expose us to the risk of environmental liabilities costs litigation and violations that could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and reputation 

certain of our operations are subject to environmental laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which they operate which impose limitations on the discharge of pollutants into the ground air and water and establish standards for the generation treatment use storage and disposal of hazardous wastes we must also comply with various health and safety regulations in the united states and abroad in connection with our operations failure to comply with any of these laws could result in civil and criminal monetary and nonmonetary penalties and damage to our reputation in addition we may incur costs related to remedial efforts or alleged environmental damage associated with past or current waste disposal practices we cannot provide assurance that our costs of complying with current or future environmental protection and health and safety laws will not exceed our estimates 

the inability to successfully defend claims from taxing authorities could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we conduct business in many countries which requires us to interpret the income tax laws and rulings in each of those taxing jurisdictions due to the subjectivity of tax laws between those jurisdictions as well as the subjectivity of factual interpretations our estimates of income tax liabilities may differ from actual payments or assessments claims from taxing authorities related to these differences could have an adverse impact on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

failure to attract and retain qualified personnel could lead to a loss of revenue andor profitability 

snapon’s success depends in part on the efforts and abilities of its senior management team and other key employees their skills experience and industry contacts significantly benefit our operations and administration the failure to attract and retain members of our senior management team and other key employees could have a negative effect on our operating results in addition transitions of important responsibilities to new individuals inherently include the possibility of disruptions to our business and operations which could negatively affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

the steps taken to restructure operations rationalize operating footprint lower operating expenses and achieve greater efficiencies in the supply chain could disrupt business 

we have taken steps in the past and expect to take additional steps in the future intended to improve customer service and drive further efficiencies and reduce costs some of which could be disruptive to our business these actions collectively across our operating groups are focused on the following 

 

a failure to succeed in the implementation of any or all of these actions could result in an inability to achieve our financial goals and could be disruptive to the business 





in addition any future reductions to headcount and other cost reduction measures may result in the loss of technical expertise and could adversely affect our research and development efforts as well as our ability to meet product development schedules efforts to reduce components of expense could result in the recording of charges for inventory and technologyrelated writeoffs workforce reduction costs or other charges relating to the consolidation or closure of facilities if we were to incur a substantial charge to further these efforts our earnings per share would be adversely affected in such period if we are unable to effectively manage our cost reduction and restructuring efforts our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows could be negatively affected

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

management overview 

references in this management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations to “organic sales” refer to sales from continuing operations calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america “gaap” excluding acquisitionrelated sales and the impact of foreign currency translation management evaluates the company’s sales performance based on organic sales growth which primarily reflects growth from the company’s existing businesses as a result of increased output customer base and geographic expansion new product development andor pricing and excludes sales contributions from acquired operations the company did not own as of the comparable prioryear reporting period the company’s organic sales disclosures also exclude the effects of foreign currency translation as foreign currency translation is subject to volatility that can obscure underlying business trends management believes that the nongaap financial measure of organic sales is meaningful to investors as it provides them with useful information to aid in identifying underlying growth trends in our businesses and facilitating comparisons of our sales performance with prior periods 

we believe our 2018  operating results demonstrate our commitment in providing repeatability and reliability to a wide range of professional customers performing critical tasks in workplaces of consequence leveraging capabilities already demonstrated in the automotive repair arena our “coherent growth” strategy focuses on developing and expanding our professional customer base not only in automotive repair but in adjacent markets additional geographies and other areas including in critical industries where the cost and penalties for failure can be high snapon’s value proposition of making work easier for serious professionals in workplaces of consequence is an ongoing strength as we move forward along our runways for coherent growth 

 our strategic priorities and plans for 2019  will continue to build on our snapon value creation processes – our suite of strategic principles and processes we employ every day designed to create value and employed in the areas of safety quality customer connection innovation and rapid continuous improvement “rapid continuous improvement” or “rci” we expect to continue to deploy these processes in our existing operations as well as into our recently acquired businesses 

snapon’s rci initiatives employ a structured set of tools and processes across multiple businesses and geographies intended to eliminate waste and improve operations savings from snapon’s rci initiatives reflect benefits from a wide variety of ongoing efficiency productivity and process improvements including savings generated from product design cost reductions improved manufacturing line setup and changeover practices lowercost sourcing initiatives and facility consolidations unless individually significant it is not practicable to disclose each rci activity that generated savings andor segregate rci savings embedded in sales volume increases 

our global financial services operations continue to serve a significant strategic role in offering financing options to our franchisees to their customers and to customers in other parts of our business we expect that our global financial services business which includes both snapon credit llc “soc” in the united states and our other international finance subsidiaries will continue to be a meaningful contributor to our operating earnings going forward 

snapon has significant international operations and is subject to risks inherent with foreign operations including foreign currency translation fluctuations

impact of the tax act 

on december 22 2017 the us government passed the tax act the tax act makes broad and complex changes to the us tax code including but not limited to i reducing the future us federal corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent ii requiring companies to pay a onetime transition tax on certain unremitted earnings of foreign subsidiaries and iii bonus depreciation that will allow for full expensing of qualified property 

the tax act also established new tax laws that affected 2018 including but not limited to i the reduction of the us federal corporate tax rate discussed above ii a general elimination of us federal income taxes on dividends from foreign subsidiaries iii a new provision designed to tax global intangible lowtaxed income “gilti” iv the repeal of the domestic production activity deductions v limitations on the deductibility of certain executive compensation vi limitations on the use of foreign tax credits to reduce the us income tax liability and vii a new provision that allows a domestic corporation an immediate deduction for a portion of its foreign derived intangible income “fdii” 

the securities and exchange commission staff issued staff accounting bulletin “sab” 118 which provides guidance on accounting for the tax effects of the tax act for the company’s year ended december 30 2017 sab 118 provides a measurement period that should not extend beyond one year from the tax act enactment date for companies to complete the related accounting under accounting standards codification “asc” 740 accounting for income taxes  in accordance with sab 118 a company must reflect the income tax effects of those aspects of the tax act for which the accounting under asc 740 is complete to the extent that a company’s accounting for a certain income tax effect of the tax act is incomplete but it is able to determine a reasonable estimate it must record a provisional estimate in the financial statements if a company cannot determine a provisional estimate to be included in the financial statements it should continue to apply asc 740 on the basis of the provisions of the tax laws that were in effect immediately before the enactment of the tax act 





the company’s accounting for certain elements of the tax act was incomplete as of december 30 2017 however the company was able to make reasonable estimates of the effects and therefore recorded provisional estimates for these items in connection with its initial analysis of the impact of the tax act the company recorded a provisional discrete net tax expense of 70 million  in the fiscal year ended december 29 2017  this provisional estimate consists of a net expense of 137 million  for the onetime transition tax and a net benefit of 67 million  related to revaluation of deferred tax assets and liabilities caused by the new lower corporate tax rate to determine the transition tax the company must determine the amount of post1986 accumulated earnings and profits of the relevant subsidiaries as well as the amount of nonus income taxes paid on such earnings while the company was able to make a reasonable estimate of the transition tax for 2017  it continued to gather additional information to more precisely compute the final amount reported on its 2017  us federal tax return which was filed in october 2018 the actual transition tax reported was 83 million greater than the company’s initial estimate and was included in income tax expense for 2018 likewise while the company was able to make a reasonable estimate of the impact of the reduction to the corporate tax rate it was affected by other analyses related to the tax act including but not limited to the state tax effect of adjustments made to federal temporary differences during 2018  the company recorded additional net tax benefits of 44 million  attributable to pension contributions made in 2018  that were deductible for 2017  at the higher 35  federal tax rate and other changes to the 2017  tax provision related to the tax act and subsequently issued tax guidance due to the complexity of the new gilti tax rules the company continued to evaluate this provision of the tax act and the application of asc 740 throughout 2018  under gaap the company is allowed to make an accounting policy choice to either i treat taxes due on future us inclusions in taxable income related to gilti as a currentperiod expense when incurred the “period cost method” or ii factor in such amounts into a company’s measurement of its deferred taxes the “deferred method” the company selected to apply the “period cost method” to account for the new gilti tax and treated it as a currentperiod expense for 2018  the company will continue to analyze the full effects of the tax act on its financial statements in 2019  as additional guidance is issued and interpretations evolve

offbalancesheet arrangements 

except as included below in the section labeled “contractual obligations and commitments” and note 16 to the consolidated financial statements the company had no offbalancesheet arrangements as of 2018  year end 

contractual obligations and commitments 

a summary of snapon’s future contractual obligations and commitments as of 2018  year end are as follows 

  



snapon intends to make contributions of 94 million  to its foreign pension plans and 19 million  to its domestic pension plans in 2019  as required by law depending on market and other conditions snapon may make additional discretionary cash contributions to its pension plans in 2019  snapon has not presented estimated pension and postretirement funding contributions in the table above as the funding can vary from year to year based on changes in the fair value of the plan assets and actuarial assumptions see note 12 and note 13 to the consolidated financial statements for information on the company’s benefit plans and payments 

due to the uncertainty of the timing of settlements with taxing authorities snapon is unable to make reasonably reliable estimates of the period of cash settlement of unrecognized tax benefits for its remaining uncertain tax liabilities as a result 111 million  of unrecognized tax benefits have been excluded from the table above see note 9 to the consolidated financial statements for information on income taxes 

    

environmental matters 

snapon is subject to various federal state and local government requirements regulating the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment snapon’s policy is to comply with these requirements and the company believes that as a general matter its policies practices and procedures are properly designed to prevent unreasonable risk of environmental damage and of resulting financial liability in connection with its business some risk of environmental damage is however inherent in some of snapon’s operations and products as it is with other companies engaged in similar businesses 

snapon is and has been engaged in the handling manufacture use and disposal of many substances classified as hazardous or toxic by one or more regulatory agencies snapon believes that as a general matter its handling manufacture use and disposal of these substances are in accordance with environmental laws and regulations it is possible however that future knowledge or other developments such as improved capability to detect substances in the environment or increasingly strict environmental laws and standards and enforcement policies could bring into question the company’s handling manufacture use or disposal of these substances 

new accounting standards 

see note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for information on new accounting standards 





critical accounting policies and estimates 

the consolidated financial statements and related notes contain information that is pertinent to management’s discussion and analysis the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america “gaap” requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period these estimates are generally based on historical experience current conditions and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily available from other sources as well as identifying and assessing our accounting treatment with respect to commitments and contingencies actual results could differ from those estimates 

in addition to the company’s significant accounting policies described in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements snapon considers the following policies and estimates to be the most critical in understanding the judgments that are involved in the preparation of the company’s consolidated financial statements and the uncertainties that could impact the company’s financial position results of operations and cash flows 

impairment of goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets  goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets are tested for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the assets might be impaired annual impairment tests are performed by the company in the second quarter of each year using information available as of fiscal april month end 

snapon evaluates the recoverability of goodwill by estimating the future discounted cash flows of the businesses to which the goodwill relates estimated cash flows and related goodwill are grouped at the reporting unit level the company has determined that its reporting units for testing goodwill impairment are its operating segments or components of an operating segment that constitute a business for which discrete financial information is available and for which segment management regularly reviews the operating results within its four reportable operating segments the company has identified 11 reporting units 

  

snapon evaluates the recoverability of goodwill by utilizing an income approach that estimates the fair value of the future discounted cash flows of the reporting units to which the goodwill relates the future projections which are based on both past performance and the projections and assumptions used in the company’s operating plans are subject to change as a result of changing economic and competitive conditions this approach reflects management’s internal outlook at the reporting units which management believes provides the best determination of value due to management’s insight and experience with the reporting units significant estimates used by management in the discounted cash flows methodology include estimates of future cash flows based on expected growth rates price increases working capital levels expected benefits from rci initiatives and a weightedaverage cost of capital that reflects the specific risk profile of the reporting unit being tested the company’s methodologies for valuing goodwill are applied consistently on a yearoveryear basis the assumptions used in performing the second quarter 2018  impairment calculations were evaluated in light of thencurrent market and business conditions snapon continues to believe that the future discounted cash flow valuation model provides the most reasonable and meaningful fair value estimate based upon the reporting units’ projections of future operating results and cash flows and replicates how market participants would value the company’s reporting units in an orderly transaction 

in the event the fair value of a reporting unit is less than the carrying value including goodwill the company would then record an impairment charge based on the excess of a reporting units carrying amount over its fair value 

snapon also evaluates the recoverability of its indefinitelived trademarks by utilizing an income approach that estimates the fair value of the future discounted cash flows of each of its trademarks the future projections which are based on both past performance and the projections and assumptions used in the company’s operating plans are subject to change as a result of changing economic and competitive conditions significant estimates used by management in the discounted cash flows methodology include estimates of future cash flows based on expected growth and royalty rates expected synergies and a weightedaverage cost of capital that reflects the specific risk profile of the trademark being tested the company’s methodologies for valuing trademarks are applied consistently on a yearoveryear basis the assumptions used in performing the second quarter 2018  impairment calculations were evaluated in light of thencurrent market and business conditions snapon continues to believe that the future discounted cash flow valuation model provides the most reasonable and meaningful fair value estimate based upon the trademarks’ projected future cash flows and replicates how market participants would value the company’s trademarks in an orderly transaction 





inherent in fair value determinations are significant judgments and estimates including material assumptions about future revenue profitability and cash flows the company’s operational plans and its interpretation of current economic indicators should the operations of the businesses with which goodwill or other indefinitelived intangible assets are associated incur significant declines in profitability and cash flow due to significant and longterm deterioration in macroeconomic industry and market conditions the loss of key customers changes in technology or markets significant changes in key personnel or litigation a significant and sustained decrease in share price andor other events including effects from the sale or disposal of a reporting unit some or all of the recorded goodwill or other indefinitelived intangible assets could be subject to impairment and could result in a material adverse effect on snapon’s financial position or results of operations 

snapon completed its annual impairment testing of goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets in the second quarter of 2018  which did not result in any impairment as of 2018  year end the company has no accumulated impairment losses although the company consistently uses the same methods in developing the assumptions and estimates underlying the fair value calculations such estimates are uncertain by nature and can vary from actual results in performing its annual impairment testing the company performed a sensitivity analysis on the material assumptions used in the discounted cash flow valuation models for each of its 11 reporting units based on the company’s second quarter 2018  impairment testing and assuming a hypothetical 10 decrease in the estimated fair values of each of its 11 reporting units the hypothetical fair value of each of the company’s 11 reporting units would have been greater than its carrying value see note 7 to the consolidated financial statements for further information about goodwill and other intangible assets 

pension benefits  the pension benefit obligation and related pension expense are calculated in accordance with gaap and are impacted by certain actuarial assumptions changes in these assumptions are primarily influenced by factors outside of snapon’s control such as changes in economic conditions and can have a significant effect on the amounts reported in the financial statements snapon believes that the two most critical assumptions are i the expected return on plan assets and ii the assumed discount rate 

  

snapon’s domestic pension plans have a longterm investment horizon and a total return strategy that emphasizes a capital growth objective in 2018  the longterm investment performance objective for snapon’s domestic plans’ assets was to achieve net of expense returns that met or exceeded the 745 domestic expected return on plan assets assumption snapon uses a threeyear marketrelated value asset method of amortizing the difference between actual and expected returns on its domestic plans’ assets as of 2018  year end snapon’s domestic pension plans’ assets comprised approximately 86 of the company’s worldwide pension plan assets 

based on forwardlooking capital market expectations snapon selected an expected return on plan assets assumption for its us pension plans of 745 the same as 2018  to be used in determining pension expense for 2019 in estimating the domestic expected return on plan assets snapon utilizes a nominal returns forecasting method for each asset class future returns are estimated by identifying the premium of riskier asset classes over lower risk alternatives the methodology constructs expected returns using a “building block” approach to the individual components of total return these forecasts are stated in both nominal and real after inflation terms this process first considers the longterm historical return premium based on the longest set of data available for each asset class these premiums calculated using the geometric mean are then adjusted based on current relative valuation levels macroeconomic conditions and the expected alpha related to active investment management the asset return assumption is also adjusted by an implicit expense load for estimated administrative and investmentrelated expenses since asset allocation is a key determinant of expected investment returns the current and expected mix of plan assets are also considered when setting the assumption 

pension expense increases as the expected rate of return on plan assets decreases lowering the expected rate of return assumption for snapon’s domestic pension plans’ assets by 50 bps would have increased snapon’s 2018  domestic pension expense by approximately 53 million 

the objective of snapon’s discount rate assumption is to reflect the rate at which the pension benefits could be effectively settled in making this determination the company takes into account the timing and amount of benefits that would be available under the plans the domestic discount rate as of 2018  and 2017  year end was selected based on a cash flow matching methodology developed by the company’s outside actuaries and which incorporates a review of current economic conditions this methodology matches the plans’ yearly projected cash flows for benefits and service costs to those of hypothetical bond portfolios using highquality aa rated or better corporate bonds from either moody’s investors service or standard  poor’s credit rating agencies available at the measurement date this technique calculates bond portfolios that produce adequate cash flows to pay the plans’ projected yearly benefits and then selects the portfolio with the highest yield and uses that yield as the recommended discount rate 





the selection of the 44  weightedaverage discount rate for snapon’s domestic pension plans as of 2018  year end compared to 39 as of 2017  year end represents the single rate that produces the same present value of cash flows as the estimated benefit plan payments lowering snapon’s domestic discount rate assumption by 50 bps would have increased snapon’s 2018  domestic pension expense and projected benefit obligation by approximately 37 million  and 629 million  respectively as of 2018  year end snapon’s domestic projected benefit obligation comprised approximately 83 of snapon’s worldwide projected benefit obligation the weightedaverage discount rate for snapon’s foreign pension plans of 30  compared to 27 as of 2017  year end represents the single rate that produces the same present value of cash flows as the estimated benefit plan payments lowering snapon’s foreign discount rate assumption by 50 bps would have increased snapon’s 2018 foreign pension expense and projected benefit obligation by approximately 19 million  and 210 million  respectively 

actuarial gains and losses in excess of 10 percent of the greater of the projected benefit obligation or marketrelated value of assets are amortized on a straightline basis over the average remaining service period of active participants or over the average remaining life expectancy for plans with primarily inactive participants prior service costs and credits resulting from plan amendments are amortized in equal annual amounts over the average remaining service period of active participants or over the average remaining life expectancy for plans with primarily inactive participants 

to determine the 2019 net periodic benefit cost snapon is using weightedaverage discount rates for its domestic and foreign pension plans of 44  and 30  respectively and an expected return on plan assets for its domestic pension plans of 745 the expected returns on plan assets for foreign pension plans ranged from 20  and 61  as of 2018  year end the net change in these two key assumptions from those used in 2018  is expected to decrease pension expense in 2019 other factors such as changes in plan demographics and discretionary contributions may further increase or decrease pension expense in 2019 see note 12 to the consolidated financial statements for further information on pension plans 

allowance for doubtful accounts on finance receivables  the allowance for doubtful accounts on finance receivables is maintained at a level management believes is adequate to cover probable losses inherent in snapon’s finance receivables portfolio as of the measurement date the allowance represents management’s estimate of the losses inherent in the company’s receivables portfolio based on ongoing assessments and evaluations of collectability and historical loss experience determination of the proper level of the allowance requires management to exercise judgment about the timing frequency and severity of credit losses that could materially affect the provision for credit losses and as a result net earnings the allowance takes into consideration numerous quantitative and qualitative factors that include receivable type historical loss experience loss migration delinquency trends collection experience current economic conditions and credit risk characteristics some of these factors are influenced by items such as the customers’ financial condition debtservicing ability past payment experience and credit bureau and proprietary snapon credit model information as well as the value of the underlying collateral changes in economic conditions and assumptions including the resulting credit quality metrics relative to the performance of the finance receivable portfolio create uncertainty and could result in a change to both the allowance for doubtful accounts and provision for credit losses 

management utilizes established policies and procedures in an effort to ensure the estimates and assumptions are well controlled reviewed and consistently applied as of december 29 2018  the ratio of the allowance for doubtful accounts for finance receivables was 371 as of december 30 2017  the allowance ratio was 353 while management believes it exercises prudent judgment and applies reasonable assumptions in establishing its estimate for the allowance for finance receivables there can be no assurance that changes in economic conditions or other factors would not adversely impact the financial health of our customers and result in changes to the estimates used in the allowance calculation for reference a 100 bps increase in the allowance ratio for finance receivables as of december 29 2018  would have increased snapon’s 2018  provision expense and related allowance for doubtful accounts by approximately 165 million 

for additional information on snapon’s allowances for doubtful accounts see note 1 and note 4 to the consolidated financial statements 

outlook 

snapon expects to make continued progress in 2019  along its defined runways for coherent growth leveraging capabilities already demonstrated in the automotive repair arena and developing and expanding its professional customer base not only in automotive repair but in adjacent markets additional geographies and other areas including extending in critical industries where the cost and penalties for failure can be high in pursuit of these initiatives snapon expects that capital expenditures in 2019  will be in a range of 90 million to 100 million 

snapon currently anticipates that its full year 2019  effective income tax rate will be comparable to its full year 2018  effective tax rate of 240 








 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

market credit and economic risks 

market risk is the potential economic loss that may result from adverse changes in the fair value of financial instruments snapon is exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates snapon is also exposed to market risk associated with the stockbased portion of its deferred compensation plans snapon monitors its exposure to these risks and attempts to manage the underlying economic exposures through the use of financial instruments such as foreign currency forward contracts interest rate swap agreements treasury lock agreements and prepaid equity forward agreements “equity forwards” snapon does not use derivative instruments for speculative or trading purposes snapon’s broadbased business activities help to reduce the impact that volatility in any particular area or related areas may have on its operating earnings as a whole snapon’s management takes an active role in the risk management process and has developed policies and procedures that require specific administrative and business functions to assist in the identification assessment and control of various risks 

foreign currency risk management 

snapon has significant international operations and is subject to certain risks inherent with foreign operations that include currency fluctuations foreign currency exchange risk exists to the extent that snapon has payment obligations or receipts denominated in currencies other than the functional currency including intercompany loans denominated in foreign currencies to manage these exposures snapon identifies naturally offsetting positions and then purchases hedging instruments to protect the residual net exposures see note 11 to the consolidated financial statements for information on foreign currency risk management 

interest rate risk management 

snapon aims to control funding costs by managing the exposure created by the differing maturities and interest rate structures of snapon’s borrowings through the use of interest rate swap agreements treasury lock agreements are used from time to time to manage the potential change in interest rates in anticipation of the possible issuance of fixed rate debt see note 11 to the consolidated financial statements for information on interest rate risk management 

snapon utilizes a valueatrisk “var” model to determine the potential oneday loss in the fair value of its interest rate and foreign exchangesensitive financial instruments from adverse changes in market factors the var model estimates were made assuming normal market conditions and a 95 confidence level snapon’s computations are based on the interrelationships among movements in various currencies and interest rates variancecovariance technique these interrelationships were determined by observing interest rate and foreign currency market changes over the preceding quarter 

the estimated maximum potential oneday loss in fair value calculated using the var model as of 2018  and 2017  year end was 77 million and 15 million respectively on interest ratesensitive financial instruments and zero and 01 million respectively on foreign currencysensitive financial instruments the var model is a risk management tool and does not purport to represent actual losses in fair value that will be incurred by snapon nor does it consider the potential effect of favorable changes in market factors 

stockbased deferred compensation risk management 

snapon aims to manage market risk associated with the stockbased portion of its deferred compensation plans through the use of equity forwards equity forwards are used to aid in offsetting the potential marktomarket effect on stockbased deferred compensation from changes in snapon’s stock price since stockbased deferred compensation liabilities increase as the company’s stock price rises and decrease as the company’s stock price declines the equity forwards are intended to mitigate the potential impact on compensation expense that may result from such marktomarket changes see note 11 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on stockbased deferred compensation risk management 

credit risk 

credit risk is the possibility of loss from a customer’s failure to make payments according to contract terms prior to extending credit each customer is evaluated taking into consideration various factors including the customer’s financial condition debtservicing ability past payment experience credit bureau information and other financial and qualitative factors that may affect the customer’s ability to repay as well as the value of the underlying collateral financial receivable credit risk is also monitored regularly through the use of internal proprietary custom scoring models to evaluate each transaction at the time of the application for credit snapon evaluates credit quality through the use of an internal proprietary measuring system that provides a framework to analyze finance receivables on the basis of risk factors of the individual obligor as well as transaction specific risk the finance receivables are typically monitored through an asset quality review process that closely monitors past due accounts and initiates a progressive collection action process when appropriate 





counterparty risk 

snapon is exposed to credit losses in the event of nonperformance by the counterparties to its various financial agreements including its foreign currency forward contracts interest rate swap agreements treasury lock agreements and prepaid equity forward agreements snapon does not obtain collateral or other security to support financial instruments subject to credit risk but monitors the credit standing of the counterparties and generally enters into agreements with financial institution counterparties with a credit rating of a or better snapon does not anticipate nonperformance by its counterparties but cannot provide assurances 

economic risk 

economic risk is the possibility of loss resulting from economic instability in certain areas of the world snapon continually monitors its exposure in these markets for example the company is monitoring the potential effects of the united kingdom’s pending exit from the european union although it is too soon to know what effects this might have on the world economy or the company inflation has not had a significant impact on the company 

as a result of the above market credit and economic risks net earnings and revenues in any particular period may not be representative of fullyear results and may vary significantly from year to year 

commodity risk 

snapon is a purchaser of certain commodities such as steel natural gas and electricity the company is also a purchaser of components and parts that are integrated into the company’s end products as well as the purchaser of certain finished goods all of which may contain various commodities including steel aluminum nickel copper and others snapon’s supply of raw materials and purchased components are generally and readily available from numerous suppliers 

the principal raw material used in the manufacture of the company’s products is steel which the company purchases in competitive pricesensitive markets to meet snapon’s high quality standards the company’s steel needs range from specialized alloys which are available only from a limited group of approved suppliers to common alloys which are available from multiple suppliers these raw materials have historically exhibited price and demand cyclicality some of these materials have been and in the future may be in short supply particularly in the event of mill shutdowns or production cut backs as some steel alloys require specialized manufacturing procedures snapon could experience inventory shortages if it were required to use an alternative manufacturer on short notice additionally price increases for raw materials including as a result of tariffs and other trade protection measures put in place by the united states or other countries such as those the company experienced in fiscal 2018 and expects to continue to experience in fiscal 2019 could result in higher prices to snapon’s customers or an erosion of the margins on its products 

snapon believes its ability to sell product is also dependent on the number of vehicles on the road the number of miles driven and the general aging of vehicles these factors affect the frequency type and amount of service and repair performed on vehicles by technicians and therefore affect the demand for the number of technicians the prosperity of the technicians and consequently the demand technicians have for the company’s tools other products and services and the value technicians place on those products and services the use of other methods of transportation including more frequent use of public transportation could result in a decrease in the use of privately operated vehicles a decrease in the use of privately operated vehicles may lead to fewer repairs and less demand for the company’s products 

to the extent that commodity prices increase and the company does not have firm pricing agreements with its suppliers the company may experience margin declines to the extent that it is not able to increase the selling prices of its products

distribution channels 

snapon serves customers primarily through the following channels of distribution i the mobile van channel ii company direct sales iii distributors and iv ecommerce the following discussion summarizes snapon’s general approach for each channel and is not intended to be allinclusive 

mobile van channel 

in the united states a significant portion of sales to the vehicle service and repair sector is conducted through snapon’s mobile franchise van channel snapon’s franchisees primarily serve vehicle repair technicians and vehicle service shop owners generally providing weekly contact at the customer’s place of business franchisees’ sales are concentrated in hand and power tools tool storage products shop equipment and diagnostic and repair information products which can easily be transported in a van or trailer and demonstrated during a brief sales call franchisees purchase snapon’s products at a discount from suggested list prices and resell them at prices established by the franchisee us franchisees are provided a list of calls that serves as the basis of the franchisee’s sales route snapon’s franchisees also have the opportunity to add a limited number of additional franchises 

snapon charges nominal initial and ongoing monthly franchise fees franchise fee revenue including nominal nonrefundable initial and ongoing monthly fees primarily for sales and business training and marketing and product promotion programs is recognized as the fees are earned franchise fee revenue totaled 152 million 139 million and 127 million in fiscal 2017 2016 and 2015 respectively 

snapon also has a companyowned route program that is designed to i provide another pool of potential field organization personnel ii service customers in select new andor open routes not currently serviced by franchisees and iii allow snapon to pilot new sales and promotional ideas prior to introducing them to franchisees as of 2017 year end companyowned routes comprised less than 3 of the total route population snapon may elect to increase or reduce the number of companyowned routes in the future 

in addition to its mobile van channel in the united states snapon has replicated its us franchise distribution model in certain other countries including the united kingdom canada japan australia germany netherlands south africa new zealand belgium and ireland in many of these markets as in the united states purchase decisions are generally made or influenced by professional vehicle service technicians as well as repair shop owners and managers as of 2017 year end snapon’s worldwide route count was approximately 4900 including approximately 3500 routes in the united states

company direct sales 

a significant proportion of shop equipment sales in north america under the john bean hofmann blackhawk caroliner challenger and procut brands diagnostic products under the snapon brand and information products under the mitchell1 brand are made by direct and independent sales forces that have responsibility for national and other accounts as the vehicle service and repair sector consolidates with more business conducted by national chains and franchised service centers snapon believes these larger organizations can be serviced most effectively by sales people who can demonstrate and sell the full line of diagnostic and equipment products and services snapon also sells these products and services directly to oems and their franchised dealers 

  

 

 

  

 

  

snapon brand tools and equipment are marketed to industrial and governmental customers worldwide through both industrial sales associates and independent distributors selling activities focus on industrial customers whose main purchase criteria are quality and integrated solutions as of 2017 year end snapon had industrial sales associates and independent distributors primarily in the united states and in various european latin american middle eastern asian and african countries with the united states representing the majority of snapon’s total industrial sales

competition 

snapon competes on the basis of its product quality and performance product line breadth and depth service brand awareness and imagery technological innovation and availability of financing through soc or its international finance subsidiaries while snapon does not believe that any single company competes with it across all of its product lines and distribution channels various companies compete in one or more product categories andor distribution channels 

snapon believes it is a leading manufacturer and distributor of professional tools tool storage diagnostic and equipment products and repair software and solutions offering a broad line of these products to both vehicle service and industrial marketplaces various competitors target and sell to professional technicians in the vehicle service and repair sector through the mobile tool distribution channel snapon also competes with companies that sell tools and equipment to vehicle service and repair technicians online and through retail stores vehicle parts supply outlets and tool supply warehousesdistributorships within the power tools category and the industrial sector snapon has various other competitors including companies with offerings that overlap with other areas discussed herein major competitors selling diagnostics shop equipment and information to vehicle dealerships and independent repair shops include oems and their proprietary electronic parts catalogs and diagnostics and information systems and other companies that offer products serving this sector

working capital 

most of snapon’s businesses are not seasonal and their inventory needs are relatively constant snapon did not have a significant backlog of orders at 2017 year end in recent years snapon has been using its working capital to fund in part the continued growth of the company’s financial services portfolio and the acquisitions discussed above 

snapon’s liquidity and capital resources and use of working capital are discussed herein in “part ii item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations”

 item 1a risk factors 

in evaluating the company careful consideration should be given to the following risk factors in addition to the other information included in this annual report on form 10k including the consolidated financial statements and the related notes each of these risk factors could adversely affect the company’s business operating results cash flows andor financial condition as well as adversely affect the value of an investment in the company’s common stock 

economic conditions and world events could affect our operating results 

we our franchisees and our customers may be adversely affected by changing economic conditions including conditions that may particularly impact specific regions these conditions may result in reduced consumer and investor confidence instability in the credit and financial markets volatile corporate profits and reduced business and consumer spending we our franchisees and our customers and the economy as a whole also may be affected by future world or local events outside our control such as acts of terrorism developments in the war on terrorism conflicts in international situations weather events and natural disasters as well as governmentrelated developments or issues these factors may affect our results of operations by reducing our sales margins andor net earnings as a result of a slowdown in customer orders or order cancellations impact the availability of raw materials andor the supply chain and could potentially lead to future impairment of our intangible assets in addition political and social turmoil related to international conflicts and terrorist acts may put pressure on economic conditions abroad unstable political social and economic conditions may make it difficult for our franchisees customers suppliers and us to accurately forecast and plan future business activities if such conditions persist our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows could be negatively affected 

in june 2016 the united kingdom voted in a referendum to exit the european union “brexit” which resulted in significant currency exchange rate fluctuations and volatility negotiations are underway to determine the terms of brexit given the lack of comparable precedent and the status of the negotiations the implications of brexit or how such implications might affect snapon continue to remain unclear at this time brexit could among other impacts disrupt trade and the movement of goods services and people between the united kingdom and the european union or other countries as well as create legal and global economic uncertainty these and other potential implications could adversely affect our business and results of operations 

in 2017 canada mexico and the united states commenced negotiations to potentially modify the terms of the north american free trade agreement “nafta” it is difficult to predict what if any changes will be made to nafta as a result of these negotiations if the us were to withdraw from nafta or if significant changes are made that among other impacts disrupt trade and the movement of goods and services between these countries it could have a material adverse impact on our business 

these and other matters significantly impacting the regulation of trade could adversely affect our business and results of operations 

  

 

 

  

 

  

raw material and energy price fluctuations and shortages including steel and various fuel sources could adversely affect the ability to obtain needed manufacturing materials and could adversely affect our results of operations 

the principal raw material used in the manufacture of our products is steel which we purchase in competitive pricesensitive markets to meet snapon’s high quality standards our steel needs range from specialized alloys which are available only from a limited group of approved suppliers to commodity types of alloys these raw materials have historically exhibited price and demand cyclicality some of these materials have been and in the future may be in short supply particularly in the event of mill shutdowns or production cut backs as some steel alloys require specialized manufacturing procedures we could experience inventory shortages if we were required to use an alternative manufacturer on short notice additionally unexpected price increases for raw materials could result in higher prices to our customers or an erosion of the margins on our products 

we believe our ability to sell our products is also dependent on the number of vehicles on the road the number of miles driven and the general aging of vehicles these factors affect the frequency type and amount of service and repair performed on vehicles by technicians and therefore affect the demand for the number of technicians the prosperity of technicians and consequently the demand technicians have for our tools other products and services and the value technicians place on those products and services the use of other methods of transportation including more frequent use of public transportation could result in a decrease in the use of privately operated vehicles a decrease in the use of privately operated vehicles may lead to fewer repairs and less demand for our products 

we use various energy sources to transport produce and distribute products and some of our products have components that are petroleum based petroleum and energy prices have periodically increased significantly over short periods of time future volatility and changes may be caused by market fluctuations supply and demand currency fluctuations production and transportation disruptions world events and changes in governmental programs energy price increases raise both our operating costs and the costs of our materials and we may not be able to increase our prices enough to offset these costs higher prices also may reduce the level of future customer orders and our profitability 

the performance of snapon’s mobile tool distribution business depends on the success of its franchisees 

approximately 41 of our consolidated net revenues in 2017 were generated by the snapon tools group which consists of snapon’s business operations primarily serving vehicle service and repair technicians through the company’s worldwide mobile tool distribution channel snapon’s success is dependent on its relationships with franchisees individually and collectively as they are the primary sales and service link between the company and vehicle service and repair technicians who are an important class of end users for snapon’s products and services if our franchisees are not successful or if we do not maintain an effective relationship with our franchisees the delivery of products the collection of receivables andor our relationship with end users could be adversely affected and thereby negatively impact our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

in addition if we are unable to maintain effective relationships with franchisees snapon or the franchisees may choose to terminate the relationship which may result in i open routes in which enduser customers are not provided reliable service ii litigation resulting from termination iii reduced collections or increased writeoffs of franchisee receivables owed to snapon andor iv reduced collections or increased writeoffs of finance and contract receivables 

exposure to credit risks of customers and resellers may make it difficult to collect receivables and could adversely affect operating results and financial condition 

the size of our financial services portfolio has increased significantly in recent years a decline in industry andor economic conditions could have the potential to weaken the financial position of some of our customers if circumstances surrounding our customers’ ability to repay their credit obligations were to deteriorate and result in the writedown or writeoff of such receivables it would negatively affect our operating results for the period in which they occur and if large could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

  

 

 

  

 

  

our inability to provide acceptable financing alternatives to enduser customers and franchisees could adversely impact our operating results 

an integral component of our business and profitability is our ability to offer competitive financing alternatives to enduser customers and franchisees the lack of our ability to offer such alternatives or obtain capital resources or other financing to support our receivables on terms that we believe are attractive whether resulting from the state of the financial markets our own operating performance or other factors would negatively affect our operating results and financial condition adverse fluctuations in interest rates andor our ability to provide competitive financing programs could also have an adverse impact on our revenue and profitability 

changes to legislation and regulations may affect our business reputation results of operations and financial condition 

significant changes to legislative and regulatory activity and compliance burdens including those associated with sales to our government military and defense contractor customers as well as the manner in which they are applied could significantly impact our business and the economy as a whole 

financial services businesses of all kinds are subject to significant and complex regulations and enforcement in addition to potentially increasing the costs of doing business due to compliance obligations new laws and regulations or changes to existing laws and regulations as well as the enforcement thereof may affect the relationships between creditors and debtors inhibit the rights of creditors to collect amounts owed to them expand liability for certain actions or inactions or limit the types of financial products or services offered any or all of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows failure to comply with any of these laws or regulations could also result in civil criminal monetary andor nonmonetary penalties damage to our reputation andor the incurrence of remediation costs 

snapon’s results of operations could also be affected by changes in the company’s effective tax rate as a result of changes in statutory tax rates laws and regulations as well as related guidance the company is currently analyzing the impact of the december 2017 passage of “hr1” formerly known as the tax cuts and jobs act in the united states the “tax act” which made significant changes to the us tax code and affects among other items the company’s tax rate previously unremitted foreign earnings and valuations of deferred tax assets and liabilities if new guidance is issued on the recently enacted tax revisions depending on the circumstances this and other tax legislation could adversely affect our results of operations 

these developments and other potential future legislation and regulations as well as the factors in the strict regulatory environment including the growing international regulation of privacy rights may also adversely affect the customers to which and the markets into which we sell our products and increase our costs and otherwise negatively affect our business reputation results of operations and financial condition including in ways that cannot yet be foreseen 

failure to achieve expected investment returns on pension plan assets as well as changes in interest rates or plan demographics could adversely impact our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

snapon sponsors various defined benefit pension plans the “pension plans” the assets of the pension plans are diversified in an attempt to mitigate the risk of a large loss required funding for the company’s domestic defined benefit pension plans is determined in accordance with guidelines set forth in the federal employee retirement income security act “erisa” foreign defined benefit pension plans are funded in accordance with local statutes or practice additional contributions to enhance the funded status of the pension plans can be made at the company’s discretion however there can be no assurance that the value of the pension plan assets or the investment returns on those plan assets will be sufficient to meet the future benefit obligations of such plans in addition during periods of adverse investment market conditions and declining interest rates the company may be required to make additional cash contributions to the pension plans that could reduce our financial flexibility changes in plan demographics including an increase in the number of retirements or changes in life expectancy assumptions may also increase the costs and funding requirements of the obligations related to the company’s pension plans 

  

 

 

  

 

  

our pension plan obligations are affected by changes in market interest rates significant fluctuations in market interest rates have added and may further add volatility to our pension plan obligations in periods of declining market interest rates our pension plan obligations generally increase in periods of increasing market interest rates our pension plan obligations generally decrease while our plan assets are broadly diversified there are inherent market risks associated with investments if adverse market conditions occur our plan assets could incur significant or material losses since we may need to make additional contributions to address changes in obligations andor a loss in plan assets the combination of declining market interest rates past or future plan asset investment losses andor changes in plan demographics could adversely impact our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

the company’s pension plan expense is comprised of the following factors i service cost ii interest on projected benefit obligations iii expected return on plan assets iv the amortization of prior service costs and credits v effects of actuarial gains and losses and vi settlementcurtailment costs when applicable the accounting for pensions involves the estimation of a number of factors that are highly uncertain certain factors such as the interest on projected benefit obligations and the expected return on plan assets are impacted by changes in market interest rates and the value of plan assets a significant decrease in market interest rates and a decrease in the fair value of plan assets would increase net pension expense and may adversely affect the company’s future results of operations see note 11 to the consolidated financial statements for further information on the company’s pension plans 

adverse developments in the credit and financial markets could negatively impact the availability of credit that we and our customers need to operate our businesses 

we depend upon the availability of credit to operate our business including the financing of receivables from enduser customers that are originated by our financial services businesses our enduser customers franchisees and suppliers also require access to credit for their businesses at times world financial markets have been unstable and subject to uncertainty adverse developments in the credit and financial markets or unfavorable changes in snapon’s credit rating could negatively impact the availability of future financing and the terms on which it might be available to snapon its enduser customers franchisees and suppliers inability to access credit or capital markets or a deterioration in the terms on which financing might be available could have an adverse impact on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

increasing our financial leverage could affect our operations and profitability 

the maximum available credit under our multicurrency revolving credit facility is 700 million the company’s leverage ratio may affect both our availability of additional capital resources as well as our operations in several ways including 

 

     while we believe we will have the ability to service our debt and obtain additional resources in the future if and when needed that will depend upon our results of operations and financial position at the time the thencurrent state of the credit and financial markets and other factors that may be beyond our control therefore we cannot give assurances that credit will be available on terms that we consider attractive or at all if and when necessary or beneficial to us 

  

 

 

  

 

  

data security and information technology infrastructure and security are critical to supporting business objectives failure of our systems to operate effectively could adversely affect our business and reputation 

we depend heavily on information technology infrastructure to achieve our business objectives and to protect sensitive information and continually invest in improving such systems problems that impair or compromise this infrastructure including natural disasters power outages major network failures security breaches or malicious attacks or during system upgrades andor new system implementations could impede our ability to record or process orders manufacture and ship in a timely manner account for and collect receivables protect sensitive data of the company our customers our suppliers and business partners or otherwise carry on business in the normal course any such events if significant could cause us to lose customers andor revenue and could require us to incur significant expense to remediate including as a result of legal or regulatory claims or proceedings and could also damage our reputation while we have taken steps to maintain adequate data security and address these risks and uncertainties by implementing security technologies internal controls network and data center resiliency and redundancy and recovery processes as well as by securing insurance these measures may be inadequate 

in association with initiatives to better integrate business units rationalize operating footprint and improve responsiveness to franchisees and customers snapon is continually replacing and enhancing its global enterprise resource planning erp management information systems as we integrate implement and deploy new information technology processes and enhance our common information infrastructure across our global operations we could experience disruptions in our business that could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

failure to maintain effective distribution of products and services could adversely impact revenue gross margin and profitability 

we use a variety of distribution methods to sell our products and services successfully managing the interaction of our distribution efforts to reach various potential customer segments for our products and services is a complex process moreover since each distribution method has distinct risks costs and gross margins our failure to implement the most advantageous balance in the delivery model for our products and services could adversely affect our revenue and gross margins and therefore our profitability 

risks associated with the disruption of manufacturing operations could adversely affect profitability or competitive position 

we manufacture a significant portion of the products we sell any prolonged disruption in the operations of our existing manufacturing facilities whether due to technical or labor difficulties facility consolidation or closure actions lack of raw material or component availability destruction of or damage to any facility as a result of natural disasters weather events use and storage of hazardous materials acts of war sabotage or terrorism or other events or other reasons could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

the inability to continue to introduce new products that respond to customer needs and achieve market acceptance could result in lower revenues and reduced profitability 

sales from new products represent a significant portion of our net sales and are expected to continue to represent a significant component of our future net sales we may not be able to compete effectively unless we continue to enhance existing products or introduce new products to the marketplace in a timely manner product improvements and new product introductions require significant financial and other resources including significant planning design development and testing at the technological product and manufacturing process levels our competitors’ new products may beat our products to market be more effective with more features be less expensive than our products andor render our products obsolete any new products that we develop may not receive market acceptance or otherwise generate any meaningful net sales or profits for us relative to our expectations based on among other things existing and anticipated investments in manufacturing capacity and commitments to fund advertising marketing promotional programs and research and development 

  

 

 

  

 

  

the global tool equipment and diagnostics and repair information industries are competitive 

we face strong competition in all of our market segments price competition in our various industries is intense and pricing pressures from competitors and customers are increasing in general as a manufacturer and marketer of premium products and services the expectations of snapon’s customers and its franchisees are high and continue to increase any inability to maintain customer satisfaction could diminish snapon’s premium image and reputation and could result in a lessening of our ability to command premium pricing we expect that the level of competition will remain high in the future which could limit our ability to maintain or increase market share or profitability 

product liability claims and litigation could affect our business reputation financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

the products that we design andor manufacture andor the services we provide can lead to product liability claims or other legal claims being filed against us to the extent that plaintiffs are successful in showing that a defect in a product’s design manufacture or warnings led to personal injury or property damage or that our provision of services resulted in similar injury or damage we may be subject to claims for damages although we are insured for damages above a certain amount we bear the costs and expenses associated with defending claims including frivolous lawsuits and are responsible for damages up to the insurance retention amount in addition to claims concerning individual products as a manufacturer we can be subject to costs potential negative publicity and lawsuits related to product recalls which could adversely impact our results of operations and damage our reputation 

legal disputes could adversely affect our business reputation financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

from time to time we are subject to legal disputes that are being litigated andor settled in the ordinary course of business disputes or future lawsuits could result in the diversion of management’s time and attention away from business operations additionally negative developments with respect to legal disputes and the costs incurred in defending ourselves even if successful could have an adverse impact on the company and its reputation successful outcomes at trial or on appeal can never be assured adverse outcomes or settlements could also require us to pay damages potentially in excess of amounts reserved or incur liability for other remedies that could have a material adverse effect on our business reputation financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

failure to adequately protect intellectual property or claims of infringement could adversely affect our business reputation financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

intellectual property rights are an important and integral component of our business and failure to obtain or maintain adequate protection of our intellectual property rights for any reason could have a material adverse effect on our business we attempt to protect our intellectual property rights through a combination of patent trademark copyright and trade secret laws as well as licensing agreements and thirdparty nondisclosure and assignment agreements in addition we have been and in the future may be subject to claims of intellectual property infringement against us by third parties whether or not these claims have merit we could be required to expend significant resources in defense of those claims adverse determinations in a judicial or administrative proceeding could prevent us from manufacturing and selling our products prevent us from stopping others from manufacturing and selling competing products andor result in payments for damages in the event of an infringement claim we may also be required to spend significant resources to develop alternatives or obtain licenses which may not be available on reasonable terms or at all and may reduce our sales and disrupt our production failure to obtain or maintain adequate protection of our intellectual property rights for any reason could have a material adverse effect on our business 

  

 

 

  

 

  

foreign operations are subject to political economic currency exchange and other risks that could adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

approximately 32 of our revenues in 2017 were generated outside of the united states future growth rates and success of our business depends in large part on continued growth in our nonus operations including growth in emerging markets and critical industries numerous risks and uncertainties affect our nonus operations these risks and uncertainties include political economic and social instability such as acts of war civil disturbance or acts of terrorism local labor conditions changes in government policies and regulations including imposition or increases in withholding and other taxes on remittances and other payments by international subsidiaries as well as the exposure to liabilities under anticorruption laws in various countries such as the us foreign corrupt practices act currency volatility transportation delays or interruptions sovereign debt uncertainties and difficulties in enforcement of contract and intellectual property rights as well as natural disasters should the economic environment in our nonus markets deteriorate from current levels our results of operations and financial position could be materially impacted including as a result of the effects of potential impairment writedowns of goodwill andor other intangible assets related to these businesses 

the reporting currency for snapon’s consolidated financial statements is the us dollar certain of the company’s assets liabilities expenses and revenues are denominated in currencies other than the us dollar in preparing snapon’s consolidated financial statements those assets liabilities expenses and revenues are translated into us dollars at applicable exchange rates increases or decreases in exchange rates between the us dollar and other currencies affect the us dollar value of those items as reflected in the consolidated financial statements substantial fluctuations in the value of the us dollar could have a significant impact on the company’s financial condition and results of operations 

we are also affected by changes in inflation rates and interest rates additionally cash generated in nonus jurisdictions may be difficult to repatriate to the united states in a taxefficient manner our foreign operations are also subject to other risks and challenges such as the need to staff and manage diverse workforces respond to the needs of multiple national and international marketplaces and differing business climates and cultures in various countries 

we may not successfully integrate businesses we acquire which could have an adverse impact on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

the pursuit of growth through acquisitions including participation in joint ventures involves significant risks that could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows these risks include 

 

          the recognition of impairment charges on goodwill or other intangible assets would adversely impact our future financial condition and results of operations 

we have a substantial amount of goodwill and purchased intangible assets almost all of which are booked in the commercial  industrial group and in the repair systems  information group we are required to perform impairment tests on our goodwill and other intangibles annually or at any time when events occur that could impact the value of our business segments our determination of whether impairment has occurred is based on a comparison of each of our reporting units’ fair market value with its carrying value 

  

 

 

  

 

  

significant and unanticipated changes in circumstances such as significant and longterm adverse changes in business climate adverse actions by regulators unanticipated competition the loss of key customers andor changes in technology or markets could require a provision for impairment in a future period that could substantially impact our reported earnings and reduce our consolidated net worth and shareholders’ equity should the economic environment in these markets deteriorate our results of operations and financial position could be materially impacted including as a result of the effects of potential impairment writedowns of goodwill andor other intangible assets related to these businesses 

our operations expose us to the risk of environmental liabilities costs litigation and violations that could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and reputation 

certain of our operations are subject to environmental laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which they operate which impose limitations on the discharge of pollutants into the ground air and water and establish standards for the generation treatment use storage and disposal of hazardous wastes we must also comply with various health and safety regulations in the united states and abroad in connection with our operations failure to comply with any of these laws could result in civil and criminal monetary and nonmonetary penalties and damage to our reputation in addition we may incur costs related to remedial efforts or alleged environmental damage associated with past or current waste disposal practices we cannot provide assurance that our costs of complying with current or future environmental protection and health and safety laws will not exceed our estimates 

the inability to successfully defend claims from taxing authorities could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we conduct business in many countries which requires us to interpret the income tax laws and rulings in each of those taxing jurisdictions due to the subjectivity of tax laws between those jurisdictions as well as the subjectivity of factual interpretations our estimates of income tax liabilities may differ from actual payments or assessments claims from taxing authorities related to these differences could have an adverse impact on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

failure to attract and retain qualified personnel could lead to a loss of revenue andor profitability 

snapon’s success depends in part on the efforts and abilities of its senior management team and other key employees their skills experience and industry contacts significantly benefit our operations and administration the failure to attract and retain members of our senior management team and other key employees could have a negative effect on our operating results in addition transitions of important responsibilities to new individuals inherently include the possibility of disruptions to our business and operations which could negatively affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

the steps taken to restructure operations rationalize operating footprint lower operating expenses and achieve greater efficiencies in the supply chain could disrupt business 

we have taken steps in the past and expect to take additional steps in the future intended to improve customer service and drive further efficiencies and reduce costs some of which could be disruptive to our business these actions collectively across our operating groups are focused on the following 

 

         

 

 

  

 

  

a failure to succeed in the implementation of any or all of these actions could result in an inability to achieve our financial goals and could be disruptive to the business 

in addition any future reductions to headcount and other cost reduction measures may result in the loss of technical expertise and could adversely affect our research and development efforts as well as our ability to meet product development schedules efforts to reduce components of expense could result in the recording of charges for inventory and technologyrelated writeoffs workforce reduction costs or other charges relating to the consolidation or closure of facilities if we were to incur a substantial charge to further these efforts our earnings per share would be adversely affected in such period if we are unable to effectively manage our cost reduction and restructuring efforts our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows could be negatively affected

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

management overview 

references in this management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations to “organic sales” refer to sales from continuing operations calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america “gaap” excluding acquisitionrelated sales and the impact of foreign currency translation management evaluates the company’s sales performance based on organic sales growth which primarily reflects growth from the company’s existing businesses as a result of increased output customer base and geographic expansion new product development andor pricing and excludes sales contributions from acquired operations the company did not own as of the comparable prioryear reporting period the company’s organic sales disclosures also exclude the effects of foreign currency translation as foreign currency translation is subject to volatility that can obscure underlying business trends management believes that the nongaap financial measure of organic sales is meaningful to investors as it provides them with useful information to aid in identifying underlying growth trends in our businesses and facilitating comparisons of our sales performance with prior periods 

we believe our operating results in 2017 demonstrate snapon’s continued progress in providing repeatability and reliability to a wide range of professional customers performing critical tasks in workplaces of consequence leveraging capabilities already demonstrated in the automotive repair arena our “coherent growth” strategy focuses on developing and expanding our professional customer base not only in automotive repair but in adjacent markets additional geographies and other areas including in critical industries where the cost and penalties for failure can be high 

we also believe our 2017 operating results provide continued evidence that snapon’s value proposition of making work easier for serious professionals in workplaces of consequence is an ongoing strength as we move forward along our runways for coherent growth 

 

    our strategic priorities and plans for 2018 will continue to build on our snapon value creation processes – our suite of strategic principles and processes we employ every day designed to create value and employed in the areas of safety quality customer connection innovation and rapid continuous improvement “rapid continuous improvement” or “rci” we expect to continue to deploy these processes in our existing operations as well as into our newly acquired businesses 

snapon’s rci initiatives employ a structured set of tools and processes across multiple businesses and geographies intended to eliminate waste and improve operations savings from snapon’s rci initiatives reflect benefits from a wide variety of ongoing efficiency productivity and process improvements including savings generated from product design cost reductions improved manufacturing line setup and changeover practices lowercost sourcing initiatives and facility consolidations unless individually significant it is not practicable to disclose each rci activity that generated savings andor segregate rci savings embedded in sales volume increases 

our global financial services operations continue to serve a significant strategic role in offering financing options to our franchisees to their customers and to customers in other parts of our business we expect that our global financial services business which includes both snapon credit llc “soc” in the united states and our other international finance subsidiaries will continue to be a meaningful contributor to our operating earnings going forward 

snapon has significant international operations and is subject to risks inherent with foreign operations including foreign currency translation fluctuations

impact of the tax act 

on december 22 2017 the us government passed the tax act the tax act makes broad and complex changes to the us tax code including but not limited to i reducing the future us federal corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent ii requiring companies to pay a onetime transition tax on certain unremitted earnings of foreign subsidiaries and iii bonus depreciation that will allow for full expensing of qualified property 

the tax act also established new tax laws that will affect 2018 including but not limited to i the reduction of the us federal corporate tax rate discussed above ii a general elimination of us federal income taxes on dividends from foreign subsidiaries iii a new provision designed to tax global intangible lowtaxed income “gilti” iv the repeal of the domestic production activity deductions v limitations on the deductibility of certain executive compensation vi limitations on the use of foreign tax credits to reduce the us income tax liability and vii a new provision that allows a domestic corporation an immediate deduction for a portion of its foreign derived intangible income “fdii” 

the securities and exchange commission staff issued staff accounting bulletin “sab” 118 which provides guidance on accounting for the tax effects of the tax act sab 118 provides a measurement period that should not extend beyond one year from the tax act enactment date for companies to complete the related accounting under asc 740 accounting for income taxes  in accordance with sab 118 a company must reflect the income tax effects of those aspects of the tax act for which the accounting under asc 740 is complete to the extent that a company’s accounting for a certain income tax effect of the tax act is incomplete but it is able to determine a reasonable estimate it must record a provisional estimate in the financial statements if a company cannot determine a provisional estimate to be included in the financial statements it should continue to apply asc 740 on the basis of the provisions of the tax laws that were in effect immediately before the enactment of the tax act

the company’s accounting for certain elements of the tax act is incomplete however the company was able to make reasonable estimates of the effects and therefore recorded provisional estimates for these items in connection with its initial analysis of the impact of the tax act the company has recorded a provisional discrete net tax expense of 70 million in the period ended december 30 2017 this provisional estimate consists of a net expense of 137 million for the onetime transition tax and a net benefit of 67 million related to revaluation of deferred tax assets and liabilities caused by the new lower corporate tax rate to determine the transition tax the company must determine the amount of post1986 accumulated earnings and profits of the relevant subsidiaries as well as the amount of nonus income taxes paid on such earnings while the company was able to make a reasonable estimate of the transition tax it is continuing to gather additional information to more precisely compute the final amount likewise while the company was able to make a reasonable estimate of the impact of the reduction to the corporate tax rate it may be affected by other analyses related to the tax act including but not limited to the state tax effect of adjustments made to federal temporary differences due to the complexity of the new gilti tax rules the company is continuing to evaluate this provision of the tax act and the application of asc 740 under gaap the company is allowed to make an accounting policy choice to either 1 treat taxes due on future us inclusions in taxable income related to gilti as a currentperiod expense when incurred the “period cost method” or 2 factor in such amounts into a company’s measurement of its deferred taxes the “deferred method” the company’s selection of an accounting policy with respect to the new gilti tax rules is dependent on additional analysis and potential future modifications to existing structure which are not currently known accordingly the company has not made any adjustments related to potential gilti tax in our financial statements and have not made a policy decision regarding whether to record deferred taxes on gilti the company will continue to analyze the full effects of the tax act on its financial statements the impact of the tax act may differ from the current estimate possibly materially due to changes in interpretations and assumptions the company has made future guidance that may be issued and actions the company may take as a result of the law

snapon believes it has sufficient available cash and access to both committed and uncommitted credit facilities to cover its expected funding needs on both a shortterm and longterm basis snapon manages its aggregate shortterm borrowings so as not to exceed its availability under the revolving credit facility snapon believes that it can access shortterm debt markets predominantly through commercial paper issuances and existing lines of credit to fund its shortterm requirements and to ensure nearterm liquidity snapon regularly monitors the credit and financial markets and may take advantage of what it believes are favorable market conditions to issue longterm debt to further improve its liquidity and capital resources nearterm liquidity requirements for snapon include scheduled debt payments including the repayment of the 2019 notes as noted above the 2018 notes were repaid on january 16 2018 payments of interest and dividends funding to support new receivables originated by our financial services businesses capital expenditures working capital the funding of pension plans and funding for share repurchases and acquisitions if and as they arise snapon intends to make contributions of 97 million to its foreign pension plans and 24 million to its domestic pension plans in 2018 as required by law depending on market and other conditions snapon may make additional discretionary cash contributions to its pension plans in 2018 

snapon’s longterm financing strategy is to maintain continuous access to the debt markets to accommodate its liquidity needs including the use of commercial paper additional fixedterm debt andor securitizations

offbalancesheet arrangements 

except as included below in the section labeled “contractual obligations and commitments” and note 15 to the consolidated financial statements the company had no offbalancesheet arrangements as of 2017 year end 

contractual obligations and commitments 

a summary of snapon’s future contractual obligations and commitments as of 2017 year end are as follows 

 

 on january 16 2018 snapon repaid the 2018 notes included in “notes payable and current maturities of longterm debt” in the table above upon maturity with available cash and cash generated from issuances of commercial paper 

snapon intends to make contributions of 97 million to its foreign pension plans and 24 million to its domestic pension plans in 2018 as required by law depending on market and other conditions snapon may make additional discretionary cash contributions to its pension plans in 2018 snapon has not presented estimated pension and postretirement funding contributions in the table above as the funding can vary from year to year based on changes in the fair value of the plan assets and actuarial assumptions see note 11 and note 12 to the consolidated financial statements for information on the company’s benefit plans and payments 

due to the uncertainty of the timing of settlements with taxing authorities snapon is unable to make reasonably reliable estimates of the period of cash settlement of unrecognized tax benefits for its remaining uncertain tax liabilities as a result 77 million of unrecognized tax benefits have been excluded from the table above see note 8 to the consolidated financial statements for information on income taxes 

  

 

 

  

 

  

environmental matters 

snapon is subject to various federal state and local government requirements regulating the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment snapon’s policy is to comply with these requirements and the company believes that as a general matter its policies practices and procedures are properly designed to prevent unreasonable risk of environmental damage and of resulting financial liability in connection with its business some risk of environmental damage is however inherent in some of snapon’s operations and products as it is with other companies engaged in similar businesses 

snapon is and has been engaged in the handling manufacture use and disposal of many substances classified as hazardous or toxic by one or more regulatory agencies snapon believes that as a general matter its handling manufacture use and disposal of these substances are in accordance with environmental laws and regulations it is possible however that future knowledge or other developments such as improved capability to detect substances in the environment or increasingly strict environmental laws and standards and enforcement policies could bring into question the company’s handling manufacture use or disposal of these substances 

new accounting standards 

see note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for information on new accounting standards 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the consolidated financial statements and related notes contain information that is pertinent to management’s discussion and analysis the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america “gaap” requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period these estimates are generally based on historical experience current conditions and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily available from other sources as well as identifying and assessing our accounting treatment with respect to commitments and contingencies actual results could differ from those estimates 

in addition to the company’s significant accounting policies described in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements snapon considers the following policies and estimates to be the most critical in understanding the judgments that are involved in the preparation of the company’s consolidated financial statements and the uncertainties that could impact the company’s financial position results of operations and cash flows 

impairment of goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets are tested for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the assets might be impaired annual impairment tests are performed by the company in the second quarter of each year using information available as of fiscal april month end 

snapon evaluates the recoverability of goodwill by estimating the future discounted cash flows of the businesses to which the goodwill relates estimated cash flows and related goodwill are grouped at the reporting unit level the company has determined that its reporting units for testing goodwill impairment are its operating segments or components of an operating segment that constitute a business for which discrete financial information is available and for which segment management regularly reviews the operating results within its four reportable operating segments the company has identified 11 reporting units 

  

 

 

 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued 

 

 

 

  

snapon evaluates the recoverability of goodwill by utilizing an income approach that estimates the fair value of the future discounted cash flows of the reporting units to which the goodwill relates the future projections which are based on both past performance and the projections and assumptions used in the company’s operating plans are subject to change as a result of changing economic and competitive conditions this approach reflects management’s internal outlook at the reporting units which management believes provides the best determination of value due to management’s insight and experience with the reporting units significant estimates used by management in the discounted cash flows methodology include estimates of future cash flows based on expected growth rates price increases working capital levels expected benefits from rci initiatives and a weightedaverage cost of capital that reflects the specific risk profile of the reporting unit being tested the company’s methodologies for valuing goodwill are applied consistently on a yearoveryear basis the assumptions used in performing the second quarter 2017 impairment calculations were evaluated in light of thencurrent market and business conditions snapon continues to believe that the future discounted cash flow valuation model provides the most reasonable and meaningful fair value estimate based upon the reporting units’ projections of future operating results and cash flows and replicates how market participants would value the company’s reporting units in an orderly transaction 

in the event the fair value of a reporting unit is less than the carrying value including goodwill the company would then record an impairment charge based on the excess of a reporting units carrying amount over its fair value 

snapon also evaluates the recoverability of its indefinitelived trademarks by utilizing an income approach that estimates the fair value of the future discounted cash flows of each of its trademarks the future projections which are based on both past performance and the projections and assumptions used in the company’s operating plans are subject to change as a result of changing economic and competitive conditions significant estimates used by management in the discounted cash flows methodology include estimates of future cash flows based on expected growth and royalty rates expected synergies and a weightedaverage cost of capital that reflects the specific risk profile of the trademark being tested the company’s methodologies for valuing trademarks are applied consistently on a yearoveryear basis the assumptions used in performing the second quarter 2017 impairment calculations were evaluated in light of thencurrent market and business conditions snapon continues to believe that the future discounted cash flow valuation model provides the most reasonable and meaningful fair value estimate based upon the trademarks’ projected future cash flows and replicates how market participants would value the company’s trademarks in an orderly transaction 

inherent in fair value determinations are significant judgments and estimates including material assumptions about future revenue profitability and cash flows the company’s operational plans and its interpretation of current economic indicators should the operations of the businesses with which goodwill or other indefinitelived intangible assets are associated incur significant declines in profitability and cash flow due to significant and longterm deterioration in macroeconomic industry and market conditions the loss of key customers changes in technology or markets significant changes in key personnel or litigation a significant and sustained decrease in share price andor other events including effects from the sale or disposal of a reporting unit some or all of the recorded goodwill or other indefinitelived intangible assets could be subject to impairment and could result in a material adverse effect on snapon’s financial position or results of operations 

snapon completed its annual impairment testing of goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets in the second quarter of 2017 the results of which did not result in any impairment as of 2017 year end the company has no accumulated impairment losses although the company consistently uses the same methods in developing the assumptions and estimates underlying the fair value calculations such estimates are uncertain by nature and can vary from actual results in performing its annual impairment testing the company performed a sensitivity analysis on the material assumptions used in the discounted cash flow valuation models for each of its 11 reporting units based on the company’s second quarter 2017 impairment testing and assuming a hypothetical 10 decrease in the estimated fair values of each of its 11 reporting units the hypothetical fair value of each of the company’s 11 reporting units would have been greater than its carrying value see note 6 to the consolidated financial statements for further information about goodwill and other intangible assets 

pension benefits the pension benefit obligation and related pension expense are calculated in accordance with gaap and are impacted by certain actuarial assumptions changes in these assumptions are primarily influenced by factors outside of snapon’s control such as changes in economic conditions and can have a significant effect on the amounts reported in the financial statements snapon believes that the two most critical assumptions are i the expected return on plan assets and ii the assumed discount rate 

  

 

 

  

 

  

snapon’s domestic pension plans have a longterm investment horizon and a total return strategy that emphasizes a capital growth objective in 2017 the longterm investment performance objective for snapon’s domestic plans’ assets was to achieve net of expense returns that met or exceeded the 75 domestic expected return on plan assets assumption snapon uses a threeyear marketrelated value asset method of amortizing the difference between actual and expected returns on its domestic plans’ assets as of 2017 year end snapon’s domestic pension plans’ assets comprised approximately 86 of the company’s worldwide pension plan assets 

based on forwardlooking capital market expectations snapon selected an expected return on plan assets assumption for its us pension plans of 745 a decrease of 5 bps from 2017 to be used in determining pension expense for 2018 in estimating the domestic expected return on plan assets snapon utilizes a nominal returns forecasting method for each asset class future returns are estimated by identifying the premium of riskier asset classes over lower risk alternatives the methodology constructs expected returns using a “building block” approach to the individual components of total return these forecasts are stated in both nominal and real after inflation terms this process first considers the longterm historical return premium based on the longest set of data available for each asset class these premiums calculated using the geometric mean are then adjusted based on current relative valuation levels macroeconomic conditions and the expected alpha related to active investment management the asset return assumption is also adjusted by an implicit expense load for estimated administrative and investmentrelated expenses since asset allocation is a key determinant of expected investment returns the current and expected mix of plan assets are also considered when setting the assumption 

pension expense increases as the expected rate of return on plan assets decreases lowering the expected rate of return assumption for snapon’s domestic pension plans’ assets by 50 bps would have increased snapon’s 2017 domestic pension expense by approximately 50 million 

the objective of snapon’s discount rate assumption is to reflect the rate at which the pension benefits could be effectively settled in making this determination the company takes into account the timing and amount of benefits that would be available under the plans the domestic discount rate as of 2017 and 2016 year end was selected based on a cash flow matching methodology developed by the company’s outside actuaries and which incorporates a review of current economic conditions this methodology matches the plans’ yearly projected cash flows for benefits and service costs to those of hypothetical bond portfolios using highquality aa rated or better corporate bonds from either moody’s investors service or standard  poor’s credit rating agencies available at the measurement date this technique calculates bond portfolios that produce adequate cash flows to pay the plans’ projected yearly benefits and then selects the portfolio with the highest yield and uses that yield as the recommended discount rate 

the selection of the 39 weightedaverage discount rate for snapon’s domestic pension plans as of 2017 year end compared to 45 as of 2016 year end represents the single rate that produces the same present value of cash flows as the estimated benefit plan payments lowering snapon’s domestic discount rate assumption by 50 bps would have increased snapon’s 2017 domestic pension expense and projected benefit obligation by approximately 43 million and 713 million respectively as of 2017 year end snapon’s domestic projected benefit obligation comprised approximately 83 of snapon’s worldwide projected benefit obligation the weightedaverage discount rate for snapon’s foreign pension plans of 27 compared to 29 as of 2016 year end represents the single rate that produces the same present value of cash flows as the estimated benefit plan payments lowering snapon’s foreign discount rate assumption by 50 bps would have increased snapon’s 2017 foreign pension expense and projected benefit obligation by approximately 18 million and 244 million respectively 

actuarial gains and losses in excess of 10 percent of the greater of the projected benefit obligation or marketrelated value of assets are amortized on a straightline basis over the average remaining service period of active participants or over the average remaining life expectancy for plans with primarily inactive participants prior service costs and credits resulting from plan amendments are amortized in equal annual amounts over the average remaining service period of active participants or over the average remaining life expectancy for plans with primarily inactive participants 

to determine the 2018 net periodic benefit cost snapon is using weightedaverage discount rates for its domestic and foreign pension plans of 39 and 27 respectively and an expected return on plan assets for its domestic pension plans of 745 the expected returns on plan assets for foreign pension plans ranged from 19 and 61 as of 2017 year end the net change in these two key assumptions from those used in 2017 is expected to increase pension expense in 2018 other factors such as changes in plan demographics and discretionary contributions may further increase or decrease pension expense in 2018 see note 11 to the consolidated financial statements for further information on pension plans 

  

 

 

 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued 

 

 

 

  

allowances for doubtful accounts on finance and contract receivables the allowances for doubtful accounts on finance and contract receivables are maintained at levels management believes are adequate to cover probable losses inherent in snapon’s finance and contract receivables portfolios as of the measurement date the allowances represent management’s estimate of the losses inherent in the company’s receivables portfolios based on ongoing assessments and evaluations of collectability and historical loss experience determination of the proper level of allowances by portfolio requires management to exercise significant judgment about the timing frequency and severity of credit losses that could materially affect the provision for credit losses and as a result net earnings the allowances take into consideration numerous quantitative and qualitative factors that include receivable type historical loss experience loss migration delinquency trends collection experience current economic conditions and credit risk characteristics some of these factors are influenced by items such as the customers’ financial condition debtservicing ability past payment experience and credit bureau and proprietary snapon credit model information as well as the value of the underlying collateral changes in economic conditions and assumptions including the resulting credit quality metrics relative to the performance of the finance and contract receivables portfolios create uncertainty and could result in changes to both the allowances and provision for credit losses 

management utilizes established policies and procedures in an effort to ensure the estimates and assumptions are well controlled reviewed and consistently applied as of december 30 2017 the ratios of the allowances for doubtful accounts to finance and contract receivables the “allowance ratios” were 353 and 108 respectively as of december 31 2016 the respective allowance ratios were 334 and 103 while management believes it exercises prudent judgment and applies reasonable assumptions in establishing its estimates for allowances for finance and contract receivables there can be no assurance that changes in economic conditions or other factors would not adversely impact the financial health of our customers and result in changes to the estimates used in the allowance calculations for reference a 100 bps increase in the allowance ratios for both finance and contract receivables as of december 30 2017 would have increased snapon’s 2017 provision expense and related allowances for doubtful accounts by approximately 160 million and 42 million respectively 

for additional information on snapon’s allowances for doubtful accounts see note 1 and note 3 to the consolidated financial statements 

outlook 

snapon expects to make continued progress in 2018 along its defined runways for coherent growth leveraging capabilities already demonstrated in the automotive repair arena and developing and expanding its professional customer base not only in automotive repair but in adjacent markets additional geographies and other areas including extending in critical industries where the cost and penalties for failure can be high in pursuit of these initiatives snapon expects that capital expenditures in 2018 will be in a range of 90 million to 100 million 

as a result of the recently enacted tax act snapon currently anticipates that its full year 2018 effective income tax rate will be in the range of 24 to 25 this compares to a full year 2017 effective tax rate of 311 

  

 

 

  

 

  




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

market credit and economic risks 

market risk is the potential economic loss that may result from adverse changes in the fair value of financial instruments snapon is exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates snapon is also exposed to market risk associated with the stockbased portion of its deferred compensation plans snapon monitors its exposure to these risks and attempts to manage the underlying economic exposures through the use of financial instruments such as foreign currency forward contracts interest rate swap agreements treasury lock agreements and prepaid equity forward agreements “equity forwards” snapon does not use derivative instruments for speculative or trading purposes snapon’s broadbased business activities help to reduce the impact that volatility in any particular area or related areas may have on its operating earnings as a whole snapon’s management takes an active role in the risk management process and has developed policies and procedures that require specific administrative and business functions to assist in the identification assessment and control of various risks 

foreign currency risk management 

snapon has significant international operations and is subject to certain risks inherent with foreign operations that include currency fluctuations foreign currency exchange risk exists to the extent that snapon has payment obligations or receipts denominated in currencies other than the functional currency including intercompany loans denominated in foreign currencies to manage these exposures snapon identifies naturally offsetting positions and then purchases hedging instruments to protect the residual net exposures see note 10 to the consolidated financial statements for information on foreign currency risk management 

interest rate risk management 

snapon aims to control funding costs by managing the exposure created by the differing maturities and interest rate structures of snapon’s borrowings through the use of interest rate swap agreements treasury lock agreements are used from time to time to manage the potential change in interest rates in anticipation of the possible issuance of fixed rate debt see note 10 to the consolidated financial statements for information on interest rate risk management 

snapon utilizes a valueatrisk “var” model to determine the potential oneday loss in the fair value of its interest rate and foreign exchangesensitive financial instruments from adverse changes in market factors the var model estimates were made assuming normal market conditions and a 95 confidence level snapon’s computations are based on the interrelationships among movements in various currencies and interest rates variancecovariance technique these interrelationships were determined by observing interest rate and foreign currency market changes over the preceding quarter 

the estimated maximum potential oneday loss in fair value calculated using the var model as of 2017 and 2016 year end was 15 million and 04 million respectively on interest ratesensitive financial instruments and 01 million and 08 million respectively on foreign currencysensitive financial instruments the var model is a risk management tool and does not purport to represent actual losses in fair value that will be incurred by snapon nor does it consider the potential effect of favorable changes in market factors 

stockbased deferred compensation risk management 

snapon aims to manage market risk associated with the stockbased portion of its deferred compensation plans through the use of equity forwards equity forwards are used to aid in offsetting the potential marktomarket effect on stockbased deferred compensation from changes in snapon’s stock price since stockbased deferred compensation liabilities increase as the company’s stock price rises and decrease as the company’s stock price declines the equity forwards are intended to mitigate the potential impact on compensation expense that may result from such marktomarket changes see note 10 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on stockbased deferred compensation risk management 

  

 

 

  

 

  

credit risk 

credit risk is the possibility of loss from a customer’s failure to make payments according to contract terms prior to extending credit each customer is evaluated taking into consideration various factors including the customer’s financial condition debtservicing ability past payment experience credit bureau information and other financial and qualitative factors that may affect the customer’s ability to repay as well as the value of the underlying collateral credit risk is also monitored regularly through the use of internal proprietary custom scoring models to evaluate each transaction at the time of the application for credit and by periodically updating those credit scores for ongoing monitoring purposes snapon evaluates credit quality through the use of an internal proprietary measuring system that provides a framework to analyze finance and contract receivables on the basis of risk factors of the individual obligor as well as transaction specific risk the finance and contract receivables are typically monitored through an asset quality review process that closely monitors past due accounts and initiates a progressive collection action process when appropriate 

counterparty risk 

snapon is exposed to credit losses in the event of nonperformance by the counterparties to its various financial agreements including its foreign currency forward contracts interest rate swap agreements treasury lock agreements and prepaid equity forward agreements snapon does not obtain collateral or other security to support financial instruments subject to credit risk but monitors the credit standing of the counterparties and generally enters into agreements with financial institution counterparties with a credit rating of a or better snapon does not anticipate nonperformance by its counterparties but cannot provide assurances 

economic risk 

economic risk is the possibility of loss resulting from economic instability in certain areas of the world snapon continually monitors its exposure in these markets for example the company is monitoring the potential effects of the united kingdom’s pending exit from the european union although it is too soon to know what effects this might have on the world economy or the company inflation has not had a significant impact on the company 

as a result of the above market credit and economic risks net earnings and revenues in any particular period may not be representative of fullyear results and may vary significantly from year to year 

commodity risk 

snapon is a purchaser of certain commodities such as steel natural gas and electricity the company is also a purchaser of components and parts that are integrated into the company’s end products as well as the purchaser of certain finished goods all of which may contain various commodities including steel aluminum nickel copper and others snapon’s supply of raw materials and purchased components are generally and readily available from numerous suppliers 

the principal raw material used in the manufacture of the company’s products is steel which the company purchases in competitive pricesensitive markets to meet snapon’s high quality standards the company’s steel needs range from specialized alloys which are available only from a limited group of approved suppliers to commodity types of alloys these raw materials have historically exhibited price and demand cyclicality some of these materials have been and in the future may be in short supply particularly in the event of mill shutdowns or production cut backs as some steel alloys require specialized manufacturing procedures snapon could experience inventory shortages if it were required to use an alternative manufacturer on short notice additionally unexpected price increases for raw materials could result in higher prices to snapon’s customers or an erosion of the margins on its products 

snapon believes its ability to sell product is also dependent on the number of vehicles on the road the number of miles driven and the general aging of vehicles these factors affect the frequency type and amount of service and repair performed on vehicles by technicians and therefore affect the demand for the number of technicians the prosperity of the technicians and consequently the demand technicians have for the company’s tools other products and services and the value technicians place on those products and services the use of other methods of transportation including more frequent use of public transportation could result in a decrease in the use of privately operated vehicles a decrease in the use of privately operated vehicles may lead to fewer repairs and less demand for the company’s products 

to the extent that commodity prices increase and the company does not have firm pricing agreements with its suppliers the company may experience margin declines to the extent that it is not able to increase the selling prices of its products

sales and distribution 

snapon markets and distributes its products and related services principally to professional tool and equipment users around the world the two largest market sectors are the vehicle service and repair sector and the industrial sector 

vehicle service and repair sector 

the vehicle service and repair sector has three main customer groups i professional technicians who purchase tools and diagnostic and equipment products for use in their work ii other professional customers related to vehicle repair including owners and managers of independent repair shops and oem dealerships who purchase tools and diagnostic and equipment products for use by multiple technicians within a service or repair facility and iii oems

distribution channels 

snapon serves customers primarily through the following channels of distribution i the mobile van channel ii company direct sales iii distributors and iv ecommerce the following discussion summarizes snapon’s general approach for each channel and is not intended to be allinclusive 

mobile van channel 

in the united states a significant portion of sales to the vehicle service and repair sector is conducted through snapon’s mobile franchise van channel snapon’s franchisees primarily serve vehicle repair technicians and vehicle service shop owners generally providing weekly contact at the customer’s place of business franchisees’ sales are concentrated in hand and power tools tool storage products shop equipment and diagnostic and repair information products which can easily be transported in a van or trailer and demonstrated during a brief sales call franchisees purchase snapon’s products at a discount from suggested list prices and resell them at prices established by the franchisee us franchisees are provided a list of calls that serves as the basis of the franchisee’s sales route snapon’s franchisees also have the opportunity to add a limited number of additional franchises 

snapon charges nominal initial and ongoing monthly franchise fees franchise fee revenue including nominal nonrefundable initial and ongoing monthly fees primarily for sales and business training and marketing and product promotion programs is recognized as the fees are earned franchise fee revenue totaled 139 million 127 million and 121 million in fiscal 2016 2015 and 2014 respectively 

snapon also has a companyowned route program that is designed to i provide another pool of potential field organization personnel ii service customers in select new andor open routes not currently serviced by franchisees and iii allow snapon to pilot new sales and promotional ideas prior to introducing them to franchisees as of 2016 year end companyowned routes comprised less than 3 of the total route population snapon may elect to increase or reduce the number of companyowned routes in the future 

in addition to its mobile van channel in the united states snapon has replicated its us franchise distribution model in certain other countries including the united kingdom canada japan australia germany netherlands south africa new zealand belgium and ireland in many of these markets as in the united states purchase decisions are generally made or influenced by professional vehicle service technicians as well as repair shop owners and managers as of 2016 year end snapon’s worldwide route count was approximately 4900 including approximately 3500 routes in the united states

company direct sales 

a significant proportion of shop equipment sales in north america under the john bean hofmann blackhawk caroliner challenger and procut brands diagnostic products under the snapon brand and information products under the mitchell1 brand are made by direct and independent sales forces that have responsibility for national and other accounts as the vehicle service and repair sector consolidates with more business conducted by national chains and franchised service centers snapon believes these larger organizations can be serviced most effectively by sales people who can demonstrate and sell the full line of diagnostic and equipment products and services snapon also sells these products and services directly to oems and their franchised dealers 

  

 

 

  

 

  

snapon brand tools and equipment are marketed to industrial and governmental customers worldwide through both industrial sales associates and independent distributors selling activities focus on industrial customers whose main purchase criteria are quality and integrated solutions as of 2016 year end snapon had industrial sales associates and independent distributors primarily in the united states and in various european latin american middle eastern asian and african countries with the united states representing the majority of snapon’s total industrial sales 

snapon also sells software services and solutions to the automotive commercial heavy duty agriculture power equipment and power sports segments products and services are marketed to targeted groups including oems and their dealerships fleets and individual repair shops to effectively reach oems which frequently have a multinational presence snapon has deployed focused business teams globally 

distributors 

sales of certain tools and equipment are made through independent distributors who purchase the items from snapon and resell them to end users hand tools sold under the bahco fish and hook irimo lindström cdi ati sioux sturtevant richmont and williams brands and trade names for example are sold through distributors in europe north and south america asia and certain other parts of the world wheel service and other vehicle service equipment are sold through distributors primarily under brands including hofmann john bean caroliner challenger procut cartec blackhawk and ecotechnics diagnostic and equipment products are marketed through distributors in south america and asia and through both a direct sales force and distributors in europe under the snapon sun and bluepoint brands 

ecommerce 

snapon offers current and prospective customers online access to research and purchase products through its public website at www snaponcom  the site features an online catalog of snapon hand tools power tools tool storage units and diagnostic equipment available to customers in the united states the united kingdom canada and australia ecommerce and certain other system enhancement initiatives are designed to improve productivity and further leverage the oneonone relationships and service snapon has with its current and prospective customers sales through the company’s ecommerce distribution channel were not significant in any of the last three years 

competition 

snapon competes on the basis of its product quality and performance product line breadth and depth service brand awareness and imagery technological innovation and availability of financing through soc or its international finance subsidiaries while snapon does not believe that any single company competes with it across all of its product lines and distribution channels various companies compete in one or more product categories andor distribution channels 

snapon believes it is a leading manufacturer and distributor of professional tools tool storage diagnostic and equipment products and repair software and solutions offering a broad line of these products to both vehicle service and industrial marketplaces various competitors target and sell to professional technicians in the vehicle service and repair sector through the mobile tool distribution channel snapon also competes with companies that sell tools and equipment to vehicle service and repair technicians online and through retail stores vehicle parts supply outlets and tool supply warehousesdistributorships within the power tools category and the industrial sector snapon has various other competitors including companies with offerings that overlap with other areas discussed herein major competitors selling diagnostics shop equipment and information to vehicle dealerships and independent repair shops include oems and their proprietary electronic parts catalogs and diagnostics and information systems and other companies that offer products serving this sector 

raw materials and purchased product 

snapon’s supply of raw materials and purchased components are generally and readily available from numerous suppliers snapon believes it has secured an ample supply of both bar and coil steel for the near future to ensure stable supply to meet material demands the company does not currently anticipate experiencing any significant impact in 2017 from steel pricing or availability issues 

  

 

 

  

 

  

patents trademarks and other intellectual property 

snapon vigorously pursues and relies on patent protection to protect its intellectual property and position in its markets as of 2016 year end snapon and its subsidiaries held approximately 700 active and pending patents in the united states and approximately 1600 active and pending patents outside of the united states sales relating to any single patent did not represent a material portion of snapon’s revenues in any of the last three years 

examples of products that have features or designs that benefit from patent protection include wheel alignment systems wheel balancers tire changers vehicle lifts tool storage tool control collision measurement test lanes brake lathes sealed ratchets electronic torque instruments ratcheting screwdrivers emissionssensing devices and diagnostic equipment 

much of the technology used in the manufacture of vehicle service tools and equipment is in the public domain snapon relies primarily on trade secret protection to protect proprietary processes used in manufacturing methods and processes are patented when appropriate copyright protection is also utilized when appropriate 

trademarks used by snapon are of continuing importance to snapon in the marketplace trademarks have been registered in the united states and many other countries and additional applications for trademark registrations are pending snapon vigorously polices proper use of its trademarks snapon’s right to manufacture and sell certain products is dependent upon licenses from others however these products under license do not represent a material portion of snapon’s net sales 

domain names have become a valuable corporate asset for companies around the world including snapon domain names often contain a trademark or service mark or even a corporate name and are often considered intellectual property the recognition and value of the snapon name trademark and domain name are core strengths of the company 

snapon strategically licenses the snapon brand to carefully selected manufacturing and distribution companies for items such as apparel work boots lighting and a variety of other goods in order to further build brand awareness and market presence for the company’s strongest brand

snapon believes that it complies with applicable environmental control requirements in its operations expenditures on environmental matters through eh  sms have not had and snapon does not for the foreseeable future expect them to have a material effect upon snapon’s capital expenditures earnings or competitive position 

employees 

snapon employed approximately 12100 people at the end of january 2017 snapon employed approximately 11500 people at the end of january 2016 the yearoveryear increase in employees primarily reflects the caroliner and sturtevant richmont acquisitions 

approximately 2800 employees or 23 of snapon’s worldwide workforce are represented by unions andor covered under collective bargaining agreements the number of covered union employees whose contracts expire over the next five years approximates 2100 employees in 2017 500 employees in 2018 and 200 employees in 2019 there are no contracts currently scheduled to expire in 2020 or 2021 in recent years snapon has not experienced any significant work slowdowns stoppages or other labor disruptions 

there can be no assurance that these and other future contracts with snapon’s unions will be renegotiated upon terms acceptable to snapon 

  

 

 

  

 

  

working capital 

most of snapon’s businesses are not seasonal and their inventory needs are relatively constant snapon did not have a significant backlog of orders at 2016 year end in recent years snapon has been using its working capital to fund in part the continued growth of the company’s financial services portfolio and the acquisitions discussed above 

snapon’s liquidity and capital resources and use of working capital are discussed herein in “part ii item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations”

we our franchisees and our customers may be adversely affected by changing economic conditions including conditions that may particularly impact specific regions these conditions may result in reduced consumer and investor confidence instability in the credit and financial markets volatile corporate profits and reduced business and consumer spending we our franchisees and our customers and the economy as a whole also may be affected by future world or local events outside our control such as acts of terrorism developments in the war on terrorism conflicts in international situations and natural disasters as well as governmentrelated developments or issues these factors may affect our results of operations by reducing our sales margins andor net earnings as a result of a slowdown in customer orders or order cancellations impact the availability of raw materials andor the supply chain and could potentially lead to future impairment of our intangible assets in addition political and social turmoil related to international conflicts and terrorist acts may put pressure on economic conditions abroad unstable political social and economic conditions may make it difficult for our franchisees customers suppliers and us to accurately forecast and plan future business activities if such conditions persist our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows could be negatively affected 

in june 2016 the united kingdom voted in a referendum to exit the european union “brexit” which resulted in significant currency exchange rate fluctuations and volatility beginning late in the second quarter of fiscal 2016 subject to parliamentary approval the british government is expected to commence negotiations to determine the terms of brexit given the lack of comparable precedent the implications of brexit or how such implications might affect snapon are unclear at this time brexit could among other impacts disrupt trade and the movement of goods services and people between the united kingdom and the european union or other countries as well as create legal and global economic uncertainty these and other potential implications could adversely affect our business and results of operations 

raw material and energy price fluctuations and shortages including steel and various fuel sources could adversely affect the ability to obtain needed manufacturing materials and could adversely affect our results of operations 

the principal raw material used in the manufacture of our products is steel which we purchase in competitive pricesensitive markets to meet snapon’s high quality standards our steel needs range from specialized alloys which are available only from a limited group of approved suppliers to commodity types of alloys these raw materials have historically exhibited price and demand cyclicality some of these materials have been and in the future may be in short supply particularly in the event of mill shutdowns or production cut backs as some steel alloys require specialized manufacturing procedures we could experience inventory shortages if we were required to use an alternative manufacturer on short notice additionally unexpected price increases for raw materials could result in higher prices to our customers or an erosion of the margins on our products 

  

 

 

  

 

  

we believe our ability to sell our products is also dependent on the number of vehicles on the road the number of miles driven and the general aging of vehicles these factors affect the frequency type and amount of service and repair performed on vehicles by technicians and therefore affect the demand for the number of technicians the prosperity of technicians and consequently the demand technicians have for our tools other products and services and the value technicians place on those products and services the use of other methods of transportation including more frequent use of public transportation could result in a decrease in the use of privately operated vehicles a decrease in the use of privately operated vehicles may lead to fewer repairs and less demand for our products 

we use various energy sources to transport produce and distribute products and some of our products have components that are petroleum based petroleum and energy prices have periodically increased significantly over short periods of time future volatility and changes may be caused by market fluctuations supply and demand currency fluctuations production and transportation disruptions world events and changes in governmental programs energy price increases raise both our operating costs and the costs of our materials and we may not be able to increase our prices enough to offset these costs higher prices also may reduce the level of future customer orders and our profitability 

the performance of snapon’s mobile tool distribution business depends on the success of its franchisees 

approximately 44 of our consolidated net revenues in 2016 were generated by the snapon tools group which consists of snapon’s business operations primarily serving vehicle service and repair technicians through the company’s worldwide mobile tool distribution channel snapon’s success is dependent on its relationships with franchisees individually and collectively as they are the primary sales and service link between the company and vehicle service and repair technicians who are an important class of end users for snapon’s products and services if our franchisees are not successful or if we do not maintain an effective relationship with our franchisees the delivery of products the collection of receivables andor our relationship with end users could be adversely affected and thereby negatively impact our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

in addition if we are unable to maintain effective relationships with franchisees snapon or the franchisees may choose to terminate the relationship which may result in i open routes in which enduser customers are not provided reliable service ii litigation resulting from termination iii reduced collections or increased writeoffs of franchisee receivables owed to snapon andor iv reduced collections or increased writeoffs of finance and contract receivables 

exposure to credit risks of customers and resellers may make it difficult to collect receivables and could adversely affect operating results and financial condition 

the size of our financial services portfolio has increased significantly in recent years a decline in industry andor economic conditions could have the potential to weaken the financial position of some of our customers if circumstances surrounding our customers’ ability to repay their credit obligations were to deteriorate and result in the writedown or writeoff of such receivables it would negatively affect our operating results for the period in which they occur and if large could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

our inability to provide acceptable financing alternatives to enduser customers and franchisees could adversely impact our operating results 

an integral component of our business and profitability is our ability to offer competitive financing alternatives to enduser customers and franchisees the lack of our ability to offer such alternatives or obtain capital resources or other financing to support our receivables on terms that we believe are attractive whether resulting from the state of the financial markets our own operating performance or other factors would negatively affect our operating results and financial condition adverse fluctuations in interest rates andor our ability to provide competitive financing programs could also have an adverse impact on our revenue and profitability 

new stricter andor changed legislation and regulations may affect our business reputation results of operations and financial condition 

increased legislative and regulatory activity and compliance burdens including those associated with sales to our government military and defense contractor customers as well as a more stringent manner in which they are applied could significantly impact our business and the economy as a whole 

  

 

 

  

 

  

financial services businesses of all kinds are subject to increasing regulation and enforcement in addition to potentially increasing the costs of doing business due to compliance obligations new laws and regulations or changes to existing laws and regulations as well as the enforcement thereof may affect the relationships between creditors and debtors inhibit the rights of creditors to collect amounts owed to them expand liability for certain actions or inactions or limit the types of financial products or services offered any or all of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows failure to comply with any of these laws or regulations could also result in civil criminal monetary andor nonmonetary penalties damage to our reputation andor the incurrence of remediation costs 

these developments and other potential future legislation and regulations as well as the increasingly strict regulatory environment including the growing international regulation of privacy rights may also adversely affect the customers to which and the markets into which we sell our products and increase our costs and otherwise negatively affect our business reputation results of operations and financial condition including in ways that cannot yet be foreseen 

failure to achieve expected investment returns on pension plan assets as well as changes in interest rates or plan demographics could adversely impact our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

snapon sponsors various defined benefit pension plans the “pension plans” the assets of the pension plans are diversified in an attempt to mitigate the risk of a large loss required funding for the company’s domestic defined benefit pension plans is determined in accordance with guidelines set forth in the federal employee retirement income security act “erisa” foreign defined benefit pension plans are funded in accordance with local statutes or practice additional contributions to enhance the funded status of the pension plans can be made at the company’s discretion however there can be no assurance that the value of the pension plan assets or the investment returns on those plan assets will be sufficient to meet the future benefit obligations of such plans in addition during periods of adverse investment market conditions and declining interest rates the company may be required to make additional cash contributions to the pension plans that could reduce our financial flexibility changes in plan demographics including an increase in the number of retirements or changes in life expectancy assumptions may also increase the costs and funding requirements of the obligations related to the company’s pension plans 

our pension plan obligations are affected by changes in market interest rates significant fluctuations in market interest rates have added and may further add volatility to our pension plan obligations in periods of declining market interest rates our pension plan obligations generally increase in periods of increasing market interest rates our pension plan obligations generally decrease while our plan assets are broadly diversified there are inherent market risks associated with investments if adverse market conditions occur our plan assets could incur significant or material losses since we may need to make additional contributions to address changes in obligations andor a loss in plan assets the combination of declining market interest rates past or future plan asset investment losses andor changes in plan demographics could adversely impact our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

the company’s pension plan expense is comprised of the following factors i service cost ii interest on projected benefit obligations iii expected return on plan assets iv the amortization of prior service costs and credits v effects of actuarial gains and losses and vi settlementcurtailment costs when applicable the accounting for pensions involves the estimation of a number of factors that are highly uncertain certain factors such as the interest on projected benefit obligations and the expected return on plan assets are impacted by changes in market interest rates and the value of plan assets a significant decrease in market interest rates and a decrease in the fair value of plan assets would increase net pension expense and may adversely affect the company’s future results of operations see note 11 to the consolidated financial statements for further information on the company’s pension plans 

adverse developments in the credit and financial markets could negatively impact the availability of credit that we and our customers need to operate our businesses 

we depend upon the availability of credit to operate our business including the financing of receivables from enduser customers that are originated by our financial services businesses our enduser customers franchisees and suppliers also require access to credit for their businesses at times in recent years world financial markets have been unstable and subject to uncertainty adverse developments in the credit and financial markets or unfavorable changes in snapon’s credit rating could negatively impact the availability of future financing and the terms on which it might be available to snapon its enduser customers franchisees and suppliers inability to access credit or capital markets or a deterioration in the terms on which financing might be available could have an adverse impact on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

  

 

 

  

 

  

increasing our financial leverage could affect our operations and profitability 

the maximum available credit under our multicurrency revolving credit facility is 700 million the company’s leverage ratio may affect both our availability of additional capital resources as well as our operations in several ways including 

 

     while we believe we will have the ability to service our debt and obtain additional resources in the future if and when needed that will depend upon our results of operations and financial position at the time the thencurrent state of the credit and financial markets and other factors that may be beyond our control therefore we cannot give assurances that credit will be available on terms that we consider attractive or at all if and when necessary or beneficial to us 

data security and information technology infrastructure and security are critical to supporting business objectives failure of our systems to operate effectively could adversely affect our business and reputation 

we depend heavily on information technology infrastructure to achieve our business objectives and to protect sensitive information and continually invest in improving such systems problems that impair or compromise this infrastructure including due to natural disasters power outages major network failures security breaches or malicious attacks or during system upgrades andor new system implementations could impede our ability to record or process orders manufacture and ship in a timely manner account for and collect receivables protect sensitive data of the company our customers our suppliers and business partners or otherwise carry on business in the normal course any such events if significant could cause us to lose customers andor revenue and could require us to incur significant expense to remediate including as a result of legal or regulatory claims or proceedings and could also damage our reputation while we have taken steps to maintain adequate data security and address these risks and uncertainties by implementing security technologies internal controls network and data center resiliency and redundancy and recovery processes as well as by securing insurance these measures may be inadequate 

in association with initiatives to better integrate business units rationalize operating footprint and improve responsiveness to franchisees and customers snapon is continually replacing and enhancing its global enterprise resource planning erp management information systems as we integrate implement and deploy new information technology processes and enhance our common information infrastructure across our global operations we could experience disruptions in our business that could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

failure to maintain effective distribution of products and services could adversely impact revenue gross margin and profitability 

we use a variety of distribution methods to sell our products and services successfully managing the interaction of our distribution efforts to reach various potential customer segments for our products and services is a complex process moreover since each distribution method has distinct risks costs and gross margins our failure to implement the most advantageous balance in the delivery model for our products and services could adversely affect our revenue and gross margins and therefore our profitability 

risks associated with the disruption of manufacturing operations could adversely affect profitability or competitive position 

we manufacture a significant portion of the products we sell any prolonged disruption in the operations of our existing manufacturing facilities whether due to technical or labor difficulties facility consolidation or closure actions lack of raw material or component availability destruction of or damage to any facility as a result of natural disasters use and storage of hazardous materials or other events or other reasons could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

  

 

 

  

 

  

the inability to continue to introduce new products that respond to customer needs and achieve market acceptance could result in lower revenues and reduced profitability 

sales from new products represent a significant portion of our net sales and are expected to continue to represent a significant component of our future net sales we may not be able to compete effectively unless we continue to enhance existing products or introduce new products to the marketplace in a timely manner product improvements and new product introductions require significant financial and other resources including significant planning design development and testing at the technological product and manufacturing process levels our competitors’ new products may beat our products to market be more effective with more features be less expensive than our products andor render our products obsolete any new products that we develop may not receive market acceptance or otherwise generate any meaningful net sales or profits for us relative to our expectations based on among other things existing and anticipated investments in manufacturing capacity and commitments to fund advertising marketing promotional programs and research and development 

the global tool equipment and diagnostics and repair information industries are competitive 

we face strong competition in all of our market segments price competition in our various industries is intense and pricing pressures from competitors and customers are increasing in general as a manufacturer and marketer of premium products and services the expectations of snapon’s customers and its franchisees are high and continue to increase any inability to maintain customer satisfaction could diminish snapon’s premium image and reputation and could result in a lessening of our ability to command premium pricing we expect that the level of competition will remain high in the future which could limit our ability to maintain or increase market share or profitability 

product liability claims and litigation could affect our business reputation financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

the products that we design andor manufacture andor the services we provide can lead to product liability claims or other legal claims being filed against us to the extent that plaintiffs are successful in showing that a defect in a product’s design manufacture or warnings led to personal injury or property damage or that our provision of services resulted in similar injury or damage we may be subject to claims for damages although we are insured for damages above a certain amount we bear the costs and expenses associated with defending claims including frivolous lawsuits and are responsible for damages up to the insurance retention amount in addition to claims concerning individual products as a manufacturer we can be subject to costs potential negative publicity and lawsuits related to product recalls which could adversely impact our results of operations and damage our reputation 

legal disputes could adversely affect our business reputation financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

from time to time we are subject to legal disputes that are being litigated andor settled in the ordinary course of business disputes or future lawsuits could result in the diversion of management’s time and attention away from business operations additionally negative developments with respect to legal disputes and the costs incurred in defending ourselves could have an adverse impact on the company and its reputation adverse outcomes or settlements could also require us to pay damages potentially in excess of amounts reserved or incur liability for other remedies that could have a material adverse effect on our business reputation financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

failure to adequately protect intellectual property could adversely affect our business 

intellectual property rights are an important and integral component of our business we attempt to protect our intellectual property rights through a combination of patent trademark copyright and trade secret laws as well as licensing agreements and thirdparty nondisclosure and assignment agreements adverse determinations in a judicial or administrative proceeding could prevent us from manufacturing and selling our products or prevent us from stopping others from manufacturing and selling competing products failure to obtain or maintain adequate protection of our intellectual property rights for any reason could have a material adverse effect on our business 

  

 

 

  

 

  

foreign operations are subject to political economic currency exchange and other risks that could adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

approximately 30 of our revenues in 2016 were generated outside of the united states future growth rates and success of our business depends in large part on continued growth in our nonus operations including growth in emerging markets and critical industries numerous risks and uncertainties affect our nonus operations these risks and uncertainties include political economic and social instability such as acts of war civil disturbance or acts of terrorism local labor conditions changes in government policies and regulations including imposition or increases in withholding and other taxes on remittances and other payments by international subsidiaries as well as the exposure to liabilities under anticorruption laws in various countries such as the us foreign corrupt practices act currency volatility transportation delays or interruptions sovereign debt uncertainties and difficulties in enforcement of contract and intellectual property rights as well as natural disasters should the economic environment in our nonus markets deteriorate from current levels our results of operations and financial position could be materially impacted including as a result of the effects of potential impairment writedowns of goodwill andor other intangible assets related to these businesses 

the reporting currency for snapon’s consolidated financial statements is the us dollar certain of the company’s assets liabilities expenses and revenues are denominated in currencies other than the us dollar in preparing snapon’s consolidated financial statements those assets liabilities expenses and revenues are translated into us dollars at applicable exchange rates increases or decreases in exchange rates between the us dollar and other currencies affect the us dollar value of those items as reflected in the consolidated financial statements substantial fluctuations in the value of the us dollar could have a significant impact on the company’s financial condition and results of operations 

we are also affected by changes in inflation rates and interest rates additionally cash generated in nonus jurisdictions may be difficult to repatriate to the united states in a taxefficient manner our foreign operations are also subject to other risks and challenges such as the need to staff and manage diverse workforces respond to the needs of multiple national and international marketplaces and differing business climates and cultures in various countries 

we may not successfully integrate businesses we acquire which could have an adverse impact on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

the pursuit of growth through acquisitions including participation in joint ventures involves significant risks that could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows these risks include 

 

          the recognition of impairment charges on goodwill or other intangible assets would adversely impact our future financial condition and results of operations 

we have a substantial amount of goodwill and purchased intangible assets almost all of which are booked in the commercial  industrial group and in the repair systems  information group we are required to perform impairment tests on our goodwill and other intangibles annually or at any time when events occur that could impact the value of our business segments our determination of whether impairment has occurred is based on a comparison of each of our reporting units’ fair market value with its carrying value significant and unanticipated changes in circumstances such as significant and longterm adverse changes in business climate adverse actions by regulators unanticipated competition the loss of key customers andor changes in technology or markets could require a provision for impairment in a future period that could substantially impact our reported earnings and reduce our consolidated net worth and shareholders’ equity should the economic environment in these markets deteriorate our results of operations and financial position could be materially impacted including as a result of the effects of potential impairment writedowns of goodwill andor other intangible assets related to these businesses 

  

 

 

  

 

  

our operations expose us to the risk of environmental liabilities costs litigation and violations that could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and reputation 

certain of our operations are subject to environmental laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which they operate which impose limitations on the discharge of pollutants into the ground air and water and establish standards for the generation treatment use storage and disposal of hazardous wastes we must also comply with various health and safety regulations in the united states and abroad in connection with our operations failure to comply with any of these laws could result in civil and criminal monetary and nonmonetary penalties and damage to our reputation in addition we may incur costs related to remedial efforts or alleged environmental damage associated with past or current waste disposal practices legislation has been proposed and governmental regulatory action has been both proposed and taken that may significantly impact environmental compliance in the united states these actions could increase our costs of production by raising the cost of energy as well as by further restricting emissions or other processes that we currently use in our operations we cannot provide assurance that our costs of complying with current or future environmental protection and health and safety laws will not exceed our estimates 

the inability to successfully defend claims from taxing authorities could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we conduct business in many countries which requires us to interpret the income tax laws and rulings in each of those taxing jurisdictions due to the subjectivity of tax laws between those jurisdictions as well as the subjectivity of factual interpretations our estimates of income tax liabilities may differ from actual payments or assessments claims from taxing authorities related to these differences could have an adverse impact on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

failure to attract and retain qualified personnel could lead to a loss of revenue andor profitability 

snapon’s success depends in part on the efforts and abilities of its senior management team and other key employees their skills experience and industry contacts significantly benefit our operations and administration the failure to attract and retain members of our senior management team and other key employees could have a negative effect on our operating results in addition transitions of important responsibilities to new individuals inherently include the possibility of disruptions to our business and operations which could negatively affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

the steps taken to restructure operations rationalize operating footprint lower operating expenses and achieve greater efficiencies in the supply chain could disrupt business 

we have taken steps in the past and expect to take additional steps in the future intended to improve customer service and drive further efficiencies and reduce costs some of which could be disruptive to our business these actions collectively across our operating groups are focused on the following 

 

         

 

 

  

 

  

a failure to succeed in the implementation of any or all of these actions could result in an inability to achieve our financial goals and could be disruptive to the business 

in addition any future reductions to headcount and other cost reduction measures may result in the loss of technical expertise and could adversely affect our research and development efforts as well as our ability to meet product development schedules efforts to reduce components of expense could result in the recording of charges for inventory and technologyrelated writeoffs workforce reduction costs or other charges relating to the consolidation or closure of facilities if we were to incur a substantial charge to further these efforts our earnings per share would be adversely affected in such period if we are unable to effectively manage our cost reduction and restructuring efforts our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows could be negatively affected

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

management overview 

references in this management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations to “organic sales” refer to sales from continuing operations calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america “gaap” excluding acquisitionrelated sales and the impact of foreign currency translation management evaluates the company’s sales performance based on organic sales growth which primarily reflects growth from the company’s existing businesses as a result of increased output customer base and geographic expansion new product development andor pricing and excludes sales contributions from acquired operations the company did not own as of the comparable prioryear reporting period the company’s organic sales disclosures also exclude the effects of foreign currency translation as foreign currency translation is subject to volatility that can obscure underlying business trends management believes that the nongaap financial measure of organic sales is meaningful to investors as it provides them with useful information to aid in identifying underlying growth trends in our businesses and facilitating comparisons of our sales performance with prior periods 

we believe our growth in 2016 demonstrates snapon’s continued progress in providing repeatability and reliability to a wide range of professional customers performing critical tasks in workplaces of consequence as continued strengthening in the automotive repair sector combined with headwinds in certain industrial end markets that were most pronounced in the first half of the year leveraging capabilities already demonstrated in the automotive repair arena our “coherent growth” strategy focuses on developing and expanding our professional customer base not only in automotive repair but in adjacent markets additional geographies and other areas including in critical industries where the cost and penalties for failure can be high 

we believe our 2016 operating results also provide continued evidence that snapon’s value proposition of making work easier for serious professionals in workplaces of consequence is an ongoing strength as we move forward along our runways for coherent growth 

 

    we also believe our yearoveryear improvement in operating margin further validates the potential of our snapon value creation processes – our suite of strategic principles and processes we employ every day designed to create value and employed in the areas of safety quality customer connection innovation and rapid continuous improvement 

our global financial services operations continue to serve a significant strategic role in offering financing options to our franchisees to their customers and to customers in other parts of our business we expect that our global financial services business which includes both snapon credit llc “soc” in the united states and our other international finance subsidiaries will continue to be a meaningful contributor to our operating earnings going forward 

snapon has significant international operations and is subject to risks inherent with foreign operations including foreign currency translation fluctuations

snapon evaluates the recoverability of goodwill by estimating the future discounted cash flows of the businesses to which the goodwill relates estimated cash flows and related goodwill are grouped at the reporting unit level the company has determined that its reporting units for testing goodwill impairment are its operating segments or components of an operating segment that constitute a business for which discrete financial information is available and for which segment management regularly reviews the operating results within its four reportable operating segments the company has identified 11 reporting units 

snapon evaluates the recoverability of goodwill by utilizing an income approach that estimates the fair value of the future discounted cash flows of the reporting units to which the goodwill relates the future projections which are based on both past performance and the projections and assumptions used in the company’s operating plans are subject to change as a result of changing economic and competitive conditions this approach reflects management’s internal outlook at the reporting units which management believes provides the best determination of value due to management’s insight and experience with the reporting units significant estimates used by management in the discounted cash flows methodology include estimates of future cash flows based on expected growth rates price increases working capital levels expected benefits from rci initiatives and a weightedaverage cost of capital that reflects the specific risk profile of the reporting unit being tested the company’s methodologies for valuing goodwill are applied consistently on a yearoveryear basis the assumptions used in performing the second quarter 2016 impairment calculations were evaluated in light of thencurrent market and business conditions snapon continues to believe that the future discounted cash flow valuation model provides the most reasonable and meaningful fair value estimate based upon the reporting units’ projections of future operating results and cash flows and replicates how market participants would value the company’s reporting units in an orderly transaction 

  

 

 

  

 

  

in the event the fair value of a reporting unit is less than the carrying value including goodwill the company would then perform an additional assessment that would compare the implied fair value of goodwill with the carrying amount of goodwill the determination of implied fair value of goodwill would require management to compare the estimated fair value of the reporting unit to the estimated fair value of the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit if necessary the company may consult with valuation specialists to assist with the assessment of the estimated fair value of the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit if the implied fair value of the goodwill is less than the carrying value an impairment loss would be recorded 

snapon also evaluates the recoverability of its indefinitelived trademarks by utilizing an income approach that estimates the fair value of the future discounted cash flows of each of its trademarks the future projections which are based on both past performance and the projections and assumptions used in the company’s operating plans are subject to change as a result of changing economic and competitive conditions significant estimates used by management in the discounted cash flows methodology include estimates of future cash flows based on expected growth and royalty rates expected synergies and a weightedaverage cost of capital that reflects the specific risk profile of the trademark being tested the company’s methodologies for valuing trademarks are applied consistently on a yearoveryear basis the assumptions used in performing the second quarter 2016 impairment calculations were evaluated in light of thencurrent market and business conditions snapon continues to believe that the future discounted cash flow valuation model provides the most reasonable and meaningful fair value estimate based upon the trademarks’ projected future cash flows and replicates how market participants would value the company’s trademarks in an orderly transaction 

inherent in fair value determinations are significant judgments and estimates including material assumptions about future revenue profitability and cash flows the company’s operational plans and its interpretation of current economic indicators should the operations of the businesses with which goodwill or other indefinitelived intangible assets are associated incur significant declines in profitability and cash flow due to significant and longterm deterioration in macroeconomic industry and market conditions the loss of key customers changes in technology or markets significant changes in key personnel or litigation a significant and sustained decrease in share price andor other events including effects from the sale or disposal of a reporting unit some or all of the recorded goodwill or other indefinitelived intangible assets could be subject to impairment and could result in a material adverse effect on snapon’s financial position or results of operations 

snapon completed its annual impairment testing of goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets in the second quarter of 2016 the results of which did not result in any impairment as of 2016 year end the company has no accumulated impairment losses although the company consistently uses the same methods in developing the assumptions and estimates underlying the fair value calculations such estimates are uncertain by nature and can vary from actual results in performing its annual impairment testing the company performed a sensitivity analysis on the material assumptions used in the discounted cash flow valuation models for each of its 11 reporting units based on the company’s second quarter 2016 impairment testing and assuming a hypothetical 10 decrease in the estimated fair values of each of its 11 reporting units the hypothetical fair value of each of the company’s 11 reporting units would have been greater than its carrying value see note 6 to the consolidated financial statements for further information about goodwill and other intangible assets 

pension benefits the pension benefit obligation and related pension expense are calculated in accordance with gaap and are impacted by certain actuarial assumptions changes in these assumptions are primarily influenced by factors outside of snapon’s control such as changes in economic conditions and can have a significant effect on the amounts reported in the financial statements snapon believes that the two most critical assumptions are i the expected return on plan assets and ii the assumed discount rate 

snapon’s domestic pension plans have a longterm investment horizon and a total return strategy that emphasizes a capital growth objective in 2016 the longterm investment performance objective for snapon’s domestic plans’ assets was to achieve net of expense returns that met or exceeded the 76 domestic expected return on plan assets assumption snapon uses a threeyear marketrelated value asset method of amortizing the difference between actual and expected returns on its domestic plans’ assets as of 2016 year end snapon’s domestic pension plans’ assets comprised approximately 86 of the company’s worldwide pension plan assets 

  

 

 

 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued 

 

 

 

  

based on forwardlooking capital market expectations snapon selected an expected return on plan assets assumption for its us pension plans of 75 a decrease of 10 bps from 2016 to be used in determining pension expense for 2017 in estimating the domestic expected return on plan assets snapon utilizes a nominal returns forecasting method for each asset class future returns are estimated by identifying the premium of riskier asset classes over lower risk alternatives the methodology constructs expected returns using a “building block” approach to the individual components of total return these forecasts are stated in both nominal and real after inflation terms this process first considers the longterm historical return premium based on the longest set of data available for each asset class these premiums calculated using the geometric mean are then adjusted based on current relative valuation levels macroeconomic conditions and the expected alpha related to active investment management the asset return assumption is also adjusted by an implicit expense load for estimated administrative and investmentrelated expenses since asset allocation is a key determinant of expected investment returns the current and expected mix of plan assets are also considered when setting the assumption 

pension expense increases as the expected rate of return on plan assets decreases lowering the expected rate of return assumption for snapon’s domestic pension plans’ assets by 50 bps would have increased snapon’s 2016 domestic pension expense by approximately 47 million 

the objective of snapon’s discount rate assumption is to reflect the rate at which the pension benefits could be effectively settled in making this determination the company takes into account the timing and amount of benefits that would be available under the plans the domestic discount rate as of 2016 and 2015 year end was selected based on a cash flow matching methodology developed by the company’s outside actuaries and which incorporates a review of current economic conditions this methodology matches the plans’ yearly projected cash flows for benefits and service costs to those of hypothetical bond portfolios using highquality aa rated or better corporate bonds from either moody’s investors service or standard  poor’s credit rating agencies available at the measurement date this technique calculates bond portfolios that produce adequate cash flows to pay the plans’ projected yearly benefits and then selects the portfolio with the highest yield and uses that yield as the recommended discount rate 

the selection of the 45 weightedaverage discount rate for snapon’s domestic pension plans as of 2016 year end compared to 47 as of 2015 year end represents the single rate that produces the same present value of cash flows as the estimated benefit plan payments lowering snapon’s domestic discount rate assumption by 50 bps would have increased snapon’s 2016 domestic pension expense and projected benefit obligation by approximately 67 million and 653 million respectively as of 2016 year end snapon’s domestic projected benefit obligation comprised approximately 83 of snapon’s worldwide projected benefit obligation the weightedaverage discount rate for snapon’s foreign pension plans of 29 compared to 37 as of 2015 year end represents the single rate that produces the same present value of cash flows as the estimated benefit plan payments lowering snapon’s foreign discount rate assumption by 50 bps would have increased snapon’s 2016 foreign pension expense and projected benefit obligation by approximately 17 million and 234 million respectively 

actuarial gains and losses in excess of 10 percent of the greater of the projected benefit obligation or marketrelated value of assets are amortized on a straightline basis over the average remaining service period of active participants or over the average remaining life expectancy for plans with primarily inactive participants prior service costs and credits resulting from plan amendments are amortized in equal annual amounts over the average remaining service period of active participants or over the average remaining life expectancy for plans with primarily inactive participants 

to determine the 2017 net periodic benefit cost snapon is using weightedaverage discount rates for its domestic and foreign pension plans of 45 and 29 respectively and an expected return on plan assets for its domestic pension plans of 75 the expected returns on plan assets for foreign pension plans ranged from 18 and 63 as of 2016 year end the net change in these two key assumptions from those used in 2016 is expected to increase pension expense in 2017 other factors such as changes in plan demographics and discretionary contributions may further increase or decrease pension expense in 2017 see note 11 to the consolidated financial statements for further information on pension plans 

  

 

 

  

 

  

allowances for doubtful accounts on finance and contract receivables the allowances for doubtful accounts on finance and contract receivables are maintained at levels management believes are adequate to cover probable losses inherent in snapon’s finance and contract receivables portfolios as of the measurement date the allowances represent management’s estimate of the losses inherent in the company’s receivables portfolios based on ongoing assessments and evaluations of collectability and historical loss experience determination of the proper level of allowances by portfolio requires management to exercise significant judgment about the timing frequency and severity of losses that could materially affect the provision for doubtful accounts and as a result net earnings the allowances take into consideration numerous quantitative and qualitative factors that include receivable type historical loss experience loss migration delinquency trends collection experience current economic conditions and credit risk characteristics some of these factors are influenced by items such as the customers’ financial condition debtservicing ability past payment experience and credit bureau and proprietary snapon credit model information as well as the value of the underlying collateral changes in economic conditions and assumptions including the resulting credit quality metrics relative to the performance of the finance and contract receivables portfolios create uncertainty and could result in changes to both the allowances and provisions for doubtful accounts 

management utilizes established policies and procedures in an effort to ensure the estimates and assumptions are well controlled reviewed and consistently applied as of december 31 2016 the ratios of the allowances for doubtful accounts to finance and contract receivables the “allowance ratios” were 334 and 103 respectively as of january 2 2016 the respective allowance ratios were 304 and 125 while management believes it exercises prudent judgment and applies reasonable assumptions in establishing its estimates for allowances for finance and contract receivables there can be no assurance that changes in economic conditions or other factors would not adversely impact the financial health of our customers and result in changes to the estimates used in the allowance calculations for reference a 100 bps increase in the allowance ratios for both finance and contract receivables as of december 31 2016 would have increased snapon’s 2016 provision expense and related allowances for doubtful accounts by approximately 146 million and 38 million respectively 

for additional information on snapon’s allowances for doubtful accounts see note 1 and note 3 to the consolidated financial statements 

outlook 

snapon expects to make continued progress in 2017 along its defined runways for coherent growth leveraging capabilities already demonstrated in the automotive repair arena and developing and expanding its professional customer base not only in automotive repair but in adjacent markets additional geographies and other areas including extending in critical industries where the cost and penalties for failure can be high in pursuit of these initiatives snapon expects that capital expenditures in 2017 will be in a range of 80 million to 90 million snapon also anticipates that its full year 2017 effective income tax rate will be comparable to its 2016 full year rate 

  

 

 

  

 

  




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

market credit and economic risks 

market risk is the potential economic loss that may result from adverse changes in the fair value of financial instruments snapon is exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates including as a result of the recent weakening of the british pound visàvis the us dollar following the united kingdom’s referendum vote to exit from the european union snapon is also exposed to market risk associated with the stockbased portion of its deferred compensation plans snapon monitors its exposure to these risks and attempts to manage the underlying economic exposures through the use of financial instruments such as foreign currency forward contracts interest rate swap agreements treasury lock agreements and prepaid equity forward agreements “equity forwards” snapon does not use derivative instruments for speculative or trading purposes snapon’s broadbased business activities help to reduce the impact that volatility in any particular area or related areas may have on its operating earnings as a whole snapon’s management takes an active role in the risk management process and has developed policies and procedures that require specific administrative and business functions to assist in the identification assessment and control of various risks 

foreign currency risk management 

snapon has significant international operations and is subject to certain risks inherent with foreign operations that include currency fluctuations foreign currency exchange risk exists to the extent that snapon has payment obligations or receipts denominated in currencies other than the functional currency including intercompany loans denominated in foreign currencies to manage these exposures snapon identifies naturally offsetting positions and then purchases hedging instruments to protect the residual net exposures see note 10 to the consolidated financial statements for information on foreign currency risk management 

interest rate risk management 

snapon aims to control funding costs by managing the exposure created by the differing maturities and interest rate structures of snapon’s borrowings through the use of interest rate swap agreements treasury lock agreements are used from time to time to manage the potential change in interest rates in anticipation of the possible issuance of fixed rate debt see note 10 to the consolidated financial statements for information on interest rate risk management 

snapon utilizes a valueatrisk “var” model to determine the potential oneday loss in the fair value of its interest rate and foreign exchangesensitive financial instruments from adverse changes in market factors the var model estimates were made assuming normal market conditions and a 95 confidence level snapon’s computations are based on the interrelationships among movements in various currencies and interest rates variancecovariance technique these interrelationships were determined by observing interest rate and foreign currency market changes over the preceding quarter 

the estimated maximum potential oneday loss in fair value calculated using the var model as of 2016 and 2015 year end was 04 million and 06 million respectively on interest ratesensitive financial instruments and 08 million and 05 million respectively on foreign currencysensitive financial instruments the var model is a risk management tool and does not purport to represent actual losses in fair value that will be incurred by snapon nor does it consider the potential effect of favorable changes in market factors 

stockbased deferred compensation risk management 

snapon aims to manage market risk associated with the stockbased portion of its deferred compensation plans through the use of equity forwards equity forwards are used to aid in offsetting the potential marktomarket effect on stockbased deferred compensation from changes in snapon’s stock price since stockbased deferred compensation liabilities increase as the company’s stock price rises and decrease as the company’s stock price declines the equity forwards are intended to mitigate the potential impact on deferred compensation expense that may result from such marktomarket changes see note 10 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on stockbased deferred compensation risk management 

  

 

 

  

 

  

credit risk 

credit risk is the possibility of loss from a customer’s failure to make payments according to contract terms prior to extending credit each customer is evaluated taking into consideration various factors including the customer’s financial condition debtservicing ability past payment experience credit bureau information and other financial and qualitative factors that may affect the customer’s ability to repay as well as the value of the underlying collateral credit risk is also monitored regularly through the use of internal proprietary custom scoring models to evaluate each transaction at the time of the application for credit and by periodically updating those credit scores for ongoing monitoring purposes snapon evaluates credit quality through the use of an internal proprietary measuring system that provides a framework to analyze finance and contract receivables on the basis of risk factors of the individual obligor as well as transaction specific risk the finance and contract receivables are typically monitored through an asset quality review process that closely monitors past due accounts and initiates a progressive collection action process when appropriate 

counterparty risk 

snapon is exposed to credit losses in the event of nonperformance by the counterparties to its various financial agreements including its foreign currency forward contracts interest rate swap agreements treasury lock agreements and prepaid equity forward agreements snapon does not obtain collateral or other security to support financial instruments subject to credit risk but monitors the credit standing of the counterparties and generally enters into agreements with financial institution counterparties with a credit rating of a or better snapon does not anticipate nonperformance by its counterparties but cannot provide assurances 

economic risk 

economic risk is the possibility of loss resulting from economic instability in certain areas of the world snapon continually monitors its exposure in these markets for example the company will be monitoring the potential effects of the united kingdom’s referendum vote to exit from the european union although it is too soon to know what effects the results of the referendum will have on the world economy or the company inflation has not had a significant impact on the company 

as a result of the above market credit and economic risks net earnings and revenues in any particular period may not be representative of fullyear results and may vary significantly from year to year 

commodity risk 

snapon is a purchaser of certain commodities such as steel natural gas and electricity the company is also a purchaser of components and parts that are integrated into the company’s end products as well as the purchaser of certain finished goods all of which may contain various commodities including steel aluminum nickel copper and others snapon’s supply of raw materials and purchased components are generally and readily available from numerous suppliers 

the principal raw material used in the manufacture of the company’s products is steel which the company purchases in competitive pricesensitive markets to meet snapon’s high quality standards the company’s steel needs range from specialized alloys which are available only from a limited group of approved suppliers to commodity types of alloys these raw materials have historically exhibited price and demand cyclicality some of these materials have been and in the future may be in short supply particularly in the event of mill shutdowns or production cut backs as some steel alloys require specialized manufacturing procedures snapon could experience inventory shortages if it were required to use an alternative manufacturer on short notice additionally unexpected price increases for raw materials could result in higher prices to snapon’s customers or an erosion of the margins on its products 

snapon believes its ability to sell product is also dependent on the number of vehicles on the road the number of miles driven and the general aging of vehicles these factors affect the frequency type and amount of service and repair performed on vehicles by technicians and therefore affect the demand for the number of technicians the prosperity of the technicians and consequently the demand technicians have for the company’s tools other products and services and the value technicians place on those products and services the use of other methods of transportation including more frequent use of public transportation could result in a decrease in the use of privately operated vehicles a decrease in the use of privately operated vehicles may lead to fewer repairs and less demand for the company’s products 

to the extent that commodity prices increase and the company does not have firm pricing agreements with its suppliers the company may experience margin declines to the extent that it is not able to increase the selling prices of its products

changes in internal control 

there has not been any change in the company’s internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended december 31 2016 that has materially affected or is reasonably likely to materially affect the company’s internal control over financial reporting as such term is defined in exchange act rules 13a15f and 15d15f 

management’s report on internal control over financial reporting

financial services 

snapon also generates revenue from various financing programs that include i installment sales and lease contracts arising from franchisees’ customers and snapon’s industrial and other customers for the purchase or lease of tools including tool storage and diagnostic and equipment products on an extendedterm payment plan and ii business loans and vehicle leases to franchisees the decision to finance through snapon or another financing entity is solely at the customer’s election when assessing customers for potential financing snapon considers various factors including financial condition collateral debtservicing ability past payment experience credit bureau information and proprietary credit models 

snapon offers financing through soc and the company’s international finance subsidiaries in those markets where snapon has franchise operations financing revenue from contract originations is recognized over the life of the contracts with interest computed primarily on the average daily balances of the underlying contracts 

sales and distribution 

snapon markets and distributes its products and related services principally to professional tool and equipment users around the world the two largest market sectors are the vehicle service and repair sector and the industrial sector 

vehicle service and repair sector 

the vehicle service and repair sector has three main customer groups i professional technicians who purchase tools and diagnostic and equipment products for themselves ii other professional customers related to vehicle repair including owners and managers of independent repair shops and oem dealerships who purchase tools and diagnostic and equipment products for use by multiple technicians within a service or repair facility and iii oems 

snapon provides innovative tool equipment and business solutions as well as technical sales support and training designed to meet technicians’ evolving needs snapon’s mobile tool distribution system offers technicians the convenience of purchasing quality tools at their place of business with minimal disruption of their work routine snapon also provides owners and managers of repair shops where technicians work with tools diagnostic equipment and repair and service information including electronic parts catalogs and shop management products snapon’s oem facilitation business provides oems with products and services including tools consulting and facilitation services which include product procurement distribution and administrative support to customers for their dealership equipment programs 

the vehicle service and repair sector is characterized by an increasing rate of technological change within motor vehicles vehicle population growth and increasing vehicle life and the resulting effects of these changes on the businesses of both our suppliers and customers snapon believes it is a meaningful participant in the vehicle service and repair market sector 

industrial sector 

snapon markets its products and services globally to a broad crosssection of commercial and industrial customers including maintenance and repair operations manufacturing and assembly facilities various government agencies facilities and operations including military operations vocational and technical schools aviation and aerospace operations oem and service and repair customers oil and gas developers mining operations energy and power generation equipment fabricators and operators railroad manufacturing and maintenance customers in agriculture infrastructure construction companies and other customers that require instrumentation service tools andor equipment for their product and business needs 

the industrial sector for snapon focuses on providing valueadded products and services to an increasingly expanding global base of customers in critical industries through its experienced and dispersed sales organization industrial “solutioneers” develop unique and highly valued productivity solutions for customers worldwide that leverage snapon’s product service and development capabilities 

the industrial sector is characterized by a highly competitive costconscious environment and a trend toward customers making many of their tool and equipment purchases through one integrated supplier snapon believes it is a meaningful participant in the industrial tools and equipment market sector 

  

 

 

  

 

  

distribution channels 

snapon serves customers primarily through the following channels of distribution i the mobile van channel ii company direct sales iii distributors and iv ecommerce the following discussion summarizes snapon’s general approach for each channel and is not intended to be allinclusive 

mobile van channel 

in the united states a significant portion of sales to the vehicle service and repair sector is conducted through snapon’s mobile franchise van channel snapon’s franchisees primarily serve vehicle repair technicians and vehicle service shop owners generally providing weekly contact at the customer’s place of business franchisees’ sales are concentrated in hand and power tools tool storage products shop equipment and diagnostic and repair information products which can easily be transported in a van or trailer and demonstrated during a brief sales call franchisees purchase snapon’s products at a discount from suggested list prices and resell them at prices established by the franchisee us franchisees are provided a list of calls that serves as the basis of the franchisee’s sales route snapon’s franchisees also have the opportunity to add a limited number of additional franchises 

snapon charges nominal initial and ongoing monthly franchise fees franchise fee revenue including nominal nonrefundable initial and ongoing monthly fees primarily for sales and business training and marketing and product promotion programs is recognized as the fees are earned franchise fee revenue totaled 127 million 121 million and 119 million in fiscal 2015 2014 and 2013 respectively 

snapon also has a companyowned route program that is designed to i provide another pool of potential field organization personnel ii service customers in select new andor open routes not currently serviced by franchisees and iii allow snapon to pilot new sales and promotional ideas prior to introducing them to franchisees as of 2015 year end companyowned routes comprised approximately 3 of the total route population snapon may elect to increase or reduce the number of companyowned routes in the future 

in addition to its mobile van channel in the united states snapon has replicated its us franchise distribution model in certain other countries including the united kingdom canada japan australia germany the netherlands south africa new zealand belgium and ireland in many of these markets as in the united states purchase decisions are generally made or influenced by professional vehicle service technicians as well as repair shop owners and managers as of 2015 year end snapon’s worldwide route count was approximately 4800 including approximately 3500 routes in the united states 

through soc financing is available to us franchisees including financing for van leases working capital loans and loans to help enable new franchisees to fund the purchase of the franchise in many international markets snapon offers a variety of financing options to its franchisees andor customer networks through its international finance subsidiaries the decision to finance through snapon or another financing entity is solely at the customer’s election 

snapon supports its franchisees with a field organization of regional offices franchise performance teams customer care centers and distribution centers snapon also provides sales and business training and marketing and product promotion programs as well as customer and franchisee financing programs through soc and the company’s international finance subsidiaries all of which are designed to strengthen franchisee sales national franchise advisory councils in the united states the united kingdom canada and australia composed primarily of franchisees that are elected by franchisees assist snapon in identifying and implementing enhancements to the franchise program 

company direct sales 

a significant proportion of shop equipment sales in north america under the john bean hofmann blackhawk challenger and procut brands diagnostic products under the snapon brand and information products under the mitchell1 brand are made by direct and independent sales forces that have responsibility for national and other accounts as the vehicle service and repair sector consolidates with more business conducted by national chains and franchised service centers snapon believes these larger organizations can be serviced most effectively by sales people who can demonstrate and sell the full line of diagnostic and equipment products and services snapon also sells these products and services directly to oems and their franchised dealers 

  

 

 

  

 

  

snapon brand tools and equipment are marketed to industrial and governmental customers in the united states through both industrial sales representatives who are employees and independent industrial distributors outside of the united states industrial sales are also conducted through other independent distributors sales representatives focus on industrial customers whose main purchase criteria are quality and integrated solutions as of 2015 year end snapon had industrial sales representatives in the united states australia canada japan mexico puerto rico and various european asian latin american middle eastern and african countries with the united states representing the majority of snapon’s total industrial sales 

snapon also sells software services and solutions to the automotive commercial heavy duty agriculture power equipment and power sports segments products and services are marketed to targeted groups including oems and their dealerships fleets and individual repair shops to effectively reach oems which frequently have a multinational presence snapon has deployed focused business teams globally 

distributors 

sales of certain tools and equipment are made through independent distributors who purchase the items from snapon and resell them to end users hand tools sold under the bahco fish and hook irimo lindström and williams brands and trade names for example are sold through distributors in europe north and south america asia and certain other parts of the world wheel service and other vehicle service equipment are sold through distributors primarily under brands including hofmann john bean challenger procut cartec blackhawk and ecotechnics diagnostic and equipment products are marketed through distributors in south america and asia and through both a direct sales force and distributors in europe under the snapon sun bahco and bluepoint brands 

ecommerce 

snapon offers current and prospective customers online access to research and purchase products through its public website at wwwsnaponcom  the site features an online catalog of snapon hand tools power tools tool storage units and diagnostic equipment available to customers in the united states the united kingdom canada and australia ecommerce and certain other system enhancement initiatives are designed to improve productivity and further leverage the oneonone relationships and service snapon has with its current and prospective customers sales through the company’s ecommerce distribution channel were not significant in any of the last three years 

competition 

snapon competes on the basis of its product quality and performance product line breadth and depth service brand awareness and imagery technological innovation and availability of financing through soc or its international finance subsidiaries while snapon does not believe that any single company competes with it across all of its product lines and distribution channels various companies compete in one or more product categories andor distribution channels 

snapon believes it is a leading manufacturer and distributor of professional tools tool storage diagnostic and equipment products and repair software and solutions offering a broad line of these products to both vehicle service and industrial marketplaces various competitors target and sell to professional technicians in the vehicle service and repair sector through the mobile tool distribution channel snapon also competes with companies that sell tools and equipment to vehicle service and repair technicians online and through retail stores vehicle parts supply outlets and tool supply warehousesdistributorships within the power tools category and the industrial sector snapon has various other competitors including companies with offerings that overlap with other areas discussed herein major competitors selling diagnostics shop equipment and information to vehicle dealerships and independent repair shops include oems and their proprietary electronic parts catalogs and diagnostics and information systems and other companies that offer products serving this sector 

raw materials and purchased product 

snapon’s supply of raw materials and purchased components are generally and readily available from numerous suppliers snapon believes it has secured an ample supply of both bar and coil steel for the near future to ensure stable supply to meet material demands the company does not currently anticipate experiencing any significant impact in 2016 from steel pricing or availability issues 

  

 

 

  

 

  

patents trademarks and other intellectual property 

snapon vigorously pursues and relies on patent protection to protect its intellectual property and position in its markets as of 2015 year end snapon and its subsidiaries held approximately 700 active and pending patents in the united states and approximately 1550 active and pending patents outside of the united states sales relating to any single patent did not represent a material portion of snapon’s revenues in any of the last three years 

examples of products that have features or designs that benefit from patent protection include wheel alignment systems wheel balancers tire changers vehicle lifts tool storage tool control test lanes brake lathes sealed ratchets electronic torque instruments ratcheting screwdrivers emissionssensing devices and diagnostic equipment 

much of the technology used in the manufacture of vehicle service tools and equipment is in the public domain snapon relies primarily on trade secret protection to protect proprietary processes used in manufacturing methods and processes are patented when appropriate copyright protection is also utilized when appropriate 

trademarks used by snapon are of continuing importance to snapon in the marketplace trademarks have been registered in the united states and more than 120 other countries and additional applications for trademark registrations are pending snapon vigorously polices proper use of its trademarks snapon’s right to manufacture and sell certain products is dependent upon licenses from others however these products under license do not represent a material portion of snapon’s net sales 

domain names have become a valuable corporate asset for companies around the world including snapon domain names often contain a trademark or service mark or even a corporate name and are often considered intellectual property the recognition and value of the snapon name trademark and domain name are core strengths of the company 

snapon strategically licenses the snapon brand to carefully selected manufacturing and distribution companies for items such as apparel work boots lighting and a variety of other goods in order to further build equity and market presence for the company’s strongest brand 

environmental 

snapon is subject to various environmental laws ordinances regulations and other requirements of government authorities in the united states and other nations at snapon these environmental liabilities are managed through the snapon environmental health and safety management system “eh  sms” which is applied worldwide the system is based upon continual improvement and is certified to iso 140012004 and ohsas 180012007 verified through det norske veritas dnv certification inc 

snapon believes that it complies with applicable environmental control requirements in its operations expenditures on environmental matters through eh  sms have not had and snapon does not for the foreseeable future expect them to have a material effect upon snapon’s capital expenditures earnings or competitive position 

employees 

snapon employed approximately 11500 people at the end of january 2016 snapon employed approximately 11400 people at the end of january 2015 

approximately 2600 employees or 23 of snapon’s worldwide workforce are represented by unions andor covered under collective bargaining agreements the number of covered union employees whose contracts expire over the next five years approximates 1400 employees in 2016 700 employees in 2017 and 500 employees in 2018 there are no contracts currently scheduled to expire in 2019 or 2020 in recent years snapon has not experienced any significant work slowdowns stoppages or other labor disruptions 

there can be no assurance that these and other future contracts with snapon’s unions will be renegotiated upon terms acceptable to snapon 

  

 

 

  

 

  

working capital 

most of snapon’s businesses are not seasonal and their inventory needs are relatively constant snapon did not have a significant backlog of orders at 2015 year end in recent years snapon has been using its working capital to fund in part the continued growth of the company’s financial services portfolio 

snapon’s liquidity and capital resources and use of working capital are discussed herein in “part ii item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” 

as of 2015 year end neither snapon nor any of its segments depend on any single customer small group of customers or government for any material part of its revenues 




 item 1a risk factors 

in evaluating the company careful consideration should be given to the following risk factors in addition to the other information included in this annual report on form 10k including the consolidated financial statements and the related notes each of these risk factors could adversely affect the company’s business operating results cash flows andor financial condition as well as adversely affect the value of an investment in the company’s common stock 

economic conditions and world events could affect our operating results 

we our franchisees and our customers may be adversely affected by changing economic conditions including conditions that may particularly impact specific regions these conditions may result in reduced consumer and investor confidence instability in the credit and financial markets volatile corporate profits and reduced business and consumer spending we our franchisees and our customers and the economy as a whole also may be affected by future world or local events outside our control such as acts of terrorism developments in the war on terrorism conflicts in international situations and natural disasters as well as governmentrelated developments or issues these factors may affect our results of operations by reducing our sales margins andor net earnings as a result of a slowdown in customer orders or order cancellations impact the availability of raw materials andor the supply chain and could potentially lead to future impairment of our intangible assets in addition political and social turmoil related to international conflicts and terrorist acts may put pressure on economic conditions abroad unstable political social and economic conditions may make it difficult for our franchisees customers suppliers and us to accurately forecast and plan future business activities if such conditions persist our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows could be negatively affected 

raw material and energy price fluctuations and shortages including steel and various fuel sources could adversely affect the ability to obtain needed manufacturing materials and could adversely affect our results of operations 

the principal raw material used in the manufacture of our products is steel which we purchase in competitive pricesensitive markets to meet snapon’s high quality standards our steel needs range from specialized alloys which are available only from a limited group of approved suppliers to commodity types of alloys these raw materials have historically exhibited price and demand cyclicality some of these materials have been and in the future may be in short supply particularly in the event of mill shutdowns or production cut backs as some steel alloys require specialized manufacturing procedures we could experience inventory shortages if we were required to use an alternative manufacturer on short notice additionally unexpected price increases for raw materials could result in higher prices to our customers or an erosion of the margins on our products 

we believe our ability to sell our products is also dependent on the number of vehicles on the road the number of miles driven and the general aging of vehicles these factors affect the frequency type and amount of service and repair performed on vehicles by technicians and therefore affect the demand for the number of technicians the prosperity of technicians and consequently the demand technicians have for our tools other products and services and the value technicians place on those products and services the use of other methods of transportation including more frequent use of public transportation could result in a decrease in the use of privately operated vehicles a decrease in the use of privately operated vehicles may lead to fewer repairs and less demand for our products 

  

 

 

  

 

  

we use various energy sources to transport produce and distribute products and some of our products have components that are petroleum based petroleum and energy prices have periodically increased significantly over short periods of time further volatility and changes may be caused by market fluctuations supply and demand currency fluctuation production and transportation disruption world events and changes in governmental programs energy price increases raise both our operating costs and the costs of our materials and we may not be able to increase our prices enough to offset these costs higher prices also may reduce the level of future customer orders and our profitability 

the performance of snapon’s mobile tool distribution business depends on the success of its franchisees 

approximately 44 of our consolidated revenues in 2015 were generated by the snapon tools group which consists of snapon’s business operations primarily serving vehicle service and repair technicians through the company’s worldwide mobile tool distribution channel snapon’s success is dependent on its relationships with franchisees individually and collectively as they are the primary sales and service link between the company and vehicle service and repair technicians who are an important class of end users for snapon’s products and services if our franchisees are not successful or if we do not maintain an effective relationship with our franchisees the delivery of products the collection of receivables andor our relationship with end users could be adversely affected and thereby negatively impact our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

in addition if we are unable to maintain effective relationships with franchisees snapon or the franchisees may choose to terminate the relationship which may result in i open routes in which enduser customers are not provided reliable service ii litigation resulting from termination iii reduced collections or increased writeoffs of franchisee receivables owed to snapon andor iv reduced collections or increased writeoffs of finance and contract receivables 

new and stricter legislation and regulations may affect our business reputation results of operations and financial condition 

increased legislative and regulatory activity and compliance burdens including those associated with sales to our government military and defense contractor customers as well as a more stringent manner in which they are applied could significantly impact our business and the economy as a whole for example the affordable care act the “aca” which continues to be phased in significantly affects the provision of both health care services and benefits in the united states the aca may impact our cost of providing our employees and retirees with health insurance andor benefits and may also impact various other aspects of our business the aca did not have a material impact on our fiscal 2015 2014 or 2013 financial results however we are continuing to assess the impact of the aca on our health care benefit costs 

financial services businesses of all kinds are subject to increasing regulation and enforcement in addition to potentially increasing the costs of doing business due to compliance obligations new laws and regulations or changes to existing laws and regulations as well as the enforcement thereof may affect the relationships between creditors and debtors inhibit the rights of creditors to collect amounts owed to them expand liability for certain actions or inactions or limit the types of financial products or services offered any or all of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows failure to comply with any of these laws or regulations could also result in penalties and damage to our reputation andor the incurrence of remediation costs 

these developments and other potential future legislation and regulations as well as the increasingly strict regulatory environment including the growing international regulation of privacy rights may also adversely affect the customers to which and the markets into which we sell our products and increase our costs and otherwise negatively affect our business reputation results of operations and financial condition including in ways that cannot yet be foreseen 

exposure to credit risks of customers and resellers may make it difficult to collect receivables and could adversely affect operating results and financial condition 

a decline in industry andor economic conditions could have the potential to weaken the financial position of some of our customers if circumstances surrounding our customers’ ability to repay their credit obligations were to deteriorate and result in the writedown or writeoff of such receivables it would negatively affect our operating results for the period in which they occur and if large could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

  

 

 

  

 

  

our inability to provide acceptable financing alternatives to enduser customers and franchisees could adversely impact our operating results 

an integral component of our business and profitability is our ability to offer competitive financing alternatives to enduser customers and franchisees the lack of our ability to offer such alternatives or obtain capital resources or other financing to support our receivables on terms that we believe are attractive whether resulting from the state of the financial markets our own operating performance or other factors would negatively affect our operating results and financial condition adverse fluctuations in interest rates andor our ability to provide competitive financing programs could also have an adverse impact on our revenue and profitability 

failure to achieve expected investment returns on pension plan assets as well as changes in interest rates or plan demographics could adversely impact our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

snapon sponsors various defined benefit pension plans the “pension plans” the assets of the pension plans are broadly diversified in an attempt to mitigate the risk of a large loss the assets are invested in equity securities debt securities hedge funds real estate and other real assets insurance contracts and cash and cash equivalents required funding for the company’s domestic defined benefit pension plans is determined in accordance with guidelines set forth in the federal employee retirement income security act “erisa” foreign defined benefit pension plans are funded in accordance with local statutes or practice additional contributions to enhance the funded status of the pension plans can be made at the company’s discretion however there can be no assurance that the value of the pension plan assets or the investment returns on those plan assets will be sufficient to meet the future benefit obligations of such plans in addition during periods of adverse investment market conditions and declining interest rates the company may be required to make additional cash contributions to the pension plans that could reduce our financial flexibility changes in plan demographics including an increase in the number of retirements or changes in life expectancy assumptions may also increase the costs and funding requirements of the obligations related to the company’s pension plans 

our pension plan obligations are affected by changes in market interest rates significant fluctuations in market interest rates have added and may further add volatility to our pension plan obligations in periods of declining market interest rates our pension plan obligations generally increase in periods of increasing market interest rates our pension plan obligations generally decrease while our plan assets are broadly diversified there are inherent market risks associated with investments if adverse market conditions occur our plan assets could incur significant or material losses since we may need to make additional contributions to address changes in obligations andor a loss in plan assets the combination of declining market interest rates past or future plan asset investment losses andor changes in plan demographics could adversely impact our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

the company’s pension plan expense is comprised of the following factors i service cost ii interest on projected benefit obligations iii the expected return on plan assets iv the amortization of prior service costs and credits v the effects of actuarial gains and losses and vi settlementcurtailment costs when applicable the accounting for pensions involves the estimation of a number of factors that are highly uncertain certain factors such as the interest on projected benefit obligations and the expected return on pension plan assets are impacted by changes in market interest rates and the value of plan assets a significant decrease in market interest rates and a decrease in the fair value of pension plan assets would increase net pension expense and may adversely affect the company’s future results of operations see note 11 to the consolidated financial statements for further information on the company’s pension plans 

adverse developments in the credit and financial markets could negatively impact the availability of credit that we and our customers need to operate our businesses 

we depend upon the availability of credit to operate our business including the financing of receivables from enduser customers that are originated by our financial services businesses our enduser customers franchisees and suppliers also require access to credit for their businesses at times in recent years world financial markets have been unstable and subject to uncertainty adverse developments in the credit and financial markets or unfavorable changes in snapon’s credit rating could negatively impact the availability of future financing and the terms on which it might be available to snapon its enduser customers franchisees and suppliers inability to access credit or capital markets or a deterioration in the terms on which financing might be available could have an adverse impact on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

  

 

 

  

 

  

increasing our financial leverage could affect our operations and profitability 

the maximum available credit under our multicurrency revolving credit facility is 700 million the company’s leverage ratio may affect both our availability of additional capital resources as well as our operations in several ways including 

 

     while we believe we will have the ability to service our debt and obtain additional resources in the future if and when needed that will depend upon our results of operations and financial position at the time the thencurrent state of the credit and financial markets and other factors that may be beyond our control therefore we cannot give assurances that credit will be available on terms that we consider attractive or at all if and when necessary or beneficial to us 

data security and information technology infrastructure and security are critical to supporting business objectives failure of our systems to operate effectively could adversely affect our business and reputation 

we depend heavily on information technology infrastructure to achieve our business objectives and to protect sensitive information and continually invest in improving such systems problems that impair or compromise this infrastructure including due to natural disasters power outages major network failures security breaches or malicious attacks or during system upgrades andor new system implementations could impede our ability to record or process orders manufacture and ship in a timely manner account for and collect receivables protect sensitive data of the company our customers our suppliers and business partners or otherwise carry on business in the normal course any such events if significant could cause us to lose customers andor revenue and could require us to incur significant expense to remediate including as a result of legal or regulatory claims or proceedings and could also damage our reputation while we have taken steps to maintain adequate data security and address these risks and uncertainties by implementing security technologies internal controls network and data center resiliency and redundancy and recovery processes as well as by securing insurance these measures may be inadequate 

in association with initiatives to better integrate business units rationalize operating footprint and improve responsiveness to franchisees and customers snapon is continually replacing and enhancing its global enterprise resource planning erp management information systems as we integrate implement and deploy new information technology processes and a common information infrastructure across our global operations we could experience disruptions in our business that could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

failure to maintain effective distribution of products and services could adversely impact revenue gross margin and profitability 

we use a variety of distribution methods to sell our products and services successfully managing the interaction of our distribution efforts to reach various potential customer segments for our products and services is a complex process moreover since each distribution method has distinct risks costs and gross margins our failure to implement the most advantageous balance in the delivery model for our products and services could adversely affect our revenue and gross margins and therefore our profitability 

risks associated with the disruption of manufacturing operations could adversely affect profitability or competitive position 

we manufacture a significant portion of the products we sell any prolonged disruption in the operations of our existing manufacturing facilities whether due to technical or labor difficulties facility consolidation or closure actions lack of raw material or component availability destruction of or damage to any facility as a result of natural disasters use and storage of hazardous materials or other events or other reasons could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

  

 

 

  

 

  

the inability to continue to introduce new products that respond to customer needs and achieve market acceptance could result in lower revenues and reduced profitability 

sales from new products represent a significant portion of our net sales and are expected to continue to represent a significant component of our future net sales we may not be able to compete effectively unless we continue to enhance existing products or introduce new products to the marketplace in a timely manner product improvements and new product introductions require significant financial and other resources including significant planning design development and testing at the technological product and manufacturing process levels our competitors’ new products may beat our products to market be more effective with more features be less expensive than our products andor render our products obsolete any new products that we develop may not receive market acceptance or otherwise generate any meaningful net sales or profits for us relative to our expectations based on among other things existing and anticipated investments in manufacturing capacity and commitments to fund advertising marketing promotional programs and research and development 

the global tool equipment and diagnostics and repair information industries are competitive 

we face strong competition in all of our market segments price competition in our various industries is intense and pricing pressures from competitors and customers are increasing in general as a manufacturer and marketer of premium products and services the expectations of snapon’s customers and its franchisees are high and continue to increase any inability to maintain customer satisfaction could diminish snapon’s premium image and reputation and could result in a lessening of our ability to command premium pricing we expect that the level of competition will remain high in the future which could limit our ability to maintain or increase market share or profitability 

product liability claims and litigation could affect our business reputation financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

the products that we design andor manufacture andor the services we provide can lead to product liability claims or other legal claims being filed against us to the extent that plaintiffs are successful in showing that a defect in a product’s design manufacture or warnings led to personal injury or property damage or that our provision of services resulted in similar injury or damage we may be subject to claims for damages although we are insured for damages above a certain amount we bear the costs and expenses associated with defending claims including frivolous lawsuits and are responsible for damages below the insurance retention amount in addition to claims concerning individual products as a manufacturer we can be subject to costs potential negative publicity and lawsuits related to product recalls which could adversely impact our results and damage our reputation 

legal disputes could adversely affect our business reputation financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

from time to time we are subject to legal disputes that are being litigated andor settled in the ordinary course of business disputes or future lawsuits could result in the diversion of management’s time and attention away from business operations additionally negative developments with respect to legal disputes and the costs incurred in defending ourselves could have an adverse impact on the company and its reputation adverse outcomes or settlements could also require us to pay damages potentially in excess of amounts reserved or incur liability for other remedies that could have a material adverse effect on our business reputation financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

failure to adequately protect intellectual property could adversely affect our business 

intellectual property rights are an important and integral component of our business we attempt to protect our intellectual property rights through a combination of patent trademark copyright and trade secret laws as well as licensing agreements and thirdparty nondisclosure and assignment agreements adverse determinations in a judicial or administrative proceeding could prevent us from manufacturing and selling our products or prevent us from stopping others from manufacturing and selling competing products failure to obtain or maintain adequate protection of our intellectual property rights for any reason could have a material adverse effect on our business 

  

 

 

  

 

  

foreign operations are subject to political economic currency exchange and other risks that could adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

approximately 31 of our revenues in 2015 were generated outside of the united states future growth rates and success of our business depends in large part on continued growth in our nonus operations including growth in emerging markets and critical industries numerous risks and uncertainties affect our nonus operations these risks and uncertainties include political economic and social instability such as acts of war civil disturbance or acts of terrorism local labor conditions changes in government policies and regulations including imposition or increases in withholding and other taxes on remittances and other payments by international subsidiaries as well as the exposure to liabilities under anticorruption laws in various countries such as the us foreign corrupt practices act currency volatility transportation delays or interruptions sovereign debt uncertainties and difficulties in enforcement of contract and intellectual property rights as well as natural disasters should the economic environment in our nonus markets deteriorate from current levels our results of operations and financial position could be materially impacted including as a result of the effects of potential impairment writedowns of goodwill andor other intangible assets related to these businesses 

the reporting currency for snapon’s consolidated financial statements is the us dollar certain of the company’s assets liabilities expenses and revenues are denominated in currencies other than the us dollar in preparing snapon’s consolidated financial statements those assets liabilities expenses and revenues are translated into us dollars at applicable exchange rates increases or decreases in exchange rates between the us dollar and other currencies affect the us dollar value of those items as reflected in the consolidated financial statements substantial fluctuations in the value of the us dollar could have a significant impact on the company’s financial condition and results of operations 

we are also affected by changes in inflation rates and interest rates additionally cash generated in nonus jurisdictions may be difficult to repatriate to the united states in a taxefficient manner our foreign operations are also subject to other risks and challenges such as the need to staff and manage diverse workforces respond to the needs of multiple national and international marketplaces and differing business climates and cultures in various countries 

the recognition of impairment charges on goodwill or other intangible assets would adversely impact our future financial condition and results of operations 

we have a substantial amount of goodwill and purchased intangible assets almost all of which are booked in the commercial  industrial group and in the repair systems  information group we are required to perform impairment tests on our goodwill and other intangibles annually or at any time when events occur that could impact the value of our business segments our determination of whether impairment has occurred is based on a comparison of each of our reporting units’ fair market value with its carrying value significant and unanticipated changes in circumstances such as significant and longterm adverse changes in business climate adverse actions by regulators unanticipated competition the loss of key customers andor changes in technology or markets could require a provision for impairment in a future period that could substantially impact our reported earnings and reduce our consolidated net worth and shareholders’ equity should the economic environment in these markets deteriorate our results of operations and financial position could be materially impacted including as a result of the effects of potential impairment writedowns of goodwill andor other intangible assets related to these businesses 

our operations expose us to the risk of environmental liabilities costs litigation and violations that could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and reputation 

certain of our operations are subject to environmental laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which they operate which impose limitations on the discharge of pollutants into the ground air and water and establish standards for the generation treatment use storage and disposal of hazardous wastes we must also comply with various health and safety regulations in the united states and abroad in connection with our operations failure to comply with any of these laws could result in civil and criminal monetary and nonmonetary penalties and damage to our reputation in addition we may incur costs related to remedial efforts or alleged environmental damage associated with past or current waste disposal practices legislation has been proposed and governmental regulatory action has been both proposed and taken that may significantly impact environmental compliance in the united states these actions could increase our costs of production by raising the cost of energy as well as by further restricting emissions or other processes that we currently use in our operations we cannot provide assurance that our costs of complying with current or future environmental protection and health and safety laws will not exceed our estimates 

  

 

 

  

 

  

the inability to successfully defend claims from taxing authorities could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we conduct business in many countries which requires us to interpret the income tax laws and rulings in each of those taxing jurisdictions due to the subjectivity of tax laws between those jurisdictions as well as the subjectivity of factual interpretations our estimates of income tax liabilities may differ from actual payments or assessments claims from taxing authorities related to these differences could have an adverse impact on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

failure to attract and retain qualified personnel could lead to a loss of revenue andor profitability 

snapon’s success depends in part on the efforts and abilities of its senior management team and other key employees their skills experience and industry contacts significantly benefit our operations and administration the failure to attract and retain members of our senior management team and other key employees could have a negative effect on our operating results in addition transitions of important responsibilities to new individuals inherently include the possibility of disruptions to our business and operations which could negatively affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

the steps taken to restructure operations rationalize operating footprint lower operating expenses and achieve greater efficiencies in the supply chain could disrupt business 

we have taken steps in the past and expect to take additional steps in the future intended to improve customer service and drive further efficiencies and reduce costs some of which could be disruptive to our business these actions collectively across our operating groups are focused on the following 

 

       a failure to succeed in the implementation of any or all of these actions could result in an inability to achieve our financial goals and could be disruptive to the business 

in addition any future reductions to headcount and other cost reduction measures may result in the loss of technical expertise and could adversely affect our research and development efforts as well as our ability to meet product development schedules efforts to reduce components of expense could result in the recording of charges for inventory and technologyrelated writeoffs workforce reduction costs or other charges relating to the consolidation or closure of facilities if we were to incur a substantial charge to further these efforts our earnings per share would be adversely affected in such period if we are unable to effectively manage our cost reduction and restructuring efforts our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows could be negatively affected 

  

 

 

  

 

  

we may not successfully integrate businesses we acquire which could have an adverse impact on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

the pursuit of growth through acquisitions including participation in joint ventures involves significant risks that could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows these risks include

 snapon intends to make contributions of 74 million to its foreign pension plans and 20 million to its domestic pension plans in 2016 as required by law depending on market and other conditions snapon may make discretionary cash contributions to its pension plans in 2016 snapon has not presented estimated pension and postretirement funding contributions in the table above as the funding can vary from year to year based on changes in the fair value of the plan assets and actuarial assumptions see notes 11 and 12 to the consolidated financial statements for information on the company’s benefit plans and payments 

due to the uncertainty of the timing of settlements with taxing authorities snapon is unable to make reasonably reliable estimates of the period of cash settlement of unrecognized tax benefits for its remaining uncertain tax liabilities as a result 72 million of unrecognized tax benefits have been excluded from the table above see note 8 to the consolidated financial statements for information on income taxes

new accounting standards

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the consolidated financial statements and related notes contain information that is pertinent to management’s discussion and analysis the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america “us gaap” requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period these estimates are generally based on historical experience current conditions and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily available from other sources as well as identifying and assessing our accounting treatment with respect to commitments and contingencies actual results could differ from those estimates 

in addition to the company’s significant accounting policies described in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements snapon considers the following policies and estimates to be the most critical in understanding the judgments that are involved in the preparation of the company’s consolidated financial statements and the uncertainties that could impact the company’s financial position results of operations and cash flows 

impairment of goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets are tested for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the assets might be impaired annual impairment tests are performed by the company in the second quarter of each year using information available as of fiscal april month end 

snapon evaluates the recoverability of goodwill by estimating the future discounted cash flows of the businesses to which the goodwill relates estimated cash flows and related goodwill are grouped at the reporting unit level the company has determined that its reporting units for testing goodwill impairment are its operating segments or components of an operating segment that constitute a business for which discrete financial information is available and for which segment management regularly reviews the operating results within its four reportable operating segments the company has identified 11 reporting units 

snapon evaluates the recoverability of goodwill by utilizing an income approach that estimates the fair value of the future discounted cash flows of the reporting units to which the goodwill relates the future projections which are based on both past performance and the projections and assumptions used in the company’s operating plans are subject to change as a result of changing economic and competitive conditions this approach reflects management’s internal outlook at the reporting units which management believes provides the best determination of value due to management’s insight and experience with the reporting unit significant estimates used by management in the discounted cash flows methodology include estimates of future cash flows based on expected growth rates price increases working capital levels expected benefits from rci initiatives and a weightedaverage cost of capital that reflects the specific risk profile of the reporting unit being tested the company’s methodologies for valuing goodwill are applied consistently on a yearoveryear basis the assumptions used in performing the second quarter 2015 impairment calculations were evaluated in light of thencurrent market and business conditions snapon continues to believe that the future discounted cash flow valuation model provides the most reasonable and meaningful fair value estimate based upon the reporting units’ projections of future operating results and cash flows and replicates how market participants would value the company’s reporting units in an orderly transaction 

in the event the fair value of a reporting unit is less than the carrying value including goodwill the company would then perform an additional assessment that would compare the implied fair value of goodwill with the carrying amount of goodwill the determination of implied fair value of goodwill would require management to compare the estimated fair value of the reporting unit to the estimated fair value of the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit if necessary the company may consult with valuation specialists to assist with the assessment of the estimated fair value of the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit if the implied fair value of the goodwill is less than the carrying value an impairment loss would be recorded 

snapon also evaluates the recoverability of its indefinitelived trademarks by utilizing an income approach that estimates the fair value of the future discounted cash flows of each of its trademarks the future projections which are based on both past performance and the projections and assumptions used in the company’s operating plans are subject to change as a result of changing economic and competitive conditions significant estimates used by management in the discounted cash flows methodology include estimates of future cash flows based on expected growth and royalty rates expected synergies and a weightedaverage cost of capital that reflects the specific risk profile of the trademark being tested the company’s methodologies for valuing trademarks are applied consistently on a yearoveryear basis the assumptions used in performing the second quarter 2015 impairment calculations were evaluated in light of thencurrent market and business conditions snapon continues to believe that the future discounted cash flow valuation model provides the most reasonable and meaningful fair value estimate based upon the trademarks’ projected future cash flows and replicates how market participants would value the company’s trademarks in an orderly transaction 

  

 

 

 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued 

 

 

 

  

inherent in fair value determinations are significant judgments and estimates including material assumptions about future revenue profitability and cash flows the company’s operational plans and its interpretation of current economic indicators should the operations of the businesses with which goodwill or other indefinitelived intangible assets are associated incur significant declines in profitability and cash flow due to significant and longterm deterioration in macroeconomic industry and market conditions the loss of key customers changes in technology or markets significant changes in key personnel or litigation a significant and sustained decrease in share price andor other events including effects from the sale or disposal of a reporting unit some or all of the recorded goodwill or other indefinitelived intangible assets could be subject to impairment and could result in a material adverse effect on snapon’s financial position or results of operations 

snapon completed its annual impairment testing of goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets in the second quarter of 2015 the results of which did not result in any impairment as of 2015 year end the company has no accumulated impairment losses although the company consistently uses the same methods in developing the assumptions and estimates underlying the fair value calculations such estimates are uncertain by nature and can vary from actual results in performing its annual impairment testing the company performed a sensitivity analysis on the material assumptions used in the discounted cash flow valuation models for each of its 11 reporting units based on the company’s second quarter 2015 impairment testing and assuming a hypothetical 10 decrease in the estimated fair values of each of its 11 reporting units the hypothetical fair value of each of the company’s 11 reporting units would have been greater than its carrying value see note 6 to the consolidated financial statements for further information about goodwill and other intangible assets 

impairment of longlived and amortized intangible assets snapon performs impairment evaluations of its longlived assets including property plant and equipment and intangible assets with finite lives whenever business conditions or events indicate that those assets may be impaired when the estimated future undiscounted cash flows to be generated by the assets are less than the carrying value of the longlived assets the assets are written down to fair market value and a charge is recorded to current operations 

significant and unanticipated changes in circumstances such as significant declines in profitability and cash flow due to significant and longterm deterioration in macroeconomic industry and market conditions the loss of key customers changes in technology or markets andor other events including effects from the sale or disposal of a reporting unit could require a provision for impairment in a future period 

pension benefits the pension benefit obligation and related pension expense are calculated in accordance with us gaap and are impacted by certain actuarial assumptions changes in these assumptions are primarily influenced by factors outside of snapon’s control and can have a significant effect on the amounts reported in the financial statements snapon believes that the two most critical assumptions are i the expected return on plan assets and ii the assumed discount rate 

pension expense increases as the expected rate of return on plan assets decreases lowering the expected rate of return assumption for snapon’s domestic pension plan assets by 50 bps would have increased snapon’s 2015 domestic pension expense by approximately 46 million snapon uses a threeyear marketrelated value asset method of amortizing the difference between actual and expected returns on its domestic plans’ assets 

the objective of snapon’s discount rate assumption is to reflect the rate at which the pension benefits could be effectively settled in making this determination the company takes into account the timing and amount of benefits that would be available under the plans the domestic discount rate as of 2015 and 2014 year end was selected based on a cash flow matching methodology developed by the company’s outside actuaries and which incorporates a review of current economic conditions this methodology matches the plans’ yearly projected cash flows for benefits and starting in 2015 service costs to those of hypothetical bond portfolios using highquality aa rated or better corporate bonds from either moody’s investors service or standard  poor’s credit rating agencies available at the measurement date this technique calculates bond portfolios that produce adequate cash flows to pay the plans’ projected yearly benefits and then selects the portfolio with the highest yield and uses that yield as the recommended discount rate 

  

 

 

  

 

  

the selection of the 47 weightedaverage discount rate for snapon’s domestic pension plans as of 2015 year end represents the single rate that produces the same present value of cash flows as the estimated benefit plan payments lowering snapon’s domestic discount rate assumption by 50 bps would have increased snapon’s 2015 domestic pension expense and projected benefit obligation by approximately 61 million and 592 million respectively as of 2015 year end snapon’s domestic projected benefit obligation comprised approximately 83 of snapon’s worldwide projected benefit obligation the weightedaverage discount rate for snapon’s foreign pension plans of 37 represents the single rate that produces the same present value of cash flows as the estimated benefit plan payments lowering snapon’s foreign discount rate assumption by 50 bps would have increased snapon’s 2015 foreign pension expense and projected benefit obligation by approximately 17 million and 207 million respectively 

actuarial gains and losses in excess of 10 percent of the greater of the projected benefit obligation or marketrelated value of assets are amortized on a straightline basis over the average remaining service period of active participants or over the average remaining life expectancy for plans with primarily inactive participants prior service costs and credits resulting from plan amendments are amortized in equal annual amounts over the average remaining service period of active participants or over the average remaining life expectancy for plans with primarily inactive participants see note 11 to the consolidated financial statements for further information on pension plans 

outlook 

snapon expects to make continued progress in 2016 along its defined runways for coherent growth leveraging capabilities already demonstrated in the automotive repair arena and developing and expanding its professional customer base not only in automotive repair but in adjacent markets additional geographies and other areas including in critical industries where the cost and penalties for failure can be high in pursuit of these initiatives snapon expects that capital expenditures in 2016 will be in a range of 80 million to 90 million snapon also anticipates that its full year 2016 effective income tax rate will be comparable to its 2015 full year rate 

  

 

 

  

 

  




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

market credit and economic risks 

market risk is the potential economic loss that may result from adverse changes in the fair value of financial instruments snapon is exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates snapon is also exposed to market risk associated with the stockbased portion of its deferred compensation plans snapon monitors its exposure to these risks and attempts to manage the underlying economic exposures through the use of financial instruments such as foreign currency forward contracts interest rate swap agreements treasury lock agreements and prepaid equity forward agreements “equity forwards” snapon does not use derivative instruments for speculative or trading purposes snapon’s broadbased business activities help to reduce the impact that volatility in any particular area or related areas may have on its operating earnings as a whole snapon’s management takes an active role in the risk management process and has developed policies and procedures that require specific administrative and business functions to assist in the identification assessment and control of various risks 

foreign currency risk management 

snapon has significant international operations and is subject to certain risks inherent with foreign operations that include currency fluctuations foreign exchange risk exists to the extent that snapon has payment obligations or receipts denominated in currencies other than the functional currency including intercompany loans denominated in foreign currencies to manage these exposures snapon identifies naturally offsetting positions and then purchases hedging instruments to protect the residual net exposures see note 10 to the consolidated financial statements for information on foreign currency risk management 

interest rate risk management 

snapon aims to control funding costs by managing the exposure created by the differing maturities and interest rate structures of snapon’s borrowings through the use of interest rate swap agreements treasury lock agreements are used from time to time to manage potential changes in interest rates in anticipation of the issuance or sale of certain financial instruments see note 10 to the consolidated financial statements for information on interest rate risk management 

snapon utilizes a valueatrisk “var” model to determine the potential oneday loss in the fair value of its interest rate and foreign exchangesensitive financial instruments from adverse changes in market factors the var model estimates were made assuming normal market conditions and a 95 confidence level snapon’s computations are based on the interrelationships among movements in various currencies and interest rates variancecovariance technique these interrelationships were determined by observing interest rate and foreign currency market changes over the preceding quarter 

the estimated maximum potential oneday loss in fair value calculated using the var model as of 2015 and 2014 year end was 06 million and 12 million respectively on interest ratesensitive financial instruments and 05 million and 04 million respectively on foreign currencysensitive financial instruments the var model is a risk management tool and does not purport to represent actual losses in fair value that will be incurred by snapon nor does it consider the potential effect of favorable changes in market factors 

stockbased deferred compensation risk management 

snapon aims to manage market risk associated with the stockbased portion of its deferred compensation plans through the use of equity forwards equity forwards are used to aid in offsetting the potential marktomarket effect on stockbased deferred compensation from changes in snapon’s stock price since stockbased deferred compensation liabilities increase as the company’s stock price rises and decrease as the company’s stock price declines the equity forwards are intended to mitigate the potential impact on compensation expense that may result from such marktomarket changes see note 10 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on stockbased deferred compensation risk management 

  

 

 

  

 

  

credit risk 

credit risk is the possibility of loss from a customer’s failure to make payments according to contract terms prior to extending credit each customer is evaluated taking into consideration the customer’s financial condition collateral debtservicing ability past payment experience credit bureau information and other financial and qualitative factors that may affect the customer’s ability to repay credit risk is also monitored regularly through the use of internal proprietary custom scoring models used to evaluate each transaction at the time of the application for credit and by periodically updating those credit scores for ongoing monitoring purposes snapon evaluates credit quality through the use of an internal proprietary measuring system that provides a framework to analyze finance and contract receivables on the basis of risk factors of the individual obligor as well as transaction specific risk the finance and contract receivables are typically monitored through an asset quality review process that closely monitors past due accounts and initiates a progressive collection action process when appropriate 

counterparty risk 

snapon is exposed to credit losses in the event of nonperformance by the counterparties to its various financial agreements including its foreign currency forward contracts interest rate swap agreements and prepaid equity forward agreements snapon does not obtain collateral or other security to support financial instruments subject to credit risk but monitors the credit standing of the counterparties and generally enters into agreements with financial institution counterparties with a credit rating of a or better snapon does not anticipate nonperformance by its counterparties but cannot provide assurances 

economic risk 

economic risk is the possibility of loss resulting from economic instability in certain areas of the world snapon continually monitors its exposure in these markets inflation has not had a significant impact on the company 

as a result of the above market credit and economic risks net earnings and revenues in any particular period may not be representative of fullyear results and may vary significantly from year to year 

commodity risk 

snapon is a purchaser of certain commodities such as steel natural gas and electricity the company is also a purchaser of components and parts that are integrated into the company’s end products as well as the purchaser of certain finished goods all of which may contain various commodities including steel aluminum and others snapon’s supply of raw materials and purchased components are generally and readily available from numerous suppliers 

the principal raw material used in the manufacture of the company’s products is steel which the company purchases in competitive pricesensitive markets to meet snapon’s high quality standards the company’s steel needs range from specialized alloys which are available only from a limited group of approved suppliers to commodity types of alloys these raw materials have historically exhibited price and demand cyclicality some of these materials have been and in the future may be in short supply particularly in the event of a general economic recovery mill shutdowns or production cut backs as some steel alloys require specialized manufacturing procedures snapon could experience inventory shortages if it were required to use an alternative manufacturer on short notice additionally unexpected price increases for raw materials could result in higher prices to snapon’s customers or an erosion of the margins on its products 

snapon believes its ability to sell product is also dependent on the number of vehicles on the road the number of miles driven and the general aging of vehicles these factors affect the frequency type and amount of service and repair performed on vehicles by technicians and therefore affect the demand for the number of technicians the prosperity of the technicians and consequently the demand technicians have for the company’s tools other products and services and the value technicians place on those products and services the use of other methods of transportation including more frequent use of public transportation could result in a decrease in the use of privately operated vehicles a decrease in the use of privately operated vehicles may lead to fewer repairs and less demand for the company’s products 

to the extent that commodity prices increase and the company does not have firm pricing agreements with its suppliers the company may experience margin declines to the extent that it is not able to increase the selling prices of its products

sales and distribution 

snapon markets and distributes its products and related services principally to professional tool and equipment users around the world the two largest market sectors are the vehicle service and repair sector and the industrial sector 

vehicle service and repair sector 

the vehicle service and repair sector has three main customer groups i professional technicians who purchase tools and diagnostic and equipment products for themselves ii other professional customers related to vehicle repair including owners and managers of independent repair shops and oem dealerships who purchase tools and diagnostic and equipment products for use by multiple technicians within a service or repair facility and iii oems 

snapon provides innovative tool equipment and business solutions as well as technical sales support and training designed to meet technicians’ evolving needs snapon’s mobile tool distribution system offers technicians the convenience of purchasing quality tools at their place of business with minimal disruption of their work routine snapon also provides owners and managers of repair shops where technicians work with tools diagnostic equipment and repair and service information including electronic parts catalogs and shop management products snapon’s oem facilitation business provides oems with products and services including tools consulting and facilitation services which include product procurement distribution and administrative support to customers for their dealership equipment programs 

the vehicle service and repair sector is characterized by an increasing rate of technological change within motor vehicles vehicle population growth and increasing vehicle life and the resulting effects of these changes on the businesses of both our suppliers and customers snapon believes it is a meaningful participant in the vehicle service and repair market sector 

industrial sector 

snapon markets its products and services globally to a broad crosssection of commercial and industrial customers including maintenance and repair operations manufacturing and assembly facilities various government agencies facilities and operations including military operations vocational and technical schools aviation and aerospace operations oem and service and repair customers oil and gas developers mining operations energy and power

the industrial sector for snapon focuses on providing valueadded products and services to an increasingly expanding global base of customers in critical industries particularly those in the market segments of natural resources aerospace government and technical education through its experienced and dispersed sales organization industrial “solutioneers” develop unique and highly valued productivity solutions for customers worldwide that leverage snapon’s product service and development capabilities 

the industrial sector is characterized by a highly competitive costconscious environment and a trend toward customers making many of their tool and equipment purchases through one integrated supplier snapon believes it is a meaningful participant in the industrial tools and equipment market sector 

distribution channels 

snapon serves customers primarily through the following channels of distribution i the mobile van channel ii company direct sales iii distributors and iv ecommerce the following discussion summarizes snapon’s general approach for each channel and is not intended to be allinclusive 

mobile van channel 

in the united states a significant portion of sales to the vehicle service and repair sector is conducted through snapon’s mobile franchise van channel snapon’s franchisees primarily serve vehicle repair technicians and vehicle service shop owners generally providing weekly contact at the customer’s place of business franchisees’ sales are concentrated in hand and power tools tool storage products shop equipment and diagnostic and repair information products which can easily be transported in a van and demonstrated during a brief sales call franchisees purchase snapon’s products at a discount from suggested list prices and resell them at prices established by the franchisee us franchisees are provided a list of calls that serves as the basis of the franchisee’s sales route 

snapon also provides certain franchisees the opportunity to add vans to their franchise or to add a limited number of additional franchises snapon charges nominal initial and ongoing monthly franchise fees since 1991 written franchise agreements have been entered into with all new us franchisees 

snapon previously offered an option termed the “gateway franchise program” to certain potential us franchisees including those that did not meet the standard franchise qualification requirements gateway franchise program participants had less upfront investment and were provided an initial base level of consigned inventory from snapon to assist them in gaining experience and building equity toward the future purchase of a standard franchise snapon ceased offering new gateway franchises in february 2013 and anticipates not having any remaining gateway franchises by the end of february 2015 as of 2014 year end five of snapon’s us franchised routes were operated as gateway franchises 

snapon also has a companyowned van program in the united states that is designed to i provide another pool of potential franchisees and field organization personnel ii service customers in select new andor open routes not currently serviced by franchisees and iii allow snapon to pilot new sales and promotional ideas prior to introducing them to franchisees as of 2014 year end companyowned vans comprised approximately 5 of the total us van population snapon may elect to increase or reduce the number of companyowned vans in the future 

in addition to its mobile van channel in the united states snapon has replicated its us franchise distribution model in certain other countries including australia canada germany japan the united kingdom the netherlands south africa new zealand belgium and ireland in many of these markets as in the united states purchase decisions are generally made or influenced by professional vehicle service technicians as well as repair shop owners and managers as of 2014 year end snapon’s worldwide mobile van count was approximately 4800 vans including approximately 3500 vans in the united states 

through soc financing is available to us franchisees including financing for van leases working capital loans and loans to help enable new franchisees to fund the purchase of the franchise in many international markets snapon offers a variety of financing options to its franchisees andor customer networks through its international finance subsidiaries the decision to finance through snapon or another financing entity is solely at the customer’s election 

  

 

 

  

 

  

snapon supports its franchisees with a field organization of regional offices franchise performance teams diagnostic sales developers “dsds” customer care centers and distribution centers snapon also provides sales and business training and marketing and product promotion programs as well as customer and franchisee financing programs through soc and the company’s international finance subsidiaries all of which are designed to strengthen franchisee sales in north america the united states national franchise advisory council and the canadian national franchise advisory council both of which are composed primarily of franchisees that are elected by franchisees assist snapon in identifying and implementing enhancements to the franchise program 

in the united states franchisees work closely with dsds the dsds train franchisees on the sale of higherpricepoint diagnostics and demonstrate and sell vehicle service shop management and information systems dsds work independently and with franchisees to identify and generate sales among vehicle service technicians and repair shop owners and managers dsds are snapon employees who are compensated through a combination of base salary and commission a franchisee receives a brokerage fee from certain sales made by the dsds to the franchisee’s customers most products sold through franchisees and dsds are sold under the snapon bluepoint and shopkey brand names 

company direct sales 

a significant proportion of shop equipment sales in north america under the john bean hofmann blackhawk challenger and procut brands diagnostic products under the snapon brand and information products under the mitchell1 brand are made by direct and independent sales forces that have responsibility for national and other accounts as the vehicle service and repair sector consolidates with more business conducted by national chains and franchised service centers snapon believes these larger organizations can be serviced most effectively by sales people who can demonstrate and sell the full line of diagnostic and equipment products and services snapon also sells these products and services directly to oems and their franchised dealers 

snapon brand tools and equipment are marketed to industrial and governmental customers in the united states through both industrial sales representatives who are employees and independent industrial distributors outside of the united states industrial sales are also conducted through other independent distributors sales representatives focus on industrial customers whose main purchase criteria are quality and integrated solutions as of 2014 year end snapon had industrial sales representatives in the united states including puerto rico australia canada japan mexico and various european asian latin american middle eastern and african countries with the united states representing the majority of snapon’s total industrial sales 

snapon also sells software services and solutions to the automotive commercial agriculture power equipment and power sports segments products and services are marketed to targeted groups including oems and their dealerships fleets and individual repair shops to effectively reach oems which frequently have a multinational presence snapon has deployed focused business teams globally 

distributors 

sales of certain tools and equipment are made through independent distributors who purchase the items from snapon and resell them to end users hand tools under the bahco fish and hook lindström and williams brands and trade names for example are sold through distributors in europe north and south america asia and certain other parts of the world wheel service and other vehicle service equipment are sold through distributors primarily under brands including hofmann john bean challenger procut cartec and blackhawk diagnostic and equipment products are marketed through distributors in south america and asia and through both a direct sales force and distributors in europe under the snapon sun bahco and bluepoint brands 

ecommerce 

snapon’s ecommerce development initiatives allow snapon to combine the capabilities of the internet with snapon’s existing brand sales and distribution strengths to reach new and underserved customer segments snapon offers current and prospective customers online aroundtheclock access to research and purchase products through its public internet website at wwwsnaponcom  the site features an online catalog of snapon hand tools power tools tool storage units and diagnostic equipment available to customers in the united states the united kingdom canada and australia ecommerce and certain other system enhancement initiatives are designed to improve productivity and further leverage the oneonone relationships and service snapon has with its current and prospective customers sales through the company’s ecommerce distribution channel were not significant in any of the last three years 

  

 

 

  

 

  

competition 

snapon competes on the basis of its product quality and performance product line breadth and depth service brand awareness and imagery technological innovation and availability of financing through soc or its international finance subsidiaries while snapon does not believe that any single company competes with it across all of its product lines and distribution channels various companies compete in one or more product categories andor distribution channels 

snapon believes it is a leading manufacturer and distributor of professional tools tool storage diagnostic and equipment products and repair software and solutions offering a broad line of these products to both vehicle service and industrial marketplaces various competitors target and sell to professional technicians in the vehicle service and repair sector through the mobile tool distribution channel snapon also competes with companies that sell tools and equipment to vehicle service and repair technicians through retail stores and online vehicle parts supply outlets and tool supply warehousesdistributorships within the power tools category and the industrial sector snapon has various other competitors including companies with offerings that overlap with other areas discussed herein major competitors selling diagnostics shop equipment and information to vehicle dealerships and independent repair shops include oems and their proprietary electronic parts catalogs as well as diagnostics and information systems and other companies that offer products serving this sector 

raw materials and purchased product 

snapon’s supply of raw materials and purchased components are generally and readily available from numerous suppliers snapon believes it has secured an ample supply of both bar and coil steel for the near future to ensure stable supply to meet material demands the company does not currently anticipate experiencing any significant impact in 2015 from steel pricing or availability issues 

patents trademarks and other intellectual property 

snapon vigorously pursues and relies on patent protection to protect its intellectual property and position in its markets as of 2014 year end snapon and its subsidiaries held approximately 700 active and pending patents in the united states and approximately 1500 active and pending patents outside of the united states sales relating to any single patent did not represent a material portion of snapon’s revenues in any of the last three years 

examples of products that have features or designs that benefit from patent protection include wheel alignment systems wheel balancers tire changers vehicle lifts test lanes brake lathes sealed ratchets electronic torque instruments ratcheting screwdrivers emissionssensing devices and diagnostic equipment 

much of the technology used in the manufacture of vehicle service tools and equipment is in the public domain snapon relies primarily on trade secret protection to protect proprietary processes used in manufacturing methods and processes are patented when appropriate copyright protection is also utilized when appropriate 

trademarks used by snapon are of continuing importance to snapon in the marketplace trademarks have been registered in the united states and more than 120 other countries and additional applications for trademark registrations are pending snapon vigorously polices proper use of its trademarks snapon’s right to manufacture and sell certain products is dependent upon licenses from others however these products under license do not represent a material portion of snapon’s net sales 

domain names have become a valuable corporate asset for companies around the world including snapon domain names often contain a trademark or service mark or even a corporate name and are often considered intellectual property the recognition and value of the snapon name trademark and domain name are core strengths of the company

snapon believes that it complies with applicable environmental control requirements in its operations expenditures on environmental matters through eh  sms have not had and snapon does not for the foreseeable future expect them to have a material effect upon snapon’s capital expenditures earnings or competitive position 

employees 

snapon employed approximately 11400 people at the end of january 2015 snapon employed approximately 11300 people at the end of january 2014 

approximately 2600 employees or 23 of snapon’s worldwide workforce are represented by unions andor covered under collective bargaining agreements the number of covered union employees whose contracts expire over the next five years approximates 1250 employees in 2015 400 employees in 2016 and 600 employees in 2017 there are no contracts currently scheduled to expire in 2018 or 2019 in recent years snapon has not experienced any significant work slowdowns stoppages or other labor disruptions 

there can be no assurance that these and other future contracts with snapon’s unions will be renegotiated upon terms acceptable to snapon 

working capital 

most of snapon’s businesses are not seasonal and their inventory needs are relatively constant snapon did not have a significant backlog of orders at 2014 year end in recent years snapon has been using its working capital to fund in part the continued growth of the company’s financial services portfolio 

snapon’s liquidity and capital resources and use of working capital are discussed herein in “part ii item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” 

as of 2014 year end neither snapon nor any of its segments depend on any single customer small group of customers or government for any material part of its revenues 




 item 1a risk factors 

in evaluating the company careful consideration should be given to the following risk factors in addition to the other information included in this annual report on form 10k including the consolidated financial statements and the related notes each of these risk factors could adversely affect the company’s business operating results cash flows andor financial condition as well as adversely affect the value of an investment in the company’s common stock 

economic conditions and world events could affect our operating results 

we our franchisees and our customers may be adversely affected by changing economic conditions including conditions that may particularly impact specific regions these conditions may result in reduced consumer and investor confidence instability in the credit and financial markets volatile corporate profits and reduced business and consumer spending we our franchisees and our customers and the economy as a whole also may be affected by future world or local events outside our control such as acts of terrorism developments in the war on terrorism conflicts in international situations and natural disasters as well as governmentrelated developments or issues these factors may affect our results of operations by reducing our sales margins andor net earnings as a result of a slowdown in customer orders or order cancellations impact the availability of raw materials andor the supply chain and could potentially lead to future impairment of our intangible assets in addition political and social turmoil related to international conflicts and terrorist acts may put pressure on economic conditions abroad unstable political social and economic conditions may make it difficult for our franchisees customers suppliers and us to accurately forecast and plan future business activities if such conditions persist our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows could be negatively affected 

  

 

 

  

 

  

raw material and energy price fluctuations and shortages including steel and various fuel sources could adversely affect the ability to obtain needed manufacturing materials and could adversely affect our results of operations 

the principal raw material used in the manufacture of our products is steel which we purchase in competitive pricesensitive markets to meet snapon’s high quality standards our steel needs range from specialized alloys which are available only from a limited group of approved suppliers to commodity types of alloys these raw materials have historically exhibited price and demand cyclicality some of these materials have been and in the future may be in short supply particularly in the event of mill shutdowns or production cut backs as some steel alloys require specialized manufacturing procedures we could experience inventory shortages if we were required to use an alternative manufacturer on short notice additionally unexpected price increases for raw materials could result in higher prices to our customers or an erosion of the margins on our products 

we believe our ability to sell our products is also dependent on the number of vehicles on the road the number of miles driven and the general aging of vehicles these factors affect the frequency type and amount of service and repair performed on vehicles by technicians and therefore affect the demand for the number of technicians the prosperity of technicians and consequently the demand technicians have for our tools other products and services and the value technicians place on those products and services to the extent that the prices of gasoline and other petroleumbased fuels increase as they have at times in recent years consumers may turn to other methods of transportation including more frequent use of public transportation which could result in a decrease in the use of privately operated vehicles a decrease in the use of privately operated vehicles may lead to fewer repairs and less demand for our products 

we use various energy sources to transport produce and distribute products and some of our products have components that are petroleum based petroleum and energy prices have periodically increased significantly over short periods of time further volatility and changes may be caused by market fluctuations supply and demand currency fluctuation production and transportation disruption world events and changes in governmental programs energy price increases raise both our operating costs and the costs of our materials and we may not be able to increase our prices enough to offset these costs higher prices also may reduce the level of future customer orders and our profitability 

the performance of snapon’s mobile tool distribution business depends on the success of its franchisees 

approximately 42 of our 2014 revenues were generated by the snapon tools group which consists of snapon’s business operations serving the worldwide mobile tool distribution channel except in limited circumstances each of our mobile tool vans is operated by a franchisee pursuant to a franchise agreement snapon’s success is dependent on its relationships with franchisees individually and collectively as they are the primary sales and service link between the company and vehicle service and repair technicians who are an important class of end users for snapon’s products and services if our franchisees are not successful or if we do not maintain an effective relationship with our franchisees the delivery of products the collection of receivables andor our relationship with end users could be adversely affected and thereby negatively impact our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

in addition if we are unable to maintain effective relationships with franchisees snapon or the franchisees may choose to terminate the relationship which may result in i open routes in which enduser customers are not provided reliable service ii litigation resulting from termination iii reduced collections or increased writeoffs of franchisee receivables owed to snapon andor iv reduced collections or increased writeoffs of extended credit contracts 

new and stricter legislation and regulations may affect our business reputation results of operations and financial condition 

increased legislative and regulatory activity and burdens and a more stringent manner in which they are applied could significantly impact our business and the economy as a whole for example the affordable care act the “aca” which was adopted in 2010 and is being phased in over several years significantly affects the provision of both health care services and benefits in the united states the aca may impact our cost of providing our employees and retirees with health insurance andor benefits and may also impact various other aspects of our business the aca did not have a material impact on our fiscal 2014 2013 or 2012 financial results however we are continuing to assess the impact of the aca on our health care benefit costs 

financial services businesses of all kinds are subject to increasing regulation and enforcement in addition to potentially increasing the costs of doing business due to compliance obligations new laws and regulations or changes to existing 

  

 

 

  

 

  

laws and regulations as well as the enforcement thereof may affect the relationships between creditors and debtors inhibit the rights of creditors to collect amounts owed to them expand liability for certain actions or inactions or limit the types of financial products or services offered any or all of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows failure to comply with any of these laws or regulations could also result in penalties and damage to our reputation andor the incurrence of remediation costs 

these developments and other potential future legislation and regulations as well as the increasingly strict regulatory environment may also adversely affect the customers to which and the markets into which we sell our products and increase our costs and otherwise negatively affect our business reputation results of operations and financial condition including in ways that cannot yet be foreseen 

exposure to credit risks of customers and resellers may make it difficult to collect receivables and could adversely affect operating results and financial condition 

a decline in industry andor economic conditions could have the potential to weaken the financial position of some of our customers if circumstances surrounding our customers’ ability to repay their credit obligations were to deteriorate and result in the writedown or writeoff of such receivables it would negatively affect our operating results for the period in which they occur and if large could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

our inability to provide acceptable financing alternatives to enduser customers and franchisees could adversely impact our operating results 

an integral component of our business and profitability is our ability to offer competitive financing alternatives to enduser customers and franchisees the lack of our ability to obtain capital resources or other financing to support our receivables on terms that we believe are attractive whether resulting from the state of the financial markets our own operating performance or other factors would negatively affect our operating results and financial condition adverse fluctuations in interest rates andor our ability to provide competitive financing programs could also have an adverse impact on our revenue and profitability 

failure to achieve expected investment returns on pension plan assets as well as changes in interest rates or plan demographics could adversely impact our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

snapon sponsors various defined benefit pension plans the “pension plans” the assets of the pension plans are broadly diversified in an attempt to mitigate the risk of a large loss the assets are invested in equity securities debt securities hedge funds real estate and other real assets insurance contracts and cash and cash equivalents required funding for the company’s domestic defined benefit pension plans is determined in accordance with guidelines set forth in the federal employee retirement income security act “erisa” foreign defined benefit pension plans are funded in accordance with local statutes or practice additional contributions to enhance the funded status of the pension plans can be made at the company’s discretion however there can be no assurance that the value of the pension plan assets or the investment returns on those plan assets will be sufficient to meet the future benefit obligations of such plans in addition during periods of adverse investment market conditions and declining interest rates the company may be required to make additional cash contributions to the pension plans that could reduce our financial flexibility changes in plan demographics including an increase in the number of retirements or changes in life expectancy assumptions may also increase the costs and funding requirements of the obligations related to the company’s pension plans 

our pension plan obligations are affected by changes in market interest rates significant fluctuations in market interest rates have added and may further add volatility to our pension plan obligations in periods of declining market interest rates our pension plan obligations generally increase in periods of increasing market interest rates our pension plan obligations generally decrease while our plan assets are broadly diversified there are inherent market risks associated with investments if adverse market conditions occur our plan assets could incur significant or material losses since we may need to make additional contributions to address changes in obligations andor a loss in plan assets the combination of declining market interest rates past or future plan asset investment losses andor changes in plan demographics could adversely impact our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

the company’s pension plan expense is comprised of the following factors i service cost ii interest on projected benefit obligations iii the expected return on plan assets iv the amortization of prior service costs and credits v the effects of actuarial gains and losses and vi settlementcurtailment costs when applicable the accounting for pensions 

  

 

 

  

 

  

involves the estimation of a number of factors that are highly uncertain certain factors such as the interest on projected benefit obligations and the expected return on pension plan assets are impacted by changes in market interest rates and the value of plan assets a significant decrease in market interest rates and a decrease in the fair value of pension plan assets would increase net pension expense and may adversely affect the company’s future results of operations see note 11 to the consolidated financial statements for further information on the company’s pension plans 

adverse developments in the credit and financial markets could negatively impact the availability of credit that we and our customers need to operate our businesses 

we depend upon the availability of credit to operate our business including the financing of receivables from enduser customers that are originated by our financial services businesses our enduser customers franchisees and suppliers also require access to credit for their businesses at times in recent years world financial markets have been unstable and subject to uncertainty adverse developments in the credit and financial markets or unfavorable changes in snapon’s credit rating could negatively impact the availability of future financing and the terms on which it might be available to snapon its enduser customers franchisees and suppliers inability to access credit or capital markets or a deterioration in the terms on which financing might be available could have an adverse impact on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

increasing our financial leverage could affect our operations and profitability 

the maximum available credit under our multicurrency revolving credit facility is 700 million the company’s leverage ratio may affect both our availability of additional capital resources as well as our operations in several ways including 

 

     while we believe we will have the ability to service our debt and obtain additional resources in the future if and when needed that will depend upon our results of operations and financial position at the time the thencurrent state of the credit and financial markets and other factors that may be beyond our control therefore we cannot give assurances that credit will be available on terms that we consider attractive or at all if and when necessary or beneficial to us 

data security and information technology infrastructure and security are critical to supporting business objectives failure of our systems to operate effectively could adversely affect our business and reputation 

we depend heavily on information technology infrastructure to achieve our business objectives and to protect sensitive information and continually invest in improving such systems problems that impair or compromise this infrastructure including due to natural disasters security breaches or malicious attacks or during system upgrades andor new system implementations could impede our ability to record or process orders manufacture and ship in a timely manner account for and collect receivables protect sensitive data of the company our customers our suppliers and business partners or otherwise carry on business in the normal course any such events if significant could cause us to lose customers andor revenue and could require us to incur significant expense to remediate including as a result of legal or regulatory claims or proceedings and could also damage our reputation 

in association with initiatives to better integrate business units rationalize operating footprint and improve responsiveness to franchisees and customers snapon is continually replacing and enhancing its global enterprise resource planning erp management information systems as we integrate implement and deploy new information technology processes and a common information infrastructure across our global operations we could experience disruptions in our business that could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

failure to maintain effective distribution of products and services could adversely impact revenue gross margin and profitability 

  

 

 

  

 

  

we use a variety of distribution methods to sell our products and services successfully managing the interaction of our distribution efforts to reach various potential customer segments for our products and services is a complex process moreover since each distribution method has distinct risks costs and gross margins our failure to implement the most advantageous balance in the delivery model for our products and services could adversely affect our revenue and gross margins and therefore our profitability 

risks associated with the disruption of manufacturing operations could adversely affect profitability or competitive position 

we manufacture a significant portion of the products we sell any prolonged disruption in the operations of our existing manufacturing facilities whether due to technical or labor difficulties facility consolidation or closure actions lack of raw material or component availability destruction of or damage to any facility as a result of natural disasters use and storage of hazardous materials or other events or other reasons could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

the inability to continue to introduce new products that respond to customer needs and achieve market acceptance could result in lower revenues and reduced profitability 

sales from new products represent a significant portion of our net sales and are expected to continue to represent a significant component of our future net sales we may not be able to compete effectively unless we continue to enhance existing products or introduce new products to the marketplace in a timely manner product improvements and new product introductions require significant financial and other resources including significant planning design development and testing at the technological product and manufacturing process levels our competitors’ new products may beat our products to market be more effective with more features be less expensive than our products andor render our products obsolete any new products that we develop may not receive market acceptance or otherwise generate any meaningful net sales or profits for us relative to our expectations based on among other things existing and anticipated investments in manufacturing capacity and commitments to fund advertising marketing promotional programs and research and development 

the global tool equipment and diagnostics and repair information industries are competitive 

we face strong competition in all of our market segments price competition in our various industries is intense and pricing pressures from competitors and customers are increasing in general as a manufacturer and marketer of premium products and services the expectations of snapon’s customers and its franchisees are high and continue to increase any inability to maintain customer satisfaction could diminish snapon’s premium image and reputation and could result in a lessening of our ability to command premium pricing we expect that the level of competition will remain high in the future which could limit our ability to maintain or increase market share or profitability 

product liability claims and litigation could affect our business reputation financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

the products that we design andor manufacture andor the services we provide can lead to product liability claims or other legal claims being filed against us to the extent that plaintiffs are successful in showing either that defects in the design or manufacture of our products led to personal injury or property damage or that our provision of services resulted in similar injury or damage we may be subject to claims for damages although we are insured for damages above a certain amount we bear the costs and expenses associated with defending claims including frivolous lawsuits and are responsible for damages below the insurance retention amount as a manufacturer we can be subject to the costs and potential negative publicity of product recalls which could impact our results 

the recognition of impairment charges on goodwill or other intangible assets would adversely impact our future financial condition and results of operations 

we have a substantial amount of goodwill and purchased intangible assets almost all of which are booked in the commercial  industrial group and in the repair systems  information group we are required to perform impairment tests on our goodwill and other intangibles annually or at any time when events occur that could impact the value of our business segments our determination of whether impairment has occurred is based on a comparison of each of our reporting units’ fair market value with its carrying value significant and unanticipated changes in circumstances such as significant and longterm adverse changes in business climate adverse actions by regulators unanticipated competition 

  

 

 

  

 

  

the loss of key customers andor changes in technology or markets could require a provision for impairment in a future period that could substantially impact our reported earnings and reduce our consolidated net worth and shareholders’ equity should the economic environment in these markets deteriorate our results of operations and financial position could be materially impacted including as a result of the effects of potential impairment writedowns of goodwill andor other intangible assets related to these businesses 

failure to adequately protect intellectual property could adversely affect our business 

intellectual property rights are an important and integral component of our business we attempt to protect our intellectual property rights through a combination of patent trademark copyright and trade secret laws as well as licensing agreements and thirdparty nondisclosure and assignment agreements adverse determinations in a judicial or administrative proceeding could prevent us from manufacturing and selling our products or prevent us from stopping others from manufacturing and selling competing products failure to obtain or maintain adequate protection of our intellectual property rights for any reason could have a material adverse effect on our business 

foreign operations are subject to political economic currency exchange and other risks that could adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

approximately 34 of our revenues in 2014 were generated outside of the united states future growth rates and success of our business depends in large part on continued growth in our nonus operations including growth in emerging markets and critical industries numerous risks and uncertainties affect our nonus operations these risks and uncertainties include political economic and social instability such as acts of war civil disturbance or acts of terrorism local labor conditions changes in government policies and regulations including imposition or increases in withholding and other taxes on remittances and other payments by international subsidiaries as well as the exposure to liabilities under anticorruption laws in various countries such as the us foreign corrupt practices act currency instability transportation delays or interruptions sovereign debt uncertainties and difficulties in enforcement of contract and intellectual property rights as well as natural disasters should the economic environment in our nonus markets deteriorate from current levels our results of operations and financial position could be materially impacted including as a result of the effects of potential impairment writedowns of goodwill andor other intangible assets related to these businesses 

the reporting currency for snapon’s consolidated financial statements is the us dollar certain of the company’s assets liabilities expenses and revenues are denominated in currencies other than the us dollar in preparing snapon’s consolidated financial statements those assets liabilities expenses and revenues are translated into us dollars at applicable exchange rates increases or decreases in exchange rates between the us dollar and other currencies affect the us dollar value of those items as reflected in the consolidated financial statements substantial fluctuations in the value of the us dollar could have a significant impact on the company’s financial condition and results of operations 

we are also affected by changes in inflation rates and interest rates additionally cash generated in nonus jurisdictions may be difficult to repatriate to the united states in a taxefficient manner our foreign operations are also subject to other risks and challenges such as the need to staff and manage diverse workforces respond to the needs of multiple national and international marketplaces and differing business climates and cultures in various countries 

  

 

 

  

 

  

our operations expose us to the risk of environmental liabilities costs litigation and violations that could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and reputation 

certain of our operations are subject to environmental laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which they operate which impose limitations on the discharge of pollutants into the ground air and water and establish standards for the generation treatment use storage and disposal of hazardous wastes we must also comply with various health and safety regulations in the united states and abroad in connection with our operations failure to comply with any of these laws could result in civil and criminal monetary and nonmonetary penalties and damage to our reputation in addition we may incur costs related to remedial efforts or alleged environmental damage associated with past or current waste disposal practices legislation has been proposed and governmental regulatory action has been both proposed and taken that may significantly impact environmental compliance in the united states these actions could increase our costs of production by raising the cost of energy as well as by further restricting emissions or other processes that we currently use in our operations we cannot provide assurance that our costs of complying with current or future environmental protection and health and safety laws will not exceed our estimates 

legal disputes could adversely affect our business reputation financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

from time to time we are subject to legal disputes that are being litigated andor settled in the ordinary course of business disputes or future lawsuits could result in the diversion of management’s time and attention away from business operations additionally negative developments with respect to legal disputes and the costs incurred in defending ourselves could have an adverse impact on the company and its reputation adverse outcomes or settlements could also require us to pay damages potentially in excess of amounts reserved or incur liability for other remedies that could have a material adverse effect on our business reputation financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

the inability to successfully defend claims from taxing authorities could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we conduct business in many countries which requires us to interpret the income tax laws and rulings in each of those taxing jurisdictions due to the subjectivity of tax laws between those jurisdictions as well as the subjectivity of factual interpretations our estimates of income tax liabilities may differ from actual payments or assessments claims from taxing authorities related to these differences could have an adverse impact on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

compliance with regulations related to conflict minerals could increase costs and affect the manufacturing and sale of our products 

public companies are required to disclose the use of tin tantalum tungsten and gold collectively “conflict minerals” mined from the democratic republic of the congo and adjoining countries the “covered countries” if a conflict minerals is necessary to the functionality of a product manufactured or contracted to be manufactured by the company 

we may determine as part of our compliance efforts that certain products or components we obtain from our suppliers contain conflict minerals if we are unable to conclude that all our products are free from conflict minerals originating from covered countries this could have a negative impact on our business reputation andor results of operations we may also encounter challenges to satisfy customers who require that our products be certified as conflict free which could place us at a competitive disadvantage if we are unable to substantiate such a claim compliance with these rules could also affect the sourcing and availability of some of the minerals used in the manufacture of products or components we obtain from our suppliers including our ability to obtain products or components in sufficient quantities andor at competitive prices 

  

 

 

  

 

  

the accounting for certain stockbased compensation awards and stockbased deferred compensation liabilities could adversely affect our results of operations 

certain stockbased compensation awards granted by the company are subject to marktomarket accounting treatment which requires us to recognize changes in the fair value of these awards each period based on the company’s periodend stock price volatility in the company’s stock price including as a result of macroeconomic conditions and other factors beyond our control could increase or decrease this expense in future periods while we have entered into prepaid equity forward agreements to manage a portion of the market risk associated with stockbased deferred compensation liabilities depending on changes in the company’s periodend stock price the application of marktomarket accounting on certain of our other stockbased compensation awards and stockbased deferred compensation liabilities could have an adverse effect or favorable benefit on our financial condition and results of operations in certain periods 

failure to attract and retain qualified personnel could lead to a loss of revenue andor profitability 

snapon’s success depends in part on the efforts and abilities of its senior management team and other key employees their skills experience and industry contacts significantly benefit our operations and administration the failure to attract and retain members of our senior management team and other key employees could have a negative effect on our operating results in addition transitions of important responsibilities to new individuals inherently include the possibility of disruptions to our business and operations which could negatively affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

the steps taken to restructure operations rationalize operating footprint lower operating expenses and achieve greater efficiencies in the supply chain could disrupt business 

we have taken steps in the past and expect to take additional steps in the future intended to improve customer service and drive further efficiencies and reduce costs some of which could be disruptive to our business these actions collectively across our operating groups are focused on the following 

 

       a failure to succeed in the implementation of any or all of these actions could result in an inability to achieve our financial goals and could be disruptive to the business 

in addition any future reductions to headcount and other cost reduction measures may result in the loss of technical expertise and could adversely affect our research and development efforts as well as our ability to meet product development schedules efforts to reduce components of expense could result in the recording of charges for inventory and technologyrelated writeoffs workforce reduction costs or other charges relating to the consolidation or closure of facilities if we were to incur a substantial charge to further these efforts our earnings per share would be adversely affected in such period if we are unable to effectively manage our cost reduction and restructuring efforts our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows could be negatively affected 

  

 

 

  

 

  

we may not successfully integrate businesses we acquire which could have an adverse impact on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

the pursuit of growth through acquisitions including participation in joint ventures involves significant risks that could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows these risks include

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

management overview 

we believe our broadbased organic sales growth in 2014 affirms snapon’s unique capabilities in providing repeatability and reliability to a wide range of professional customers performing critical tasks in workplaces of consequence leveraging capabilities already demonstrated in the automotive repair arena our “coherent growth” strategy focuses on developing and expanding our professional customer base not only in automotive repair but in adjacent markets additional geographies and other areas including in critical industries where the cost and penalties for failure can be high 

we believe our 2014 operating results also provide continued evidence that snapon’s value proposition of making work easier for serious professionals in workplaces of consequence is an ongoing strength as we move forward along our runways for coherent growth enhancing the franchise network expanding in the vehicle repair garage extending to critical industries and building in emerging markets we also believe our yearoveryear improvement in operating margin further evidences the potential of our snapon value creation processes – our suite of strategic principles and processes we employ every day designed to create value and employed in the areas of safety quality customer connection innovation and rapid continuous improvement 

in 2014 we continued to invest in our most important strategic growth initiatives aimed at enhancing the franchisee network expanding in the vehicle repair garage extending in critical industries and building in emerging markets recent examples of our continued investment and expansion initiatives include the may 2014 acquisition of procut international inc “procut” and the may 2013 acquisition of challenger lifts inc “challenger” which are further discussed in “results of operations” below the acquisitions of both the procut and challenger product lines complemented and increased our existing undercar equipment product offering broadened our established capabilities in serving vehicle repair facilities and expanded our presence with repair shop owners and managers

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the consolidated financial statements and related notes contain information that is pertinent to management’s discussion and analysis the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america “us gaap” requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period these estimates are generally based on historical experience current conditions and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily available from other sources as well as identifying and assessing our accounting treatment with respect to commitments and contingencies actual results could differ from those estimates 

in addition to the company’s significant accounting policies described in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements snapon considers the following policies and estimates to be the most critical in understanding the judgments that are involved in the preparation of the company’s consolidated financial statements and the uncertainties that could impact the company’s financial position results of operations and cash flows 

impairment of goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets are tested for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the assets might be impaired annual impairment tests are performed by the company in the second quarter of each year 

snapon evaluates the recoverability of goodwill by estimating the future discounted cash flows of the businesses to which the goodwill relates estimated cash flows and related goodwill are grouped at the reporting unit level the company has determined that its reporting units for testing goodwill impairment are its operating segments or components of an operating segment that constitute a business for which discrete financial information is available and for which segment management regularly reviews the operating results within its four reportable operating segments the company has identified 11 reporting units 

snapon evaluates the recoverability of goodwill by utilizing an income approach that estimates the fair value of the future discounted cash flows of the reporting units to which the goodwill relates the future projections which are based on both past performance and the projections and assumptions used in the company’s operating plans are subject to change as a result of changing economic and competitive conditions this approach reflects management’s internal outlook at the reporting units which management believes provides the best determination of value due to management’s insight and experience with the reporting unit significant estimates used by management in the discounted cash flows methodology include estimates of future cash flows based on expected growth rates price increases working capital levels expected benefits from rci initiatives and a weightedaverage cost of capital that reflects the specific risk profile of the reporting unit being tested the company’s methodologies for valuing goodwill are applied consistently on a yearoveryear basis the assumptions used in performing the second quarter 2014 impairment calculations were evaluated in light of thencurrent market and business conditions snapon continues to believe that the future discounted cash flow valuation model provides the most reasonable and meaningful fair value estimate based upon the reporting units’ projections of future operating results and cash flows and replicates how market participants would value the company’s reporting units in an orderly transaction 

in the event the fair value of a reporting unit is less than the carrying value including goodwill the company would then perform an additional assessment that would compare the implied fair value of goodwill with the carrying amount of goodwill the determination of implied fair value of goodwill would require management to compare the estimated fair value of the reporting unit to the estimated fair value of the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit if necessary the company may consult with valuation specialists to assist with the assessment of the estimated fair value of the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit if the implied fair value of the goodwill is less than the carrying value an impairment loss would be recorded 

snapon also evaluates the recoverability of its indefinitelived trademarks by utilizing an income approach that estimates the fair value of the future discounted cash flows of each of its trademarks the future projections which are based on both past performance and the projections and assumptions used in the company’s operating plans are subject to change as a result of changing economic and competitive conditions significant estimates used by management in the discounted cash flows methodology include estimates of future cash flows based on expected growth and royalty rates expected synergies and a weightedaverage cost of capital that reflects the specific risk profile of the trademark being tested the company’s methodologies for valuing trademarks are applied consistently on a yearoveryear basis the 

  

 

 

  

 

  

assumptions used in performing the second quarter 2014 impairment calculations were evaluated in light of thencurrent market and business conditions snapon continues to believe that the future discounted cash flow valuation model provides the most reasonable and meaningful fair value estimate based upon the trademarks’ projected future cash flows and replicates how market participants would value the company’s trademarks in an orderly transaction 

inherent in fair value determinations are significant judgments and estimates including material assumptions about future revenue profitability and cash flows the company’s operational plans and its interpretation of current economic indicators should the operations of the businesses with which goodwill or other indefinitelived intangible assets are associated incur significant declines in profitability and cash flow due to significant and longterm deterioration in macroeconomic industry and market conditions the loss of key customers changes in technology or markets significant changes in key personnel or litigation a significant and sustained decrease in share price andor other events including effects from the sale or disposal of a reporting unit some or all of the recorded goodwill or other indefinitelived intangible assets could be subject to impairment and could result in a material adverse effect on snapon’s financial position or results of operations 

snapon completed its annual impairment testing of goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets in the second quarter of 2014 the results of which did not result in any impairment as of 2014 year end the company has no accumulated impairment losses although the company consistently uses the same methods in developing the assumptions and estimates underlying the fair value calculations such estimates are uncertain by nature and can vary from actual results in performing its annual impairment testing the company performed a sensitivity analysis on the material assumptions used in the discounted cash flow valuation models for each of its 11 reporting units based on the company’s second quarter 2014 impairment testing and assuming a hypothetical 10 decrease in the estimated fair values of each of its 11 reporting units the hypothetical fair value of each of the company’s 11 reporting units would have been greater than its carrying value see note 6 to the consolidated financial statements for further information about goodwill and other intangible assets 

impairment of longlived and amortized intangible assets snapon performs impairment evaluations of its longlived assets including property plant and equipment and intangible assets with finite lives whenever business conditions or events indicate that those assets may be impaired when the estimated future undiscounted cash flows to be generated by the assets are less than the carrying value of the longlived assets the assets are written down to fair market value and a charge is recorded to current operations 

significant and unanticipated changes in circumstances such as significant declines in profitability and cash flow due to significant and longterm deterioration in macroeconomic industry and market conditions the loss of key customers changes in technology or markets andor other events including effects from the sale or disposal of a reporting unit could require a provision for impairment in a future period 

excess and obsolete inventory snapon records allowances for excess and obsolete inventory based on historical and estimated future demand and market conditions allowances for raw materials are largely based on an analysis of raw material age and actual physical inspection of raw material for fitness for use as part of evaluating the adequacy of allowances for workinprogress and finished goods management reviews individual product stockkeeping units skus by product category and product life cycle cost adjustments for each product categoryproduct lifecycle state are generally established and maintained based on a combination of historical experience forecasted sales and promotions technological obsolescence inventory age and other actual known conditions and circumstances should actual product marketability and raw material fitness for use be affected by conditions that are different from management estimates further adjustments to inventory allowances may be required 

pension benefits the pension benefit obligation and related pension expense are calculated in accordance with us gaap and are impacted by certain actuarial assumptions changes in these assumptions are primarily influenced by factors outside of snapon’s control and can have a significant effect on the amounts reported in the financial statements snapon believes that the two most critical assumptions are i the expected return on plan assets and ii the assumed discount rate 

pension expense increases as the expected rate of return on plan assets decreases lowering the expected rate of return assumption for snapon’s domestic pension plan assets by 50 bps would have increased snapon’s 2014 domestic pension expense by approximately 42 million snapon uses a threeyear marketrelated value asset method of amortizing the difference between actual and expected returns on its domestic plans’ assets 

  

 

 

 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued 

 

 

 

  

the objective of snapon’s discount rate assumption is to reflect the rate at which the pension benefits could be effectively settled in making this determination the company takes into account the timing and amount of benefits that would be available under the plans the domestic discount rate as of 2014 and 2013 year end was selected based on a cash flow matching methodology developed by the company’s outside actuaries and which incorporates a review of current economic conditions this methodology matches the plans’ yearly projected benefit cash flows to those of hypothetical bond portfolios using highquality aa rated or better corporate bonds from either moody’s investors service or standard  poor’s credit rating agencies available at the measurement date this technique calculates bond portfolios that produce adequate cash flows to pay the plans’ projected yearly benefits and then selects the portfolio with the highest yield and uses that yield as the recommended discount rate 

the selection of the 42 weightedaverage discount rate for snapon’s domestic pension plans as of 2014 year end represents the single rate that produces the same present value of cash flows as the estimated benefit plan payments lowering snapon’s domestic discount rate assumption by 50 bps would have increased snapon’s 2014 domestic pension expense and projected benefit obligation by approximately 60 million and 634 million respectively as of 2014 year end snapon’s domestic projected benefit obligation comprised approximately 82 of snapon’s worldwide projected benefit obligation the weightedaverage discount rate for snapon’s foreign pension plans of 33 represents the single rate that produces the same present value of cash flows as the estimated benefit plan payments lowering snapon’s foreign discount rate assumption by 50 bps would have increased snapon’s 2014 foreign pension expense and projected benefit obligation by approximately 19 million and 227 million respectively 

actuarial gains and losses in excess of 10 percent of the greater of the projected benefit obligation or marketrelated value of assets are amortized on a straightline basis over the average remaining service period of active participants or over the average remaining life expectancy for plans with primarily inactive participants prior service costs and credits resulting from plan amendments are amortized in equal annual amounts over the average remaining service period of active participants or over the average remaining life expectancy for plans with primarily inactive participants see note 11 to the consolidated financial statements for further information on pension plans 

income taxes snapon records deferred income tax assets and liabilities for differences between the book basis and tax basis of the related net assets snapon records a valuation allowance when appropriate to reduce its deferred tax assets if it is morelikelythannot that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized while the company has considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance if these estimates and assumptions change in the future the company may be required to adjust its valuation allowance this could result in a charge to or an increase in income in the period such determination is made 

in addition the company operates within multiple taxing jurisdictions and is subject to audit in these jurisdictions the company records accruals for the estimated outcomes of these audits and the accruals may change in the future due to new developments in each matter see note 8 to the consolidated financial statements for further information on income taxes 

outlook 

in 2015 snapon expects to make continued progress along its defined runways for coherent growth leveraging capabilities already demonstrated in the automotive repair arena and developing and expanding its professional customer base not only in automotive repair but in adjacent markets additional geographies and other areas including in critical industries where the cost and penalties for failure can be high through continued deployment of its snapon value creation processes snapon also anticipates making further progress in 2015 in the areas of safety quality customer connection innovation and rapid continuous improvement in pursuit of these initiatives snapon expects that capital expenditures in 2015 will be in a range of 80 million to 90 million snapon also anticipates that its full year 2015 effective income tax rate will be at or below its 2014 full year rate 

  

 

 

  

 

  




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

market credit and economic risks 

market risk is the potential economic loss that may result from adverse changes in the fair value of financial instruments snapon is exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates snapon is also exposed to market risk associated with the stockbased portion of its deferred compensation plans snapon monitors its exposure to these risks and attempts to manage the underlying economic exposures through the use of financial instruments such as foreign currency forward contracts interest rate swap agreements treasury lock agreements and prepaid equity forward agreements “equity forwards” snapon does not use derivative instruments for speculative or trading purposes snapon’s broadbased business activities help to reduce the impact that volatility in any particular area or related areas may have on its operating earnings as a whole snapon’s management takes an active role in the risk management process and has developed policies and procedures that require specific administrative and business functions to assist in the identification assessment and control of various risks 

foreign currency risk management 

snapon has significant international operations and is subject to certain risks inherent with foreign operations that include currency fluctuations foreign exchange risk exists to the extent that snapon has payment obligations or receipts denominated in currencies other than the functional currency including intercompany loans denominated in foreign currencies to manage these exposures snapon identifies naturally offsetting positions and then purchases hedging instruments to protect the residual net exposures see note 10 to the consolidated financial statements for information on foreign currency risk management 

interest rate risk management 

snapon aims to control funding costs by managing the exposure created by the differing maturities and interest rate structures of snapon’s borrowings through the use of interest rate swap agreements treasury lock agreements are used from time to time to manage potential changes in interest rates in anticipation of the issuance or sale of certain financial instruments see note 10 to the consolidated financial statements for information on interest rate risk management 

snapon utilizes a valueatrisk “var” model to determine the potential oneday loss in the fair value of its interest rate and foreign exchangesensitive financial instruments from adverse changes in market factors the var model estimates were made assuming normal market conditions and a 95 confidence level snapon’s computations are based on the interrelationships among movements in various currencies and interest rates variancecovariance technique these interrelationships were determined by observing interest rate and foreign currency market changes over the preceding quarter 

the estimated maximum potential oneday loss in fair value calculated using the var model as of 2014 and 2013 year end was 12 million and 10 million respectively on interest ratesensitive financial instruments and 04 million and 05 million respectively on foreign currencysensitive financial instruments the var model is a risk management tool and does not purport to represent actual losses in fair value that will be incurred by snapon nor does it consider the potential effect of favorable changes in market factors 

stockbased deferred compensation risk management 

snapon aims to manage market risk associated with the stockbased portion of its deferred compensation plans through the use of equity forwards equity forwards are used to aid in offsetting the potential marktomarket effect on stockbased deferred compensation from changes in snapon’s stock price since stockbased deferred compensation liabilities increase as the company’s stock price rises and decrease as the company’s stock price declines the equity forwards are intended to mitigate the potential impact on compensation expense that may result from such marktomarket changes see note 10 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on stockbased deferred compensation risk management 

  

 

 

  

 

  

credit risk 

credit risk is the possibility of loss from a customer’s failure to make payments according to contract terms prior to extending credit each customer is evaluated taking into consideration the customer’s financial condition collateral debtservicing ability past payment experience credit bureau information and other financial and qualitative factors that may affect the customer’s ability to repay credit risk is also monitored regularly through the use of internal proprietary custom scoring models used to evaluate each transaction at the time of the application for credit and by periodically updating those credit scores for ongoing monitoring purposes snapon evaluates credit quality through the use of an internal proprietary measuring system that provides a framework to analyze finance and contract receivables on the basis of risk factors of the individual obligor as well as transaction specific risk the finance and contract receivables are typically monitored through an asset quality review process that closely monitors past due accounts and initiates a progressive collection action process when appropriate 

counterparty risk 

snapon is exposed to credit losses in the event of nonperformance by the counterparties to its various financial agreements including its foreign currency forward contracts interest rate swap agreements and prepaid equity forward agreements snapon does not obtain collateral or other security to support financial instruments subject to credit risk but monitors the credit standing of the counterparties and generally enters into agreements with financial institution counterparties with a credit rating of a or better snapon does not anticipate nonperformance by its counterparties but cannot provide assurances 

economic risk 

economic risk is the possibility of loss resulting from economic instability in certain areas of the world snapon continually monitors its exposure in these markets inflation has not had a significant impact on the company 

as a result of the above market credit and economic risks net earnings and revenues in any particular period may not be representative of fullyear results and may vary significantly from year to year 

commodity risk 

snapon is a purchaser of certain commodities such as steel natural gas and electricity the company is also a purchaser of components and parts that are integrated into the company’s end products as well as the purchaser of certain finished goods all of which may contain various commodities including steel aluminum and others snapon’s supply of raw materials and purchased components are generally and readily available from numerous suppliers 

the principal raw material used in the manufacture of the company’s products is steel which the company purchases in competitive pricesensitive markets to meet snapon’s high quality standards the company’s steel needs range from specialized alloys which are available only from a limited group of approved suppliers to commodity types of alloys these raw materials have historically exhibited price and demand cyclicality some of these materials have been and in the future may be in short supply particularly in the event of a general economic recovery mill shutdowns or production cut backs as some steel alloys require specialized manufacturing procedures snapon could experience inventory shortages if it were required to use an alternative manufacturer on short notice additionally unexpected price increases for raw materials could result in higher prices to snapon’s customers or an erosion of the margins on its products 

snapon believes its ability to sell product is also dependent on the number of vehicles on the road the number of miles driven and the general aging of vehicles these factors affect the frequency type and amount of service and repair performed on vehicles by technicians and therefore affect the demand for the number of technicians the prosperity of the technicians and subsequently the demand technicians have for the company’s tools other products and services and the value technicians place on those products and services to the extent that the prices of gasoline and other petroleumbased fuels increase as they have at times in recent years consumers may turn to other methods of transportation including more frequent use of public transportation which could result in a decrease in the use of privately operated vehicles a decrease in the use of privately operated vehicles may lead to fewer repairs and less demand for the company’s products 

to the extent that commodity prices increase and the company does not have firm pricing agreements with its suppliers the company may experience margin declines to the extent that it is not able to increase the selling prices of its products

sales and distribution 

snapon markets and distributes its products and related services principally to professional tool and equipment users around the world the two largest market sectors are the vehicle service and repair sector and the industrial sector 

vehicle service and repair sector 

the vehicle service and repair sector has three main customer groups i professional technicians who purchase tools and diagnostic and equipment products for themselves ii other professional customers related to vehicle repair including owners and managers of independent and oem dealership service and repair shops who purchase tools and diagnostic and equipment products for use by multiple technicians within a service or repair facility and iii oems 

snapon provides innovative tool equipment and business solutions as well as technical sales support and training designed to meet technicians’ evolving needs snapon’s mobile van distribution system offers technicians the convenience of purchasing quality tools at their place of business with minimal disruption of their work routine snapon also provides owners and managers of shops where technicians work with tools diagnostic equipment repair and service information including electronic parts catalogs and shop management products snapon’s oem facilitation business provides oems with products and services including tools consulting and facilitation services which include product procurement distribution and administrative support to customers for their dealership equipment programs 

major challenges in the vehicle service and repair sector include the increasing rate of technological change within motor vehicles vehicle population growth vehicle life and the resulting effects on the businesses of both our suppliers and customers due to these changes snapon believes it is a meaningful participant in the market sector for vehicle service and repair 

industrial sector 

snapon markets its products and services globally to a broad crosssection of commercial and industrial customers including maintenance and repair operations manufacturing and assembly facilities various government agencies facilities and operations including military operations vocational and technical schools aerospace and aviation oem and service and repair customers oil and gas developers mining operations energy and power generation equipment fabricators and operators agriculture infrastructure construction companies and other customers that require instrumentation service tools andor equipment for their product and business needs 

the industrial sector for snapon has focused on providing valueadded products and services to an increasingly expanding global base of customers in critical industries particularly those in the market segments of natural resources aerospace government and technical education through its experienced and dispersed sales organization industrial “solutioneers” develop unique and highly valued productivity solutions for customers worldwide that leverage snapon’s product service and development capabilities 

  

 

 

  

 

  

major challenges in the industrial sector include a highly competitive costconscious environment and a trend toward customers making many of their tool and equipment purchases through one integrated supplier snapon believes it is a meaningful participant in the market sector for industrial tools and equipment 

distribution channels 

snapon serves customers primarily through the following channels of distribution i the mobile van channel ii company direct sales iii distributors and iv ecommerce the following discussion summarizes snapon’s general approach for each channel and is not intended to be allinclusive 

mobile van channel 

in the united states a significant portion of sales to the vehicle service and repair sector is conducted through snapon’s mobile franchise van channel snapon’s franchisees primarily serve vehicle repair technicians and vehicle service shop owners generally providing weekly contact at the customer’s place of business franchisees’ sales are concentrated in hand and power tools tool storage products and shop equipment and diagnostic and repair information products which can easily be transported in a van and demonstrated during a brief sales call franchisees purchase snapon’s products at a discount from suggested list prices and resell them at prices established by the franchisee us franchisees are provided a list of places of business that serves as the basis of the franchisee’s sales route 

snapon also provides certain franchisees the opportunity to add vans to their franchise or to add a limited number of additional franchises snapon charges nominal initial and ongoing monthly franchise fees since 1991 written franchise agreements have been entered into with all new us franchisees and most pre1991 independent franchisees as of 2013 year end there were 3237 vans operated by us franchisees as compared with 3209 vans as of 2012 year end 

snapon previously offered an option termed the “gateway franchise program” to certain potential us franchisees including those that did not meet the standard franchise qualification requirements gateway franchise program participants had less upfront investment and were provided an initial base level of consigned inventory from snapon to assist them in gaining experience and building equity toward the future purchase of a standard franchise snapon ceased offering new gateway franchises in february 2013 all current gateway franchises will either convert to a standard franchise or terminate their franchise by the end of february 2015 as of 2013 year end approximately 80 of snapon’s vans operated by us franchisees were gateway franchise program franchisees 

in addition to its mobile van channel in the united states snapon has replicated its us franchise van distribution model in certain other countries including australia canada germany japan the united kingdom the netherlands south africa new zealand belgium and ireland in many of these markets as in the united states purchase decisions are generally made or influenced by professional vehicle service technicians as well as repair shop owners and managers as of 2013 year end snapon’s worldwide mobile van count was approximately 4800 including approximately 3500 vans in the united states 

through soc financing is available to us franchisees including financing for van and truck leases working capital loans and loans to help enable new franchisees to fund the purchase of the franchise in many international markets snapon offers a variety of financing options to its franchisees andor customer networks through its international finance subsidiaries the decision to finance through snapon or another financing entity is solely at the customer’s election 

snapon supports its franchisees with a field organization of regional offices franchise performance teams diagnostic sales developers “dsds” customer care centers and distribution centers snapon also provides sales and business training and marketing and product promotion programs as well as customer and franchisee financing programs through soc and the company’s international finance subsidiaries all of which are designed to strengthen franchisee sales in north america the united states national franchise advisory council and the canadian national franchise advisory council both of which are composed primarily of franchisees that are elected by franchisees assist snapon in identifying and implementing enhancements to the franchise program 

  

 

 

  

 

  

in the united states franchisees work closely with dsds dsds train franchisees on the sale of higherpricepoint diagnostics and demonstrate and sell vehicle service shop management and information systems dsds work independently and with franchisees to identify and generate sales among vehicle service technicians and repair shop owners and managers dsds are snapon employees who are compensated through a combination of base salary and commission a franchisee receives a brokerage fee from certain sales made by the dsds to the franchisee’s customers most products sold through franchisees and dsds are sold under the snapon bluepoint and shopkey brand names 

snapon also has a companyowned van program in the united states that is designed to i provide another pool of potential franchisees and field organization personnel ii service customers in select new andor open routes not currently serviced by franchisees and iii allow snapon to pilot new sales and promotional ideas prior to introducing them to franchisees as of 2013 year end companyowned vans comprised approximately 5 of the total us van population snapon may elect to increase or reduce the number of companyowned vans in the future 

company direct sales 

a significant proportion of shop equipment sales in north america under the john bean hofmann blackhawk and challenger brands diagnostic products under the snapon brand and information products under the mitchell1 brand are made by direct and independent sales forces that have responsibility for national and other accounts as the vehicle service and repair sector consolidates with more business conducted by national chains and franchised service centers snapon believes these larger organizations can be serviced most effectively by sales people who can demonstrate and sell the full line of diagnostic and equipment products and services snapon also sells these products and services directly to oems and their franchised dealers 

snapon brand tools and equipment are marketed to industrial and governmental customers in the united states through both industrial sales representatives who are employees and independent industrial distributors outside of the united states industrial sales are also conducted through other independent distributors sales representatives focus on industrial customers whose main purchase criteria are quality and service as of 2013 year end snapon had industrial sales representatives in the united states including puerto rico australia canada japan mexico and various european asian latin american and middle eastern countries with the united states representing the majority of snapon’s total industrial sales 

snapon also sells software services and solutions to the automotive power equipment and power sports segments products and services are marketed to targeted groups including oems and their dealerships and individual repair shops to effectively reach oems such as general motors company daimler ag ford motor company chrysler group llc toyota motor corporation john deere deere  company cnh industrial nv jc bamford excavators ltd jcb and yamaha corporation snapon has deployed focused business teams globally 

distributors 

sales of certain tools and equipment are made through independent distributors who purchase the items from snapon and resell them to end users hand tools under the bahco fish and hook lindström and williams brands and trade names for example are sold through distributors in europe north and south america asia and certain other parts of the world wheel service and other vehicle service equipment are sold through distributors primarily under brands including hofmann john bean challenger cartec and blackhawk diagnostic and equipment products are marketed through distributors in south america and asia and through both a direct sales force and distributors in europe under the snapon sun bahco and bluepoint brands 

ecommerce 

snapon’s ecommerce development initiatives allow snapon to combine the capabilities of the internet with snapon’s existing brand sales and distribution strengths to reach new and underserved customer segments snapon offers current and prospective customers online aroundtheclock access to research and purchase products through its public internet website at wwwsnaponcom  the site features an online catalog of snapon hand tools power tools tool storage units and diagnostic equipment available to customers in the united states the united kingdom canada and australia ecommerce and certain other system enhancement initiatives are designed to improve productivity and further leverage the oneonone relationships and service snapon has with its current and prospective customers sales through the company’s ecommerce distribution channel were not significant in any of the last three years 

  

 

 

  

 

  

competition 

snapon competes on the basis of its product quality and performance product line breadth and depth service brand awareness and imagery technological innovation and availability of financing through soc or its international finance subsidiaries while snapon does not believe that any single company competes with it across all of its product lines and distribution channels various companies compete in one or more product categories andor distribution channels 

snapon believes it is a leading manufacturer and distributor of professional tools tool storage diagnostic and equipment products and repair software and solutions offering a broad line of these products to both vehicle service and industrial marketplaces various competitors target and sell to professional technicians in the vehicle service and repair sector through the mobile van channel snapon also competes with companies that sell tools and equipment to vehicle service and repair technicians through retail stores and online vehicle parts supply outlets and tool supply warehousesdistributorships within the power tools category and the industrial sector snapon has various other competitors including companies with offerings that overlap with other areas discussed herein major competitors selling diagnostics shop equipment and information to vehicle dealerships and independent repair shops include oems and their proprietary electronic parts catalogs diagnostics and information systems as well as other companies that offer products serving this sector 

raw materials and purchased product 

snapon’s supply of raw materials and purchased components are generally and readily available from numerous suppliers snapon believes it has secured an ample supply of both bar and coil steel for the near future to ensure stable supply to meet material demands the company does not currently anticipate experiencing any significant impact in 2014 from steel pricing or availability issues 

patents trademarks and other intellectual property 

snapon vigorously pursues and relies on patent protection to protect its intellectual property and position in its markets as of 2013 year end snapon and its subsidiaries held over 700 active and pending patents in the united states and approximately 1500 active and pending patents outside of the united states sales relating to any single patent did not represent a material portion of snapon’s revenues in any of the last three years 

examples of products that have features or designs that benefit from patent protection include wheel alignment systems wheel balancers tire changers vehicle lifts test lanes sealed ratchets electronic torque instruments ratcheting screwdrivers emissionssensing devices and diagnostic equipment 

much of the technology used in the manufacture of vehicle service tools and equipment is in the public domain snapon relies primarily on trade secret protection to protect proprietary processes used in manufacturing methods and processes are patented when appropriate copyright protection is also utilized when appropriate 

trademarks used by snapon are of continuing importance to snapon in the marketplace trademarks have been registered in the united states and more than 120 other countries and additional applications for trademark registrations are pending snapon vigorously polices proper use of its trademarks snapon’s right to manufacture and sell certain products is dependent upon licenses from others however these products under license do not represent a material portion of snapon’s net sales 

domain names have become a valuable corporate asset for companies around the world including snapon domain names often contain a trademark or service mark or even a corporate name and are often considered intellectual property the recognition and value of the snapon name trademark and domain name are core strengths of the company 

  

 

 

  

 

  

snapon strategically licenses the snapon brand to carefully selected manufacturing and distribution companies for items such as apparel work boots lighting and a variety of other goods in order to further build equity and market presence for the company’s strongest brand 

environmental 

snapon is subject to various environmental laws ordinances regulations and other requirements of government authorities in the united states and other nations at snapon these environmental liabilities are managed through the snapon environmental health and safety management system “eh  sms” which is applied worldwide the system is based upon continual improvement and is certified to iso 140012004 and ohsas 180012007 verified through det norske veritas dnv certification inc 

snapon believes that it complies with applicable environmental control requirements in its operations expenditures on environmental matters through eh  sms have not had and snapon does not for the foreseeable future expect them to have a material effect upon snapon’s capital expenditures earnings or competitive position 

employees 

snapon employed approximately 11300 people at the end of january 2014 snapon employed approximately 11200 people at the end of january 2013 

approximately 2600 employees or 23 of snapon’s worldwide workforce are represented by unions andor covered under collective bargaining agreements the number of covered union employees whose contracts expire within the next five years approximates 1200 employees in 2014 and 1050 employees in 2015 there are no contracts currently scheduled to expire in 2016 2017 or 2018 in recent years snapon has not experienced any significant work slowdowns stoppages or other labor disruptions 

there can be no assurance that these and other future contracts with snapon’s unions will be renegotiated upon terms acceptable to snapon 

working capital 

most of snapon’s businesses are not seasonal and their inventory needs are relatively constant snapon did not have a significant backlog of orders at 2013 year end in recent years snapon has been using its working capital to fund in part the continued growth of the company’s financial services portfolio 

snapon’s liquidity and capital resources and use of working capital are discussed herein in “part ii item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” 

as of 2013 year end neither snapon nor any of its segments depend on any single customer small group of customers or government for any material part of its revenues 




 item 1a risk factors 

in evaluating the company careful consideration should be given to the following risk factors in addition to the other information included in this annual report on form 10k including the consolidated financial statements and the related notes each of these risk factors could adversely affect the company’s business operating results cash flows andor financial condition as well as adversely affect the value of an investment in the company’s common stock 

  

 

 

  

 

  

economic conditions and world events could affect our operating results 

we our franchisees and our customers may be adversely affected by changing economic conditions including conditions that may particularly impact specific regions these conditions may result in reduced consumer and investor confidence instability in the credit and financial markets volatile corporate profits and reduced business and consumer spending we our franchisees and our customers and the economy as a whole also may be affected by future world or local events outside our control such as acts of terrorism developments in the war on terrorism conflicts in international situations and natural disasters as well as governmentrelated developments or issues these factors may affect our results of operations by reducing our sales margins andor net income as a result of a slowdown in customer orders or order cancellations impact the availability of raw materials andor the supply chain and could potentially lead to future impairment of our intangible assets in addition political and social turmoil related to international conflicts and terrorist acts may put pressure on economic conditions abroad unstable political social and economic conditions may make it difficult for our franchisees customers suppliers and us to accurately forecast and plan future business activities if such conditions persist our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows could be negatively affected 

raw material and energy price fluctuations and shortages including steel and various fuel sources could adversely affect the ability to obtain needed manufacturing materials and could adversely affect our results of operations 

the principal raw material used in the manufacture of our products is steel which we purchase in competitive pricesensitive markets to meet snapon’s high quality standards our steel needs range from specialized alloys which are available only from a limited group of approved suppliers to commodity types of alloys these raw materials have historically exhibited price and demand cyclicality some of these materials have been and in the future may be in short supply particularly in the event of a general economic recovery mill shut downs or production cut backs as some steel alloys require specialized manufacturing procedures we could experience inventory shortages if we were required to use an alternative manufacturer on short notice additionally unexpected price increases for raw materials could result in higher prices to our customers or an erosion of the margins on our products 

we believe our ability to sell our products is also dependent on the number of vehicles on the road the number of miles driven and the general aging of vehicles these factors affect the frequency type and amount of service and repair performed on vehicles by technicians and therefore affect the demand for the number of technicians the prosperity of the technicians and subsequently the demand technicians have for our tools other products and services and the value technicians place on those products and services to the extent that the prices of gasoline and other petroleumbased fuels increase as they have at times in recent years consumers may turn to other methods of transportation including more frequent use of public transportation which could result in a decrease in the use of privately operated vehicles a decrease in the use of privately operated vehicles may lead to fewer repairs and less demand for our products 

we use various energy sources to transport produce and distribute products and some of our products have components that are petroleum based petroleum and energy prices have periodically increased significantly over short periods of time further volatility and changes may be caused by market fluctuations supply and demand currency fluctuation production and transportation disruption world events and changes in governmental programs energy price increases raise both our operating costs and the costs of our materials and we may not be able to increase our prices enough to offset these costs higher prices also may reduce the level of future customer orders and our profitability 

the performance of snapon’s mobile van tool distribution business depends on the success of its franchisees 

approximately 42 of our 2013 revenues were generated by the snapon tools group which consists of snapon’s business operations serving the worldwide van channel except in limited circumstances each of our mobile tool vans is operated by a franchisee pursuant to a franchise agreement snapon’s success is dependent on its relationships with franchisees individually and collectively as they are the primary sales and service link between the company and vehicle service and repair technicians who are an important class of end users for snapon’s products and services if our franchisees are not successful or if we do not maintain an effective relationship with our franchisees the delivery of products the collection of receivables andor our relationship with end users could be adversely affected and thereby negatively impact our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

  

 

 

  

 

  

in addition if we are unable to maintain effective relationships with franchisees snapon or the franchisees may choose to terminate the relationship which may result in i open routes in which enduser customers are not provided reliable service ii litigation resulting from termination iii reduced collections or increased writeoffs of franchisee receivables owed to snapon andor iv reduced collections or increased writeoffs of extended credit contracts and to a lesser extent lease contracts that are collected by franchisees on behalf of soc 

new and stricter legislation and regulations may affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

increased legislative and regulatory activity and burdens and a more stringent manner in which they are applied particularly in the united states could significantly impact our business and the economy as a whole for example the affordable care act the “aca” which was adopted in 2010 and is being phased in over several years significantly affects the provision of both health care services and benefits in the united states the aca may impact our cost of providing our employees and retirees with health insurance andor benefits and may also impact various other aspects of our business the aca did not have a material impact on our fiscal 2013 2012 or 2011 financial results however we are continuing to assess the impact of the aca on our health care benefit costs also the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act of 2010 the “doddfrank act” may affect among other matters the costs related to corporate governance sourcing compliance disclosures and general securities law compliance the doddfrank act did not have a material impact on our fiscal 2013 2012 or 2011 financial results 

financial services businesses of all kinds are subject to increasing regulation and enforcement including as a result of the doddfrank act in addition to potentially increasing the costs of doing business due to compliance obligations new laws and regulations or changes to existing laws and regulations as well as the enforcement thereof may affect the relationships between creditors and debtors inhibit the rights of creditors to collect amounts owed to them expand liability for certain actions or inactions or limit the types of financial products or services offered any or all of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows failure to comply with any of these laws or regulations could also result in penalties and damage to our reputation andor the incurrence of remediation costs 

these developments and other potential future legislation and regulations as well as the increasingly strict regulatory environment may also adversely affect the customers to which and the markets into which we sell our products and increase our costs and otherwise negatively affect our business reputation financial condition or results of operations including in ways that cannot yet be foreseen 

exposure to credit risks of customers and resellers may make it difficult to collect receivables and could adversely affect operating results and financial condition 

industry and economic conditions have the potential to weaken the financial position of some of our customers if circumstances surrounding our customers’ ability to repay their credit obligations were to deteriorate and result in the writedown or writeoff of such receivables it would negatively affect our operating results for the period in which they occur and if large could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

uncertainty and adverse developments in the credit and financial markets could negatively impact the availability of credit that we and our customers need to operate our businesses 

we depend upon the availability of credit to operate our business including the financing of receivables from enduser customers that are originated by our financial services businesses our enduser customers franchisees and suppliers also require access to credit for their businesses at times in recent years world financial markets have been unstable and subject to uncertainty uncertainty and adverse developments in the credit and financial markets or adverse changes in snapon’s credit rating could negatively impact the availability of future financing and the terms on which it might be available to snapon its enduser customers franchisees and suppliers inability to access credit or capital markets or a deterioration in the terms on which financing might be available could have an adverse impact on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

  

 

 

  

 

  

increasing our financial leverage could affect our operations and profitability 

in fiscal 2013 we increased the maximum available credit under our multicurrency revolving credit facility from 500 million to 700 million also in fiscal 2013 our former 364day loan and servicing agreement which allowed us to borrow up to 200 million through the pledging of finance receivables under an assetbacked commercial paper conduit facility expired at the end of its term on september 27 2013 and was not renewed the company’s leverage ratio may affect both our availability of additional capital resources as well as our operations in several ways including 

 

     while we believe we will have the ability to service our debt and obtain additional resources in the future if and when needed that will depend upon our results of operations and financial position at the time the thencurrent state of the credit and financial markets and other factors that may be beyond our control therefore we cannot give assurances that credit will be available on terms that we consider attractive or at all if and when necessary or beneficial to us 

our inability to provide acceptable financing alternatives to enduser customers and franchisees could adversely impact our operating results 

an integral component of our business and profitability is our ability to offer competitive financing alternatives to enduser customers and franchisees the lack of our ability to obtain capital resources or other financing to support our receivables on terms that we believe are attractive whether resulting from the state of the financial markets our own operating performance or other factors would negatively affect our operating results and financial condition adverse fluctuations in interest rates andor our ability to provide competitive financing programs could also have an adverse impact on our revenue and profitability 

failure to achieve expected investment returns on pension plan assets as well as changes in interest rates could adversely impact our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

snapon sponsors various defined benefit pension plans the “pension plans” the assets of the pension plans are broadly diversified in an attempt to mitigate the risk of a large loss the assets are invested in equity securities debt securities hedge funds real estate and other real assets insurance contracts and cash and cash equivalents required funding for the company’s domestic defined benefit pension plans is determined in accordance with guidelines set forth in the federal employee retirement income security act erisa foreign defined benefit pension plans are funded in accordance with local statutes or practice additional contributions to enhance the funded status of the pension plans can be made at the company’s discretion however there can be no assurance that the value of the pension plan assets or the investment returns on those plan assets will be sufficient to meet the future benefit obligations of such plans in addition during periods of adverse investment market conditions and declining interest rates the company may be required to make additional cash contributions to the pension plans that could reduce our financial flexibility 

our pension plan obligations are affected by changes in market interest rates significant fluctuations in market interest rates have added and may further add volatility to our pension plan obligations in periods of declining market interest rates our pension plan obligations generally increase in periods of increasing market interest rates our pension plan obligations generally decrease while our plan assets are broadly diversified there are inherent market risks associated with investments if adverse market conditions occur our plan assets could incur significant or material losses since we may need to make additional contributions to address changes in obligations andor a loss in plan assets the combination of declining market interest rates andor past or future plan asset investment losses could adversely impact our financial position results of operations and cash flows 

  

 

 

  

 

  

the company’s pension plan expense is comprised of the following factors i service cost ii interest on projected benefit obligations iii the expected return on plan assets iv the amortization of prior service costs and credits v the effects of actuarial gains and losses and vi settlementcurtailment costs when applicable the accounting for pensions involves the estimation of a number of factors that are highly uncertain certain factors such as the interest on projected benefit obligations and the expected return on pension plan assets are impacted by changes in market interest rates and the value of plan assets a significant decrease in market interest rates and a decrease in the fair value of pension plan assets would increase net pension expense and may adversely affect the company’s future results of operations see note 11 to the consolidated financial statements for further information on the company’s pension plans 

the steps taken to restructure operations rationalize operating footprint lower operating expenses and achieve greater efficiencies in the supply chain could disrupt business 

we have taken steps in the past and expect to take additional steps in the future intended to improve customer service and drive further efficiencies and reduce costs some of which could be disruptive to our business these actions collectively across our operating groups are focused on the following 

 

       we believe that by executing on these focus areas and continuing our commitment to new innovative products and efficiency and productivity initiatives to drive higher levels of productivity and lower costs the company and its franchisees may realize stronger growth and profitability however failure to succeed in the implementation of any or all of these actions could result in an inability to achieve our financial goals and could be disruptive to the business 

in addition any future reductions to headcount and other cost reduction measures may result in the loss of technical expertise that could adversely affect our research and development efforts as well as our ability to meet product development schedules efforts to reduce components of expense could result in the recording of charges for inventory and technologyrelated writeoffs workforce reduction costs or other charges relating to the consolidation or closure of facilities if we were to incur a substantial charge to further these efforts our earnings per share would be adversely affected in such period if we are unable to effectively manage our cost reduction and restructuring efforts our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows could be negatively affected 

failure to maintain effective distribution of products and services could adversely impact revenue gross margin and profitability 

we use a variety of distribution methods to sell our products and services successfully managing the interaction of our distribution efforts to reach various potential customer segments for our products and services is a complex process moreover since each distribution method has distinct risks costs and gross margins our failure to implement the most advantageous balance in the delivery model for our products and services could adversely affect our revenue and gross margins and therefore our profitability 

risks associated with the disruption of manufacturing operations could adversely affect profitability or competitive position 

we manufacture a significant portion of the products we sell any prolonged disruption in the operations of our existing manufacturing facilities whether due to technical or labor difficulties facility consolidation or closure actions lack of raw material or component availability destruction of or damage to any facility as a result of natural disasters use and storage of hazardous materials or other events or other reasons could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

  

 

 

  

 

  

the inability to continue to introduce new products that respond to customer needs and achieve market acceptance could result in lower revenues and reduced profitability 

sales from new products represent a significant portion of our net sales and are expected to continue to represent a significant component of our future net sales we may not be able to compete effectively unless we continue to enhance existing products or introduce new products to the marketplace in a timely manner product improvements and new product introductions require significant financial and other resources including significant planning design development and testing at the technological product and manufacturing process levels our competitors’ new products may beat our products to market be more effective with more features be less expensive than our products andor render our products obsolete any new products that we develop may not receive market acceptance or otherwise generate any meaningful net sales or profits for us relative to our expectations based on among other things existing and anticipated investments in manufacturing capacity and commitments to fund advertising marketing promotional programs and research and development 

the global tool equipment and diagnostics and repair information industries are competitive 

we face strong competition in all of our market segments price competition in our various industries is intense and pricing pressures from competitors and customers are increasing in general as a manufacturer and marketer of premium products and services the expectations of snapon’s customers and its franchisees are high and increasing any inability to maintain customer satisfaction could diminish snapon’s premium image and reputation and could result in a lessening of our ability to command premium pricing we expect that the level of competition will remain high in the future which could limit our ability to maintain or increase market share or profitability 

product liability claims and litigation could affect our business reputation financial condition results of operations and cash flows

as of 2013 year end working capital current assets less current liabilities of 10808 million increased 10 million from 10798 million as of 2012 year end

 cash and cash equivalents of 2176 million as of 2013 year end compared to cash and cash equivalents of 2145 million at 2012 year end the 31 million net increase in cash and cash equivalents includes the impacts of i 5088 million of cash from collections of finance receivables ii 3926 million of cash generated from operations net of 243 million of discretionary cash contributions to the company’s pension plans iii 292 million of cash proceeds from stock purchase and option plan exercises and iv 84 million of cash proceeds from the sale of property and equipment these increases in cash and cash equivalents were largely offset by i the funding of 6513 million of new finance receivables ii dividend payments to shareholders of 920 million iii the repurchase of 926000 shares of the company’s common stock for 826 million iv the funding of 706 million of capital expenditures and v the may 2013 acquisition of challenger for a cash purchase price of 382 million 

of the 2176 million of cash and cash equivalents as of 2013 year end 1243 million was held outside of the united states snapon considers these nonus funds as permanently invested in its foreign operations to i provide adequate working capital ii satisfy various regulatory requirements andor iii take advantage of business expansion opportunities as they arise as such the company does not presently expect to repatriate these funds to fund its us operations or obligations the repatriation of cash from certain foreign subsidiaries could have adverse net tax consequences on the company should snapon be required to pay and record us income taxes and foreign withholding taxes on funds that were previously considered permanently invested alternatively the repatriation of such cash from certain other foreign subsidiaries could result in favorable net tax consequences for the company snapon periodically evaluates opportunities to repatriate certain foreign cash amounts to the extent that it does not incur additional unfavorable net tax consequences

snapon’s previous 364day loan and servicing agreement which allowed snapon to borrow up to 200 million subject to borrowing base requirements through the pledging of finance receivables under an assetbacked commercial paper conduit facility expired at the end of its term on september 27 2013 and was not renewed at the time of its expiration no amounts were outstanding under the loan and servicing agreement 

snapon’s credit facility and other debt agreements also contain certain usual and customary borrowing affirmative negative and maintenance covenants as of 2013 year end snapon was in compliance with all covenants of its credit facility and debt agreements 

snapon believes that it has sufficient available cash and access to both committed and uncommitted credit facilities to cover its expected funding needs on both a shortterm and longterm basis including the scheduled 100 million repayment of the 2014 notes upon maturity snapon manages its aggregate shortterm borrowings so as not to exceed its availability under its revolving credit facility if the need were to arise snapon believes that it could access shortterm debt markets predominantly through commercial paper issuances and existing lines of credit to fund its shortterm requirements and to ensure nearterm liquidity snapon regularly monitors the credit and financial markets and in the future may take advantage of what it believes are favorable market conditions to issue longterm debt to further improve its liquidity and capital resources near term liquidity requirements for snapon include scheduled debt repayments including the march 2014 repayment of the 2014 notes payments of interest and dividends funding to support new receivables originated by our financial services businesses capital expenditures working capital restructuring activities the funding of pension plans and funding for additional share repurchases and acquisitions if any snapon intends to make contributions of 110 million to its foreign pension plans and 18 million to its domestic pension plans in 2014 as required by law depending on market and other conditions snapon may elect to make discretionary cash contributions to its pension plans in 2014

offbalancesheet arrangements 

except as included below in the section labeled “contractual obligations and commitments” and note 15 to the consolidated financial statements the company had no offbalancesheet arrangements as of 2013 year end

 snapon intends to make contributions of 110 million to its foreign pension plans and 18 million to its domestic pension plans in 2014 as required by law depending on market and other conditions snapon may elect to make discretionary cash contributions to its pension plans in 2014 snapon has not presented estimated pension and postretirement funding contributions in the table above as the funding can vary from year to year based upon changes in the fair value of the plan assets and actuarial assumptions see notes 11 and 12 to the consolidated financial statements for information on the companys benefit plans and payments 

due to the uncertainty of the timing of settlements with taxing authorities snapon is unable to make reasonably reliable estimates of the period of cash settlement of unrecognized tax benefits for its remaining uncertain tax liabilities as a result 46 million of unrecognized tax benefits have been excluded from the table above see note 8 to the consolidated financial statements for information on income taxes

new accounting standards 

see note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for information on new accounting standards 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the consolidated financial statements and related notes contain information that is pertinent to management’s discussion and analysis the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america “us gaap” requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period these estimates are generally based on historical experience current conditions and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily available from other sources as well as identifying and assessing our accounting treatment with respect to commitments and contingencies actual results could differ from those estimates 

the company’s significant accounting policies are described in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements 

snapon considers the following policies and estimates to be the most critical in understanding the judgments that are involved in the preparation of the company’s consolidated financial statements and the uncertainties that could impact the company’s financial position results of operations and cash flows 

revenue recognition snapon recognizes revenue from the sale of tools and diagnostic and equipment products when contract terms are met the price is fixed or determinable collectability is reasonably assured and a product is shipped or risk of ownership has been transferred to and accepted by the customer for sales contingent upon customer acceptance revenue recognition is deferred until such obligations are fulfilled estimated product returns are recorded as a reduction in reported revenues at the time of sale based upon historical product return experience and gross profit margin adjusted for known trends provisions for customer volume rebates discounts and allowances are also recorded as a reduction of reported revenues at the time of sale based on historical experience and known trends revenue related to maintenance and subscription agreements is recognized over the terms of the respective agreements 

snapon also recognizes revenue related to multiple element arrangements including sales of hardware software and softwarerelated services when a sales arrangement contains multiple elements such as hardware and software products andor services snapon uses the relative selling price method to allocate revenues between hardware and software elements for software elements that are not essential to the hardware’s functionality and related software postcontract customer support vendor specific objective evidence “vsoe” of fair value is used to further allocate revenue to each element based on its relative fair value and when necessary the residual method is used to assign value to the delivered elements when vsoe only exists for the undelivered elements the amount assigned to the products or services is recognized when the product is delivered andor when the services are performed in instances where the product andor services are performed over an extended period as is the case with subscription agreements or the providing of ongoing support revenue is generally recognized on a straightline basis over the term of the agreement which generally ranges from 12 to 60 months 

franchise fee revenue franchise fee revenue including nominal nonrefundable initial fees is recognized upon the granting of a franchise which is when the company has performed substantially all initial services required by the franchise agreement franchise fee revenue also includes ongoing monthly fees primarily for sales and business training as well as marketing and product promotion programs that are recognized as the fees are earned franchise fee revenue totaled 119 million 99 million and 88 million in fiscal 2013 2012 and 2011 respectively 

financial services revenue snapon also generates revenue from various financing programs that include i installment sales and lease contracts arising from franchisees’ customers and snapon’s industrial and other customers for the purchase or lease of tools and diagnostic and equipment products on an extendedterm payment plan and ii business loans and vehicle leases to franchisees these financing programs are offered through snapon’s finance subsidiaries financial services revenue consists primarily of interest income on finance and contract receivables and is recognized over the life of the contracts with interest computed on the average daily balances of the underlying contracts 

  

 

 

 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued 

 

 

 

  

the decision to finance through snapon or another financing entity is solely at the election of the customer when assessing customers for potential financing snapon considers various factors regarding ability to pay including customers’ financial condition collateral debtservicing ability past payment experience and credit bureau information for finance and contract receivables snapon assesses these factors through the use of credit quality indicators consisting primarily of customer credit risk scores combined with internal credit risk grades collection experience and other internal metrics 

financial services lease arrangements snapon accounts for its financial services leases as direct financing or salestype leases the company determines the gross investment in the lease as the present value of the minimum lease payments using the interest rate implicit in the lease net of amounts if any included therein for executor costs to be paid by snapon together with any profit thereon the difference between the gross investment in the lease and the cost of the leased property is reported as unearned finance charges unearned finance charges are amortized to income over the life of the contract the default covenants included in the lease arrangements are usual and customary consistent with industry practice and do not impact the lease classification except in circumstances where the company has concluded that a lessee’s financial condition has deteriorated the other default covenants under snapon’s lease arrangements are objectively determinable 

impairment of goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets  goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets are tested for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the assets might be impaired annual impairment tests are performed by the company in the second quarter of each year 

snapon evaluates the recoverability of goodwill by estimating the future discounted cash flows of the businesses to which the goodwill relates estimated cash flows and related goodwill are grouped at the reporting unit level the company has determined that its reporting units for testing goodwill impairment are its operating segments or components of an operating segment that constitute a business for which discrete financial information is available and for which segment management regularly reviews the operating results within its four reportable operating segments the company has identified 11 reporting units 

snapon evaluates the recoverability of goodwill by utilizing an income approach that estimates the fair value of the future discounted cash flows of the reporting units to which the goodwill relates the future projections which are based on both past performance and the projections and assumptions used in the company’s operating plans are subject to change as a result of changing economic and competitive conditions this approach reflects management’s internal outlook at the reporting units which management believes provides the best determination of value due to management’s insight and experience with the reporting unit significant estimates used by management in the discounted cash flows methodology include estimates of future cash flows based on expected growth rates price increases working capital levels expected benefits from rci initiatives and a weightedaverage cost of capital that reflects the specific risk profile of the reporting unit being tested the company’s methodologies for valuing goodwill are applied consistently on a yearoveryear basis the assumptions used in performing the second quarter 2013 impairment calculations were evaluated in light of thencurrent market and business conditions snapon continues to believe that the future discounted cash flow valuation model provides the most reasonable and meaningful fair value estimate based upon the reporting units’ projections of future operating results and cash flows and replicates how market participants would value the company’s reporting units in an orderly transaction 

in the event the fair value of a reporting unit is less than the carrying value including goodwill the company would then perform an additional assessment that would compare the implied fair value of goodwill with the carrying amount of goodwill the determination of implied fair value of goodwill would require management to compare the estimated fair value of the reporting unit to the estimated fair value of the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit if necessary the company may consult with valuation specialists to assist with the assessment of the estimated fair value of the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit if the implied fair value of the goodwill is less than the carrying value an impairment loss would be recorded 

  

 

 

  

 

  

snapon also evaluates the recoverability of its indefinitelived trademarks by utilizing an income approach that estimates the fair value of the future discounted cash flows of each of its trademarks the future projections which are based on both past performance and the projections and assumptions used in the company’s operating plans are subject to change as a result of changing economic and competitive conditions significant estimates used by management in the discounted cash flows methodology include estimates of future cash flows based on expected growth and royalty rates expected synergies and a weightedaverage cost of capital that reflects the specific risk profile of the trademark being tested the company’s methodologies for valuing trademarks are applied consistently on a yearoveryear basis the assumptions used in performing the second quarter 2013 impairment calculations were evaluated in light of thencurrent market and business conditions snapon continues to believe that the future discounted cash flow valuation model provides the most reasonable and meaningful fair value estimate based upon the trademarks’ projected future cash flows and replicates how market participants would value the company’s trademarks in an orderly transaction 

inherent in fair value determinations are significant judgments and estimates including material assumptions about future revenue profitability and cash flows the company’s operational plans and its interpretation of current economic indicators should the operations of the businesses with which goodwill or other indefinitelived intangible assets are associated incur significant declines in profitability and cash flow due to significant and longterm deterioration in macroeconomic industry and market conditions including in europe the loss of key customers changes in technology or markets significant changes in key personnel or litigation a significant and sustained decrease in share price andor other events including effects from the sale or disposal of a reporting unit some or all of the recorded goodwill or other indefinitelived intangible assets could be subject to impairment and could result in a material adverse effect on snapon’s financial position or results of operations 

snapon completed its annual impairment testing of goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets in the second quarter of 2013 the results of which did not result in any impairment as of 2013 year end the company has no accumulated impairment losses although the company consistently uses the same methods in developing the assumptions and estimates underlying the fair value calculations such estimates are uncertain by nature and can vary from actual results in performing its annual impairment testing the company performed a sensitivity analysis on the material assumptions used in the discounted cash flow valuation models for each of its 11 reporting units based on the company’s second quarter 2013 impairment testing and assuming a hypothetical 10 decrease in the estimated fair values of each of its 11 reporting units the hypothetical fair value of each of the company’s 11 reporting units would have been greater than its carrying value see note 6 to the consolidated financial statements for further information about goodwill and other intangible assets 

impairment of longlived and amortized intangible assets snapon performs impairment evaluations of its longlived assets including property plant and equipment and intangible assets with finite lives whenever business conditions or events indicate that those assets may be impaired when the estimated future undiscounted cash flows to be generated by the assets are less than the carrying value of the longlived assets the assets are written down to fair market value and a charge is recorded to current operations 

significant and unanticipated changes in circumstances such as significant declines in profitability and cash flow due to significant and longterm deterioration in macroeconomic industry and market conditions including in europe the loss of key customers changes in technology or markets andor other events including effects from the sale or disposal of a reporting unit could require a provision for impairment in a future period 

allowances for doubtful accounts snapon maintains allowances for doubtful accounts to absorb probable losses inherent in its portfolio of receivables the allowances for doubtful accounts represent management’s estimate of the losses inherent in the company’s receivables portfolio based on ongoing assessments and evaluations of collectability and historical loss experience in estimating losses inherent in each of its receivable portfolios trade finance and contract receivables snapon uses historical loss experience rates by portfolio and applies them to a related aging analysis determination of the proper level of allowances by portfolio requires management to exercise significant judgment about the timing frequency and severity of credit losses that could materially affect the provision for credit losses and therefore net income the allowances for doubtful accounts takes into consideration numerous quantitative and qualitative factors by receivable type including historical loss experience collection experience delinquency trends economic conditions and credit risk quality as follows 

 

   

 

 

 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued 

 

 

 

  

  

  

 management performs detailed reviews of its receivables on a monthly andor quarterly basis to assess the adequacy of the allowances based on historical and current trends and other factors affecting credit losses and to determine if any impairment has occurred a receivable is impaired when it is probable that all amounts related to the receivable will not be collected according to the contractual terms of the agreement additions to the allowances for doubtful accounts are maintained through adjustments to the provision for credit losses which are charged to current period earnings amounts determined to be uncollectable are charged directly against the allowances while amounts recovered on previously chargedoff accounts increase the allowances net chargeoffs include the principal amount of losses chargedoff as well as chargedoff interest and fees recovered interest and fees previously chargedoff are recorded through the allowances for doubtful accounts and increase the allowances finance receivables are assessed for chargeoff when an account becomes 120 days past due and are chargedoff typically within 60 days of asset repossession contract receivables related to equipment leases are generally chargedoff when an account becomes 150 days past due while contract receivables related to franchise finance and van leases are generally chargedoff up to 180 days past the asset return date for finance and contract receivables customer bankruptcies are generally chargedoff upon notification that the associated debt is not being reaffirmed or in any event no later than 180 days past due 

snapon does not believe that its trade accounts finance or contract receivables represent significant concentrations of credit risk because of the diversified portfolio of individual customers and geographical areas see note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for further information on receivables and allowances for doubtful accounts 

excess and obsolete inventory  snapon records allowances for excess and obsolete inventory based on historical and estimated future demand and market conditions allowances for raw materials are largely based on an analysis of raw material age and actual physical inspection of raw material for fitness for use as part of evaluating the adequacy of allowances for workinprogress and finished goods management reviews individual product stockkeeping units skus by product category and product life cycle cost adjustments for each product categoryproduct lifecycle state are generally established and maintained based on a combination of historical experience forecasted sales and promotions technological obsolescence inventory age and other actual known conditions and circumstances should actual product marketability and raw material fitness for use be affected by conditions that are different from management estimates further adjustments to inventory allowances may be required 

pension benefits the pension benefit obligation and related pension expense are calculated in accordance with us gaap and are impacted by certain actuarial assumptions changes in these assumptions are primarily influenced by factors outside of snapon’s control and can have a significant effect on the amounts reported in the financial statements snapon believes that the two most critical assumptions are i the expected return on plan assets and ii the assumed discount rate 

pension expense increases as the expected rate of return on plan assets decreases lowering the expected rate of return assumption for snapon’s domestic pension plan assets by 50 basis points would have increased snapon’s 2013 domestic pension expense by approximately 40 million snapon uses a threeyear marketrelated value asset method of amortizing the difference between actual and expected returns on its domestic plans’ assets 

  

 

 

  

 

  

the objective of snapon’s discount rate assumption is to reflect the rate at which the pension benefits could be effectively settled in making this determination the company takes into account the timing and amount of benefits that would be available under the plans the domestic discount rate as of 2013 and 2012 year end was selected based on a cash flow matching methodology developed by the company’s outside actuaries and which incorporates a review of current economic conditions this methodology matches the plans’ yearly projected benefit cash flows to those of hypothetical bond portfolios using highquality aa rated or better corporate bonds from either moody’s investors service or standard  poor’s credit rating agencies available at the measurement date this technique calculates bond portfolios that produce adequate cash flows to pay the plans’ projected yearly benefits and then selects the portfolio with the highest yield and uses that yield as the recommended discount rate 

the selection of the 52 weightedaverage discount rate for snapon’s domestic pension plans as of 2013 year end represents the single rate that produces the same present value of cash flows as the estimated benefit plan payments lowering snapon’s domestic discount rate assumption by 50 basis points would have increased snapon’s 2013 domestic pension expense and projected benefit obligation by approximately 53 million and 509 million respectively as of 2013 year end snapon’s domestic projected benefit obligation comprised approximately 81 of snapon’s worldwide projected benefit obligation the weightedaverage discount rate for snapon’s foreign pension plans of 45 represents the single rate that produces the same present value of cash flows as the estimated benefit plan payments lowering snapon’s foreign discount rate assumption by 50 basis points would have increased snapon’s 2013 foreign pension expense and projected benefit obligation by approximately 20 million and 199 million respectively 

actuarial gains and losses in excess of 10 percent of the greater of the projected benefit obligation or marketrelated value of assets are amortized on a straightline basis over the average remaining service period of active participants or over the average remaining life expectancy for plans with primarily inactive participants prior service costs and credits resulting from plan amendments are amortized in equal annual amounts over the average remaining service period of affected active participants or over the remaining life expectancy of affected retired participants see note 11 to the consolidated financial statements for further information on pension plans 

postretirement benefits snapon’s postretirement benefits obligation and related expense are calculated in accordance with us gaap and are impacted by certain actuarial assumptions including health care trend rates as of 2013 year end a onepercentagepoint increase in the health care cost trend rate for future years would increase the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation by approximately 10 million and the aggregate of the service cost and interest cost components by less than 01 million conversely a onepercentagepoint decrease in the health care cost trend rate for future years would decrease the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation by 09 million and the aggregate of the service cost and interest cost components by less than 01 million see note 12 to the consolidated financial statements for further information on postretirement plans 

income taxes  snapon records deferred income tax assets and liabilities for differences between the book basis and tax basis of the related net assets snapon records a valuation allowance when appropriate to reduce its deferred tax assets if it is morelikelythannot that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized while the company has considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance if these estimates and assumptions change in the future the company may be required to adjust its valuation allowance this could result in a charge to or an increase in income in the period such determination is made 

in addition the company operates within multiple taxing jurisdictions and is subject to audit in these jurisdictions the company records accruals for the estimated outcomes of these audits and the accruals may change in the future due to new developments in each matter see note 8 to the consolidated financial statements for further information on income taxes 

outlook 

in 2014 snapon expects to continue with the advancement of its strategic framework designed to enhance its mobile tool distribution network expand in the vehicle repair garage extend to critical industries and build in emerging markets in pursuit of these initiatives snapon anticipates that capital expenditures in 2014 will be in a range of 70 million to 80 million snapon expects that its full year 2014 effective income tax rate will be comparable to its 2013 rate 

  

 

 

  

 

  




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

market credit and economic risks 

market risk is the potential economic loss that may result from adverse changes in the fair value of financial instruments snapon is exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates snapon is also exposed to market risk associated with the stockbased portion of its deferred compensation plans snapon monitors its exposure to these risks and attempts to manage the underlying economic exposures through the use of financial instruments such as foreign currency forward contracts interest rate swap agreements treasury lock agreements and prepaid equity forward agreements “equity forwards” snapon does not use derivative instruments for speculative or trading purposes snapon’s broadbased business activities help to reduce the impact that volatility in any particular area or related areas may have on its operating earnings as a whole snapon’s management takes an active role in the risk management process and has developed policies and procedures that require specific administrative and business functions to assist in the identification assessment and control of various risks 

foreign currency risk management 

snapon has significant international operations and is subject to certain risks inherent with foreign operations that include currency fluctuations foreign exchange risk exists to the extent that snapon has payment obligations or receipts denominated in currencies other than the functional currency including intercompany loans denominated in foreign currencies to manage these exposures snapon identifies naturally offsetting positions and then purchases hedging instruments to protect the residual net exposures see note 10 to the consolidated financial statements for information on foreign currency risk management 

interest rate risk management 

snapon aims to control funding costs by managing the exposure created by the differing maturities and interest rate structures of snapon’s borrowings through the use of interest rate swap agreements treasury lock agreements are used from time to time to manage potential changes in interest rates in anticipation of the issuance or sale of certain financial instruments see note 10 to the consolidated financial statements for information on interest rate risk management 

snapon utilizes a valueatrisk “var” model to determine the potential oneday loss in the fair value of its interest rate and foreign exchangesensitive financial instruments from adverse changes in market factors the var model estimates were made assuming normal market conditions and a 95 confidence level snapon’s computations are based on the interrelationships among movements in various currencies and interest rates variancecovariance technique these interrelationships were determined by observing interest rate and foreign currency market changes over the preceding quarter 

the estimated maximum potential oneday loss in fair value calculated using the var model as of 2013 and 2012 year end was 10 million and 13 million respectively on interest ratesensitive financial instruments and 05 million and 04 million respectively on foreign currencysensitive financial instruments the var model is a risk management tool and does not purport to represent actual losses in fair value that will be incurred by snapon nor does it consider the potential effect of favorable changes in market factors 

stockbased deferred compensation risk management 

snapon aims to manage market risk associated with the stockbased portion of its deferred compensation plans through the use of equity forwards equity forwards are used to aid in offsetting the potential marktomarket effect on stockbased deferred compensation from changes in snapon’s stock price since stockbased deferred compensation liabilities increase as the company’s stock price rises and decrease as the company’s stock price declines the equity forwards are intended to mitigate the potential impact on compensation expense that may result from such marktomarket changes see note 10 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on stockbased deferred compensation risk management 

  

 

 

  

 

  

credit risk 

credit risk is the possibility of loss from a customer’s failure to make payments according to contract terms prior to granting credit each customer is evaluated taking into consideration the borrower’s financial condition collateral debtservicing capacity past payment experience credit bureau information and other financial and qualitative factors that may affect the borrower’s ability to repay credit risk is also monitored regularly through the use of internal proprietary custom scoring models used to evaluate each transaction at the time of the application for credit and by periodically updating those credit scores for ongoing monitoring purposes snapon evaluates credit quality through the use of an internal proprietary measuring system that provides a framework to analyze finance and contract receivables on the basis of risk factors of the individual obligor as well as transaction specific risk the finance and contract receivables are typically monitored through an asset quality review process that closely monitors past due accounts and initiates a progressive collection action process when appropriate in addition to its direct credit risk exposure snapon also has credit risk exposure for certain socoriginated contracts with recourse provisions related to franchisee van leases sold by soc as of 2013 and 2012 year end 77 million and 133 million respectively of franchisee van leases contain a recourse provision to snapon if the leases become more than 90 days past due 

counterparty risk 

snapon is exposed to credit losses in the event of nonperformance by the counterparties to its various financial agreements including its foreign currency forward contracts interest rate swap agreements and prepaid equity forward agreements snapon does not obtain collateral or other security to support financial instruments subject to credit risk but monitors the credit standing of the counterparties and generally enters into agreements with financial institution counterparties with a credit rating of a or better snapon does not anticipate nonperformance by its counterparties but cannot provide assurances 

economic risk 

economic risk is the possibility of loss resulting from economic instability in certain areas of the world snapon continually monitors its exposure in these markets 

as a result of the above market credit and economic risks net income and revenues in any particular period may not be representative of fullyear results and may vary significantly from year to year inflation has not had a significant impact on the company 

commodity risk 

snapon is a purchaser of certain commodities such as steel natural gas and electricity the company is also a purchaser of components and parts that are integrated into the company’s end products as well as the purchaser of certain finished goods all of which may contain various commodities including steel aluminum and others snapon’s supply of raw materials and purchased components are generally and readily available from numerous suppliers 

the principal raw material used in the manufacture of the company’s products is steel which the company purchases in competitive pricesensitive markets to meet snapon’s high quality standards the company’s steel needs range from specialized alloys which are available only from a limited group of approved suppliers to commodity types of alloys these raw materials have historically exhibited price and demand cyclicality some of these materials have been and in the future may be in short supply particularly in the event of a general economic recovery mill shut downs or production cut backs as some steel alloys require specialized manufacturing procedures snapon could experience inventory shortages if it were required to use an alternative manufacturer on short notice additionally unexpected price increases for raw materials could result in higher prices to snapon’s customers or an erosion of the margins on its products 

snapon believes its ability to sell product is also dependent on the number of vehicles on the road the number of miles driven and the general aging of vehicles these factors affect the frequency type and amount of service and repair performed on vehicles by technicians and therefore affect the demand for the number of technicians the prosperity of the technicians and subsequently the demand technicians have for the company’s tools other products and services and the value technicians place on those products and services to the extent that the prices of gasoline and other petroleumbased fuels increase as they have at times in recent years consumers may turn to other methods of transportation including more frequent use of public transportation which could result in a decrease in the use of privately operated vehicles a decrease in the use of privately operated vehicles may lead to fewer repairs and less demand for the company’s products 

  

 

 

  

 

  

to the extent that commodity prices increase and the company does not have firm pricing agreements with its suppliers the company may experience margin declines to the extent that it is not able to increase the selling prices of its products

in the united states a significant portion of sales to the vehicle service and repair sector is conducted through snapon’s mobile franchise van channel snapon’s franchisees primarily serve vehicle repair technicians and vehicle service shop owners generally providing weekly contact at the customer’s place of business franchisees’ sales are concentrated in hand and power tools tool storage products and shop equipment and diagnostic and repair information products which can easily be transported in a van and demonstrated during a brief sales call franchisees purchase snapon’s products at a discount from suggested list prices and resell them at prices established by the franchisee us franchisees are provided a list of places of business that serves as the basis of the franchisee’s sales route 

snapon also has offered an option termed the “gateway franchise program” to potential us franchisees including those that did not meet the standard franchise qualification requirements gateway franchise program participants have less upfront investment and are provided an initial base level of consigned inventory from snapon to assist them in gaining experience and building equity toward the future purchase of a standard franchise snapon also provides certain franchisees the opportunity to add vans to their franchise or to add a limited number of additional franchises snapon charges nominal initial and ongoing monthly franchise fees since 1991 written franchise agreements have been entered into with all new us franchisees and most pre1991 independent franchisees as of 2012 year end there were 3209 vans operated by us franchisees approximately 97 with written franchise agreements or individuals employed by such franchisees as compared with 3177 vans approximately 97 as of 2011 year end 

in addition to its mobile van channel in the united states snapon has replicated its us franchise van distribution model in certain other countries including australia canada germany japan the united kingdom the netherlands south africa new zealand belgium and ireland in many of these markets as in the united states purchase decisions are generally made or influenced by professional vehicle service technicians as well as shop owners and managers as of 2012 year end snapon’s worldwide mobile van count was approximately 4800 including approximately 3500 vans in the united states 

through soc financing is available to us franchisees including financing for van and truck leases working capital loans and loans to enable new franchisees to fund the purchase of the franchise in many international markets snapon offers a variety of financing options to its franchisees andor customer networks through its international finance subsidiaries the decision to finance through snapon or another financing entity is solely at the customer’s election 

snapon supports its franchisees with a field organization of regional offices franchise performance teams diagnostic sales developers “dsds” customer care centers and distribution centers snapon also provides sales and business training and marketing and product promotion programs as well as customer and franchisee financing programs through soc and the company’s international finance subsidiaries all of which are designed to strengthen franchisee sales in north america the united states national franchise advisory council and the canadian national franchise advisory council both of which are composed primarily of franchisees that are elected by franchisees assist snapon in identifying and implementing enhancements to the franchise program 

in the united states franchisees work closely with dsds dsds train franchisees on the sale of higherpricepoint diagnostics and demonstrate and sell vehicle service shop management and information systems dsds work independently and with franchisees to identify and generate sales among vehicle service technicians shop owners and managers dsds are snapon employees who are compensated through a combination of base salary and commission a franchisee receives a brokerage fee from certain sales made by the dsds to the franchisee’s customers most products sold through franchisees and dsds are sold under the snapon bluepoint and shopkey brand names 

snapon also has a companyowned van program in the united states that is designed to i provide another pool of potential franchisees and field organization personnel ii service customers in select new andor open routes not currently serviced by franchisees and iii allow snapon to pilot new sales and promotional ideas prior to introducing them to franchisees as of 2012 year end companyowned vans comprised approximately 5 of the total us van population snapon may elect to increase or reduce the number of companyowned vans in the future 

  

 

 

  

 

  

company direct sales 

a significant proportion of shop equipment sales in north america under the john bean hofmann and blackhawk brands diagnostic products under the snapon brand and information products under the mitchell1 brand are made by direct and independent sales forces that have responsibility for national and other accounts as the vehicle service and repair sector consolidates with more business conducted by national chains and franchised service centers snapon believes these larger organizations can be serviced most effectively by sales people who can demonstrate and sell the full line of equipment and diagnostic products and services snapon also sells these products and services directly to oems and their franchised dealers 

snapon brand tools and equipment are marketed to industrial and governmental customers in the united states through both industrial sales representatives who are employees and independent industrial distributors outside of the united states industrial sales are also conducted through other independent distributors sales representatives focus on industrial customers whose main purchase criteria are quality and service as of 2012 year end snapon had industrial sales representatives in the united states including puerto rico australia canada japan mexico and various european asian latin american and middle eastern countries with the united states representing the majority of snapon’s total industrial sales 

snapon also sells software services and solutions to the automotive power equipment and sports segments products and services are marketed to targeted groups including oems and their dealerships and individual repair shops to effectively reach oems such as general motors company daimler ag ford motor company chrysler group llc toyota motor corporation john deere deere  company cnh global nv jc bamford excavators ltd jcb and yamaha corporation snapon has deployed focused business teams globally 

distributors 

sales of certain tools and equipment are made through independent distributors who purchase the items from snapon and resell them to end users hand tools under the bahco fish and hook and lindström brands and trade names for example are sold through distributors in europe north and south america asia and certain other parts of the world wheel service and other vehicle service equipment are sold through distributors primarily under brands including hofmann john bean cartec and blackhawk diagnostics and equipment are marketed through distributors in south america and asia and through both a direct sales force and distributors in europe under the snapon sun bahco and bluepoint brands 

ecommerce 

snapon’s ecommerce development initiatives allow snapon to combine the capabilities of the internet with snapon’s existing brand sales and distribution strengths to reach new and underserved customer segments snapon offers current and prospective customers online aroundtheclock access to research and purchase products through its public internet web site at wwwsnaponcom  the site features an online catalog containing nearly 15000 products including snapon hand tools power tools tool storage units and diagnostic equipment available to consumers and professionals in the united states the united kingdom canada and australia as of 2012 year end snapon had more than 900000 registered users including approximately 51000 industrial accounts ecommerce and certain other system enhancement initiatives are designed to improve productivity and further leverage the oneonone relationships and service snapon has with its current and prospective customers through businesstobusiness and businesstoconsumer capabilities snapon and its franchisees are enhancing communications with customers on a realtime 24 hour 7 day a week basis 

competition 

snapon competes on the basis of its product quality and performance product line breadth and depth service brand awareness and imagery technological innovation and availability of financing through soc or its international finance subsidiaries while no single company competes with snapon across all of its product lines and distribution channels various companies compete in one or more product categories andor distribution channels 

  

 

 

  

 

  

snapon believes it is a leading manufacturer and distributor of professional tools tool storage diagnostics equipment repair software and solutions offering a broad line of these products to both vehicle service and industrial marketplaces various competitors target and sell to professional technicians in the automotive service and repair sector through the mobile van channel snapon also competes with companies that sell tools and equipment to automotive technicians through retail stores and online auto parts supply outlets and tool supply warehousesdistributorships within the power tools category and the industrial sector snapon has various other competitors including companies with offerings that overlap with other areas discussed herein major competitors selling diagnostics shop equipment and information to automotive dealerships and independent repair shops include oems and their proprietary electronic parts catalogs diagnostics and information systems as well as other companies that offer products serving this sector 

raw materials and purchased product 

snapon’s supply of raw materials and purchased components are generally and readily available from numerous suppliers snapon believes it has secured an ample supply of both bar and coil steel for the near future to ensure stable supply to meet material demands the company does not currently anticipate experiencing any significant impact in 2013 from steel pricing or availability issues 

patents trademarks and other intellectual property 

snapon vigorously pursues and relies on patent protection to protect its intellectual property and position in its markets as of 2012 year end snapon and its subsidiaries held over 600 active and pending patents in the united states and over 1500 active and pending patents outside of the united states sales relating to any single patent did not represent a material portion of snapon’s revenues in any of the last three years 

examples of products that have features or designs that benefit from patent protection include wheel alignment systems wheel balancers tire changers lifts test lanes sealed ratchets electronic torque instruments ratcheting screwdrivers emissionssensing devices and diagnostic equipment 

much of the technology used in the manufacture of vehicle service tools and equipment is in the public domain snapon relies primarily on trade secret protection to protect proprietary processes used in manufacturing methods and processes are patented when appropriate copyright protection is also utilized when appropriate 

trademarks used by snapon are of continuing importance to snapon in the marketplace trademarks have been registered in the united states and more than 100 other countries and additional applications for trademark registrations are pending snapon vigorously polices proper use of its trademarks snapon’s right to manufacture and sell certain products is dependent upon licenses from others however these products under license do not represent a material portion of snapon’s net sales 

domain names have become a valuable corporate asset for companies around the world including snapon domain names often contain a trademark or service mark or even a corporate name and are often considered intellectual property the recognition and value of the snapon name trademark and domain name are core strengths of the company 

snapon strategically licenses the snapon brand to carefully selected manufacturing and distribution companies for items such as apparel work boots lighting and a variety of other goods in order to further build equity and market presence for the company’s strongest brand 

environmental 

snapon is subject to various environmental laws ordinances regulations and other requirements of government authorities in the united states and other nations at snapon these environmental liabilities are managed through the snapon environmental health and safety management system “eh  sms” which is applied worldwide the system is based upon continual improvement and is certified to iso 140012004 and ohsas 180012007 verified through det norske veritas dnv certification inc 

  

 

 

  

 

  

snapon believes that it complies with applicable environmental control requirements in its operations expenditures on environmental matters through eh  sms have not had and snapon does not for the foreseeable future expect them to have a material effect upon snapon’s capital expenditures earnings or competitive position 

employees 

snapon employed approximately 11200 people at the end of january 2013 snapon employed approximately 11500 people at the end of january 2012 

approximately 2700 employees or 24 of snapon’s worldwide workforce are represented by unions andor covered under collective bargaining agreements the number of covered union employees whose contracts expire within the next five years approximates 900 employees in 2013 1350 employees in 2014 and 50 employees in 2015 there are no contracts currently scheduled to expire in 2016 or 2017 in recent years snapon has not experienced any significant work slowdowns stoppages or other labor disruptions 

there can be no assurance that these and other future contracts with snapon’s unions will be renegotiated upon terms acceptable to snapon 

working capital 

most of snapon’s businesses are not seasonal and their inventory needs are relatively constant snapon did not have a significant backlog of orders at 2012 year end in recent years snapon has been using its working capital to fund in part the growth of the onbook receivables originated by soc 

snapon’s liquidity and capital resources and use of working capital are discussed herein in “part ii item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” 

as of 2012 year end neither snapon nor any of its segments depend on any single customer small group of customers or government for any material part of its revenues 




 item 1a risk factors 

in evaluating the company careful consideration should be given to the following risk factors in addition to the other information included in this annual report on form 10k including the consolidated financial statements and the related notes each of these risk factors could adversely affect the company’s business operating results cash flows andor financial condition as well as adversely affect the value of an investment in the company’s common stock 

economic conditions and world events could affect our operating results 

we our franchisees and our customers may continue to be adversely affected by challenging economic conditions including conditions that may particularly impact specific regions such as europe which approximated 21 of our revenues in 2012 these conditions may result in reduced consumer and investor confidence instability in the credit and financial markets volatile corporate profits and reduced business as well as consumer spending we our franchisees and our customers and the economy as a whole also may be affected by future world or local events outside our control such as acts of terrorism developments in the war on terrorism conflicts in international situations and natural disasters these factors may affect our results of operations by reducing our sales margins andor net income as a result of a slowdown in customer orders or order cancellations impact the availability of raw materials andor the supply chain and could potentially lead to future impairment of our intangible assets in addition political and social turmoil related to international conflicts and terrorist acts may put pressure on economic conditions abroad unstable political social and economic conditions may make it difficult for our franchisees customers suppliers and us to accurately forecast and plan future business activities if such conditions persist our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows could be negatively affected 

  

 

 

  

 

  

raw material and energy price fluctuations and shortages including steel and various fuel sources could adversely affect the ability to obtain needed manufacturing materials and could adversely affect our results of operations 

the principal raw material used in the manufacture of our products is steel which we purchase in competitive pricesensitive markets to meet snapon’s high quality standards our steel needs range from specialized alloys which are available only from a limited group of approved suppliers to commodity types of alloys these raw materials have historically exhibited price and demand fluctuations of a cyclical nature some of these materials have been and in the future may be in short supply particularly in the event of a general economic recovery mill shut downs or production cut backs as some steel alloys require specialized manufacturing procedures we could experience inventory shortages if we were required to use an alternative manufacturer on short notice additionally unexpected price increases for other raw materials could result in higher prices to our customers or an erosion of the margins on our products 

we believe our ability to sell our products is also dependent on the number of vehicles on the road the number of miles driven and the general aging of vehicles these factors affect the frequency type and amount of service and repair performed on vehicles by technicians and therefore affect the demand for the number of technicians the prosperity of the technicians and subsequently the demand technicians have for our tools other products and services and the value technicians place on those products and services to the extent that the prices of gasoline and other petroleumbased fuels increase as they have at times in recent years consumers may turn to other methods of transportation including more frequent use of public transportation which could result in a decrease in the use of privately operated vehicles a decrease in the use of privately operated vehicles may lead to fewer repairs and less demand for our products 

we use various energy sources to transport produce and distribute products and some of our products have components that are petroleum based petroleum and energy prices have periodically increased significantly over short periods of time further volatility and changes may be caused by market fluctuations supply and demand currency fluctuation production and transportation disruption world events and changes in governmental programs energy price increases raise both our operating costs and the costs of our materials and we may not be able to increase our prices enough to offset these costs higher prices also may reduce the level of future customer orders and our profitability 

exposure to credit risks of customers and resellers may make it difficult to collect receivables and could adversely affect operating results and financial condition 

industry and economic conditions have the potential to weaken the financial position of some of our customers if circumstances surrounding our customers’ ability to repay their credit obligations were to deteriorate and result in the writedown or writeoff of such receivables it would negatively affect our operating results for the period in which they occur and if large could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

regulatory changes related to financial services operations could adversely affect operating results and financial condition 

financial services businesses of all kinds are subject to increasing regulation in addition to potentially increasing the costs of doing business due to compliance obligations new laws and regulations or changes to existing laws and regulations as well as the enforcement thereof may affect the relationships between creditors and debtors inhibit the rights of creditors to collect amounts owed to them or limit the types of financial products or services offered any or all of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

new and stricter legislation and regulations may affect our business and results of operations 

increased legislative and regulatory activity and burdens and a more stringent manner in which they are applied particularly in the united states could significantly impact our business and the economy as a whole for example the affordable care act the “aca” which was adopted in 2010 and is being phased in over several years significantly affects the provision of both health care services and benefits in the united states the aca may impact our cost of providing our employees and retirees with health insurance andor benefits and may also impact various other aspects of our business the aca did not have a material impact on our fiscal 2012 2011 or 2010 financial results however we are continuing to assess the impact of the aca on our health care benefit costs also the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act of 2010 the “doddfrank act” may affect among other matters our financial services businesses by requiring changes in the way in which we provide credit or by otherwise increasing the expenses of that operation as well as the costs related to corporate governance sourcing compliance disclosures and general securities law compliance 

these developments and other potential future legislation and regulations as well as the increasingly strict regulatory environment may also adversely affect the customers to which and the markets into which we sell our products and increase our costs and otherwise negatively affect our business financial condition or results of operations including in ways that cannot yet be foreseen 

  

 

 

  

 

  

the performance of snapon’s mobile van tool distribution business depends on the success of its franchisees 

approximately 41 of our 2012 revenues were generated by the snapon tools group which consists of snapon’s business operations serving the worldwide van channel except in limited circumstances each of our mobile tool vans is operated by a franchisee pursuant to a franchise agreement snapon’s success is dependent on its relationships with franchisees individually and collectively as they are the primary sales and service link between the company and vehicle service and repair technicians who are an important class of end users for snapon’s products and services if our franchisees are not successful or if we do not maintain an effective relationship with our franchisees the delivery of products the collection of receivables andor our relationship with end users could be adversely affected and thereby negatively impact our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

in addition if we are unable to maintain effective relationships with franchisees snapon or the franchisees may choose to terminate the relationship which may result in i open routes in which enduser customers are not provided reliable service ii litigation resulting from termination iii reduced collections or increased writeoffs of franchisee receivables owed to snapon andor iv reduced collections or increased writeoffs of extended credit contracts and to a lesser extent lease contracts that are collected by franchisees on behalf of soc 

instability and uncertainty in the credit and financial markets could adversely impact the availability of credit that we and our customers need to operate our businesses 

we depend upon the availability of credit to operate our business including the financing of receivables from enduser customers that are originated by our financial services businesses our enduser customers franchisees and suppliers also require access to credit for their businesses instability and uncertainty in the credit and financial markets could adversely impact the availability of future financing and the terms on which it might be available to snapon its enduser customers franchisees and suppliers inability to access credit markets or a deterioration in the terms on which financing might be available could have an adverse impact on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

increasing our financial leverage could affect our operations and profitability 

the company’s leverage ratio may affect both our availability of additional capital resources as well as our operations in several ways including 

 

     while we believe we will have the ability to service our debt and obtain additional resources in the future if and when needed that will depend upon our results of operations and financial position at the time the thencurrent state of the credit and financial markets and other factors that may be beyond our control therefore we cannot give assurances that credit will be available on terms that we consider attractive or at all if and when necessary or beneficial to us 

failure to achieve expected investment returns on pension plan assets as well as changes in interest rates could adversely impact our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

snapon sponsors various defined benefit pension plans the “pension plans” the assets of the pension plans are broadly diversified in an attempt to mitigate the risk of a large loss the assets are invested in equity securities debt securities real estate and other real assets hedge funds other alternative investments and cash required funding for the company’s domestic defined benefit pension plans is determined in accordance with guidelines set forth in the federal employee retirement income security act erisa foreign defined benefit pension plans are funded in accordance with local statutes or practice additional contributions to enhance the funded status of the pension plans can be made at the company’s discretion however there can be no assurance that the value of the pension plan assets or the investment returns on those plan assets will be sufficient to meet the future benefit obligations of such plans in addition during periods of adverse investment market conditions and declining interest rates the company may be required to make additional cash contributions to the plans that could reduce our financial flexibility 

  

 

 

  

 

  

our pension plan obligations are affected by changes in market interest rates significant fluctuations in market interest rates have added and may further add volatility to our pension plan obligations in recent years declining market interest rates have increased our pension plan obligations if market interest rates continue to decline our pension plan obligations will increase while our plan assets are broadly diversified there are inherent market risks associated with investments if adverse market conditions occur our plan assets could incur significant or material losses since we may need to make additional contributions to address an increase in obligations andor a loss in plan assets the combination of declining market interest rates andor past or future plan asset investment losses could adversely impact our financial position results of operations and cash flows 

the company’s pension plan expense is comprised of the following factors i service cost ii interest on projected benefit obligations iii the expected return on plan assets iv the amortization of prior service costs and credits v the effects of actuarial gains and losses and vi settlementcurtailment costs when applicable the accounting for pensions involves the estimation of a number of factors that are highly uncertain certain factors such as the interest cost and the expected return on plan assets are impacted by changes in market interest rates and the value of plan assets a significant decrease in market interest rates and a decrease in the fair value of plan assets would increase net pension expense and may adversely affect the company’s future results of operations see note 11 to the consolidated financial statements for further information on the company’s pension plans 

our inability to provide acceptable financing alternatives to enduser customers and franchisees could adversely impact our operating results 

an integral component of our business and profitability is our ability to offer competitive financing alternatives to enduser customers and franchisees the lack of our ability to obtain capital resources or other financing to support our onbook receivables on terms that we believe are attractive whether resulting from the state of the financial markets our own operating performance or other factors would negatively affect our operating results and financial condition adverse fluctuations in interest rates andor our ability to provide competitive financing programs for other reasons could also have an adverse impact on our revenue and profitability 

the steps taken to restructure operations rationalize operating footprint lower operating expenses and achieve greater efficiencies in the supply chain could disrupt business 

we have taken steps in the past and expect to take additional steps in 2013 intended to improve customer service and drive further efficiencies and reduce costs some of which could be disruptive to our business these actions collectively across our operating groups are focused on the following 

 

       we believe that by executing on these focus areas and continuing our commitment to new innovative products and rci initiatives to drive higher levels of productivity and lower costs the company and its franchisees may realize stronger growth and profitability however failure to succeed in the implementation of any or all of these actions could result in an inability to achieve our financial goals and could be disruptive to the business 

in addition future reductions to headcount and other cost reduction measures may result in the loss of technical expertise that could adversely affect our research and development efforts as well as our ability to meet product development schedules efforts to reduce components of expense could result in the recording of charges for inventory and technologyrelated writeoffs workforce reduction costs or other charges relating to the consolidation or closure of facilities if we were to incur a substantial charge to further these efforts our earnings per share would be adversely affected in such period if we are unable to effectively manage our cost reduction and restructuring efforts our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows could be negatively affected 

  

 

 

  

 

  

failure to maintain effective distribution of products and services could adversely impact revenue gross margin and profitability 

we use a variety of distribution methods to sell our products and services successfully managing the interaction of our distribution efforts to reach various potential customer segments for our products and services is a complex process moreover since each distribution method has distinct risks costs and gross margins our failure to implement the most advantageous balance in the delivery model for our products and services could adversely affect our revenue and gross margins and therefore our profitability 

risks associated with the disruption of manufacturing operations could adversely affect profitability or competitive position 

we manufacture a significant portion of the products we sell any prolonged disruption in the operations of our existing manufacturing facilities whether due to technical or labor difficulties facility consolidation or closure actions lack of raw material or component availability destruction of or damage to any facility as a result of natural disasters use and storage of hazardous materials or other events or other reasons could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

the inability to continue to introduce new products that respond to customer needs and achieve market acceptance could result in lower revenues and reduced profitability 

sales from new products represent a significant portion of our net sales and are expected to continue to represent a significant component of our future net sales we may not be able to compete effectively unless we continue to enhance existing products or introduce new products to the marketplace in a timely manner product improvements and new product introductions require significant financial and other resources including significant planning design development and testing at the technological product and manufacturing process levels our competitors’ new products may beat our products to market be more effective with more features be less expensive than our products andor render our products obsolete any new products that we develop may not receive market acceptance or otherwise generate any meaningful net sales or profits for us relative to our expectations based on among other things existing and anticipated investments in manufacturing capacity and commitments to fund advertising marketing promotional programs and research and development 

the global tool equipment and diagnostics and repair information industries are competitive 

we face strong competition in all of our market segments price competition in our various industries is intense and pricing pressures from competitors and customers are increasing in general as a manufacturer and marketer of premium products and services the expectations of snapon’s customers and its franchisees are high and increasing any inability to maintain customer satisfaction could diminish snapon’s premium image and reputation and could result in a lessening of our ability to command premium pricing we expect that the level of competition will remain high in the future which could limit our ability to maintain or increase market share or profitability 

product liability claims and litigation could affect our business reputation financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

the products that we design andor manufacture can lead to product liability claims being filed against us to the extent that plaintiffs are successful in showing that defects in the design or manufacture of our products led to personal injury or property damage we may be subject to claims for damages although we are insured for damages above a certain amount we bear the costs and expenses associated with defending claims including frivolous lawsuits and are responsible for damages below the insurance retention amount as a manufacturer we can be subject to the costs and potential negative publicity of product recalls which could impact our results 

  

 

 

  

 

  

information technology infrastructure and security are critical to supporting business objectives failure of our information technology infrastructure to operate effectively could adversely affect our business 

we depend heavily on information technology infrastructure to achieve our business objectives if a problem occurs that impairs or compromises this infrastructure including due to security breaches or malicious attacks or during systems upgrades andor new systems implementations the resulting disruption could impede our ability to record or process orders manufacture and ship in a timely manner protect sensitive data of the company our customers our suppliers and business partners or otherwise carry on business in the normal course any such events could cause us to lose customers andor revenue and could require us to incur significant expense to remediate including as a result of legal claims or proceedings 

in association with initiatives to better integrate business units rationalize operating footprint and improve responsiveness to franchisees and customers snapon is continually replacing and enhancing its global enterprise resource planning erp management information systems as we integrate implement and deploy new information technology processes and a common information infrastructure across our global operations we could experience disruptions in our business that could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

the recognition of impairment charges on goodwill or other intangible assets would adversely impact our future financial position and results of operations 

we have a substantial amount of goodwill and purchased intangible assets almost all of which are booked in the commercial  industrial and repair systems  information groups we are required to perform impairment tests on our goodwill and other intangibles annually or at any time when events occur that could impact the value of our business segments our determination of whether impairment has occurred is based on a comparison of each of our reporting units’ fair market value with its carrying value significant and unanticipated changes in circumstances such as significant and longterm adverse changes in business climate including in europe adverse actions by regulators unanticipated competition the loss of key customers andor changes in technology or markets could require a provision for impairment in a future period that could substantially impact our reported earnings and reduce our consolidated net worth and shareholders’ equity should the economic environment in these markets deteriorate our results of operations and financial position could be materially impacted including as a result of the effects of potential impairment writedowns of goodwill andor other intangible assets related to these businesses 

failure to adequately protect intellectual property could adversely affect our business 

intellectual property rights are an important and integral component of our business we attempt to protect our intellectual property rights through a combination of patent trademark copyright and trade secret laws as well as licensing agreements and thirdparty nondisclosure and assignment agreements adverse determinations in a judicial or administrative proceeding could prevent us from manufacturing and selling our products or prevent us from stopping others from manufacturing and selling competing products failure to obtain or maintain adequate protection of our intellectual property rights for any reason could have a material adverse effect on our business 

foreign operations are subject to currency exchange political economic and other risks that could adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

the reporting currency for snapon’s consolidated financial statements is the us dollar certain of the company’s assets liabilities expenses and revenues are denominated in currencies other than the us dollar in preparing snapon’s consolidated financial statements those assets liabilities expenses and revenues are translated into us dollars at applicable exchange rates increases or decreases in exchange rates between the us dollar and other currencies affect the us dollar value of those items as reflected in the consolidated financial statements substantial fluctuations in the value of the us dollar could have a significant impact on the company’s financial condition and results of operations 

approximately 38 of our revenues in 2012 were generated outside of the united states future growth rates and success of our business depends in large part on continued growth in our nonus operations including growth in emerging markets and critical industries numerous risks and uncertainties affect our nonus operations these risks and uncertainties include political economic and social instability such as acts of war civil disturbance or acts of terrorism local labor conditions changes in government policies and regulations including imposition or increases in withholding and other taxes on remittances and other payments by international subsidiaries currency instability transportation delays or interruptions sovereign debt uncertainties and difficulties in enforcement of contract and intellectual property rights as well as natural disasters should the economic environment in our nonus markets 

  

 

 

  

 

  

deteriorate from current levels our results of operations and financial position could be materially impacted including as a result of the effects of potential impairment writedowns of goodwill andor other intangible assets related to these businesses 

we are also affected by changes in inflation rates and interest rates additionally cash generated in nonus jurisdictions may be difficult to repatriate to the united states in a taxefficient manner our foreign operations are also subject to other risks and challenges such as the need to staff and manage diverse workforces respond to the needs of multiple national and international marketplaces and differing business climates and cultures in various countries 

our operations expose us to the risk of environmental liabilities costs litigation and violations that could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and reputation 

certain of our operations are subject to environmental laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which they operate which impose limitations on the discharge of pollutants into the ground air and water and establish standards for the generation treatment use storage and disposal of hazardous wastes we must also comply with various health and safety regulations in the united states and abroad in connection with our operations failure to comply with any of these laws could result in civil and criminal monetary and nonmonetary penalties and damage to our reputation in addition we may incur costs related to remedial efforts or alleged environmental damage associated with past or current waste disposal practices legislation has been proposed and governmental regulatory action has been both proposed and taken that may significantly impact environmental compliance in the united states these actions could increase our costs of production by raising the cost of energy as well as by further restricting emissions or other processes that we currently use in our operations we cannot provide assurance that our costs of complying with current or future environmental protection and health and safety laws will not exceed our estimates 

legal disputes could adversely affect our business reputation financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

from time to time we are subject to legal disputes that are being litigated andor settled in the ordinary course of business disputes or future lawsuits could result in the diversion of management’s time and attention away from business operations additionally negative developments with respect to legal disputes and the costs incurred in defending ourselves could have an adverse impact on the company and its reputation adverse outcomes or settlements could also require us to pay damages potentially in excess of amounts reserved or incur liability for other remedies that could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

the inability to successfully defend claims from taxing authorities could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we conduct business in many countries which requires us to interpret the income tax laws and rulings in each of those taxing jurisdictions due to the subjectivity of tax laws between those jurisdictions as well as the subjectivity of factual interpretations our estimates of income tax liabilities may differ from actual payments or assessments claims from taxing authorities related to these differences could have an adverse impact on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

compliance with new regulations related to conflict minerals could increase costs and affect the manufacturing and sale of our products 

pursuant to the doddfrank act and sec rules related thereto public companies are required to disclose the use of tin tantalum tungsten and gold collectively “conflict minerals” mined from the democratic republic of the congo and adjoining countries the “covered countries” if a conflict minerals is necessary to the functionality of a product manufactured or contracted to be manufactured by the company the rules require us to perform reasonable due diligence to determine if we know or have reason to believe that any of our products contain conflict minerals that may have originated from a covered country while these rules are currently the subject of a legal challenge at the current time we believe these new disclosure requirements will require due diligence efforts for snapon’s 2013 fiscal year with the initial disclosure if applicable due in may 2014 

certain products or components we obtain from our suppliers may contain some or all of these materials because our global supply chain is complex and can have multiple layers we may not as a result of our due diligence procedures be able to sufficiently verify the origins of the relevant minerals used in our products which could lead to the need for additional investigation and expense and ultimately could have a negative impact on our business or reputation we may

contractual obligations and commitments 

a summary of snapon’s future contractual obligations and commitments as of 2012 year end are as follows 

 

 snapon intends to make contributions of 102 million to its foreign pension plans and 16 million to its domestic pension plans in 2013 as required by law depending on market and other conditions snapon may elect to make discretionary cash contributions to its domestic pension plans in 2013 snapon has not presented estimated pension and postretirement funding contributions in the table above as the funding can vary from year to year based upon changes in the fair value of the plan assets and actuarial assumptions see notes 11 and 12 to the consolidated financial statements for information on the company’s benefit plans and payments 

due to the uncertainty of the timing of settlements with taxing authorities snapon is unable to make reasonably reliable estimates of the period of cash settlement of unrecognized tax benefits for its remaining uncertain tax liabilities as a result 68 million of unrecognized tax benefits have been excluded from the table above see note 8 to the consolidated financial statements for information on income taxes 

environmental matters 

snapon is subject to various federal state and local government requirements regulating the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment snapon’s policy is to comply with these requirements and the company believes that as a general matter its policies practices and procedures are properly designed to prevent unreasonable risk of environmental damage and of resulting financial liability in connection with its business some risk of environmental damage is however inherent in some of snapon’s operations and products as it is with other companies engaged in similar businesses 

snapon is and has been engaged in the handling manufacture use and disposal of many substances classified as hazardous or toxic by one or more regulatory agencies snapon believes that as a general matter its handling manufacture use and disposal of these substances are in accordance with environmental laws and regulations it is possible however that future knowledge or other developments such as improved capability to detect substances in the environment or increasingly strict environmental laws and standards and enforcement policies could bring into question the company’s handling manufacture use or disposal of these substances 

affordable care act

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the consolidated financial statements and related notes contain information that is pertinent to management’s discussion and analysis the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period these estimates are generally based on historical experience current conditions and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily available from other sources as well as identifying and assessing our accounting treatment with respect to commitments and contingencies actual results could differ from those estimates 

the company’s significant accounting policies are described in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements 

snapon considers the following policies and estimates to be the most critical in understanding the judgments that are involved in the preparation of the company’s consolidated financial statements and the uncertainties that could impact the company’s financial position results of operations and cash flows 

revenue recognition snapon recognizes revenue from the sale of tools diagnostics and equipment solutions when contract terms are met the price is fixed or determinable collectability is reasonably assured and a product is shipped or risk of ownership has been transferred to and accepted by the customer for sales contingent upon customer acceptance revenue recognition is deferred until such obligations are fulfilled estimated product returns are recorded as a reduction in reported revenues at the time of sale based upon historical product return experience and gross profit margin adjusted for known trends provisions for customer volume rebates discounts and allowances are also recorded as a reduction of reported revenues at the time of sale based on historical experience and known trends revenue related to maintenance and subscription agreements is recognized over the terms of the respective agreements 

snapon also recognizes revenue related to multiple element arrangements including sales of hardware software and softwarerelated services when a sales arrangement contains multiple elements such as hardware and software products andor services snapon uses the relative selling price method to allocate revenues between hardware and software elements for software elements that are not essential to the hardware’s functionality and related software postcontract customer support vendor specific objective evidence “vsoe” of fair value is used to further allocate revenue to each element based on its relative fair value and when necessary the residual method is used to assign value to the delivered elements when vsoe only exists for the undelivered elements the amount assigned to the products or services is recognized when the product is delivered andor when the services are performed in instances where the product andor services are performed over an extended period as is the case with subscription agreements or the providing of ongoing support revenue is generally recognized on a straightline basis over the term of the agreement which generally ranges from 12 to 60 months 

franchise fee revenue franchise fee revenue including nominal nonrefundable initial fees is recognized upon the granting of a franchise which is when the company has performed substantially all initial services required by the franchise agreement franchise fee revenue also includes ongoing monthly fees primarily for sales and business training and marketing and product promotion programs that are recognized as the fees are earned franchise fee revenue totaled 99 million 88 million and 90 million in fiscal 2012 2011 and 2010 respectively 

financial services revenue snapon also generates revenue from various financing programs that include i loans to franchisees’ customers and snapon’s industrial and other customers for the purchase or lease of tools equipment and diagnostics on an extended term payment plan and ii business loans and vehicle leases to franchisees these financing programs are offered through snapon’s finance subsidiaries financial services revenue consists primarily of finance loan receivable revenue and installment contract revenue revenue from interest income on the onbook financing portfolio is recognized over the life of the contracts with interest computed on the average daily balances of the underlying contracts financial services revenue also includes servicing fee income received from cit prior to july 2009 soc substantially sold all of its loan originations to cit on a limited recourse basis and soc retained the right to service such loans for a contractual servicing fee contractual servicing fees from cit were 14 million 23 million and 49 million in fiscal 2012 2011 and 2010 respectively 

  

 

 

 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued 

 

 

 

  

the decision to finance through snapon or another financing entity is solely at the election of the customer when assessing customers for potential financing snapon considers various factors regarding ability to pay including customers’ financial condition collateral debtservicing ability past payment experience and credit bureau information for finance and contract receivables snapon assesses these factors through the use of credit quality indicators consisting primarily of customer credit risk scores combined with internal credit risk grades collection experience and other internal metrics 

financial services lease arrangements snapon accounts for its financial services leases as direct financing or salestype leases the company determines the gross investment in the lease as the present value of the minimum lease payments using the interest rate implicit in the lease net of amounts if any included therein for executor costs to be paid by snapon together with any profit thereon the difference between the gross investment in the lease and the cost of the leased property is reported as unearned finance charges unearned finance charges are amortized to income over the life of the contract with interest computed on the average daily balance of the underlying contract the default covenants included in the lease arrangements are usual and customary consistent with industry practice and do not impact the lease classification except in circumstances where the company has concluded that a lessee’s financial condition has deteriorated the other default covenants under snapon’s lease arrangements are objectively determinable 

impairment of goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets  goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets are tested for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the assets might be impaired annual impairment tests are performed by the company in the second quarter of each year 

snapon evaluates the recoverability of goodwill by estimating the future discounted cash flows of the businesses to which the goodwill relates estimated cash flows and related goodwill are grouped at the reporting unit level the company has determined that its reporting units for testing goodwill impairment are its operating segments or components of an operating segment that constitute a business for which discrete financial information is available and for which segment management regularly reviews the operating results within its four reportable operating segments the company has identified 11 reporting units 

snapon evaluates the recoverability of goodwill by utilizing an income approach that estimates the fair value of the future discounted cash flows of the reporting units to which the goodwill relates the future projections which are based on both past performance and the projections and assumptions used in the company’s operating plans are subject to change as a result of changing economic and competitive conditions this approach reflects management’s internal outlook at the reporting units which management believes provides the best determination of value due to management’s insight and experience with the reporting unit significant estimates used by management in the discounted cash flows methodology include estimates of future cash flows based on expected growth rates price increases working capital levels expected benefits from rci initiatives and a weightedaverage cost of capital that reflects the specific risk profile of the reporting unit being tested the company’s methodologies for valuing goodwill are applied consistently on a yearoveryear basis the assumptions used in performing the second quarter 2012 impairment calculations were evaluated in light of current market and business conditions snapon continues to believe that the future discounted cash flow valuation model provides the most reasonable and meaningful fair value estimate based upon the reporting units’ projections of future operating results and cash flows and replicates how market participants would value the company’s reporting units in an orderly transaction 

in the event the fair value of a reporting unit is less than the carrying value including goodwill the company would then perform an additional assessment that would compare the implied fair value of goodwill with the carrying amount of goodwill the determination of implied fair value of goodwill would require management to compare the estimated fair value of the reporting unit to the estimated fair value of the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit if necessary the company may consult with valuation specialists to assist with the assessment of the estimated fair value of the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit if the implied fair value of the goodwill is less than the carrying value an impairment loss would be recorded 

  

 

 

  

 

  

snapon also evaluates the recoverability of its indefinitelived trademarks by utilizing an income approach that estimates the fair value of the future discounted cash flows of each of its trademarks the future projections which are based on both past performance and the projections and assumptions used in the company’s operating plans are subject to change as a result of changing economic and competitive conditions significant estimates used by management in the discounted cash flows methodology include estimates of future cash flows based on expected growth and royalty rates expected synergies and a weightedaverage cost of capital that reflects the specific risk profile of the trademark being tested the company’s methodologies for valuing trademarks are applied consistently on a yearoveryear basis the assumptions used in performing the second quarter 2012 impairment calculations were evaluated in light of current market and business conditions snapon continues to believe that the future discounted cash flow valuation model provides the most reasonable and meaningful fair value estimate based upon the trademarks’ projected future cash flows and replicates how market participants would value the company’s trademarks in an orderly transaction 

inherent in fair value determinations are significant judgments and estimates including material assumptions about future revenue profitability and cash flows the company’s operational plans and its interpretation of current economic indicators should the operations of the businesses with which goodwill or other indefinitelived intangible assets are associated incur significant declines in profitability and cash flow due to significant and longterm deterioration in macroeconomic industry and market conditions including in europe the loss of key customers changes in technology or markets significant changes in key personnel or litigation a significant and sustained decrease in share price andor other events including effects from the sale or disposal of a reporting unit some or all of the recorded goodwill or other indefinitelived intangible assets could be subject to impairment and could result in a material adverse effect on snapon’s financial position or results of operations 

snapon completed its annual impairment testing of goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets in the second quarter of 2012 the results of which did not result in any impairment as of 2012 year end the company has no accumulated impairment losses although the company consistently uses the same methods in developing the assumptions and estimates underlying the fair value calculations such estimates are uncertain by nature and can vary from actual results in performing its annual impairment testing the company performed a sensitivity analysis on the material assumptions used in the discounted cash flow valuation models for each of its 11 reporting units based on the company’s second quarter 2012 impairment testing and assuming a hypothetical 10 decrease in the estimated fair values of each of its 11 reporting units the hypothetical fair value of each of the company’s 11 reporting units would have been greater than its carrying value see note 6 to the consolidated financial statements for further information about goodwill and other intangible assets 

impairment of longlived and amortized intangible assets snapon performs impairment evaluations of its longlived assets including property plant and equipment and intangible assets with finite lives whenever business conditions or events indicate that those assets may be impaired when the estimated future undiscounted cash flows to be generated by the assets are less than the carrying value of the longlived assets the assets are written down to fair market value and a charge is recorded to current operations 

significant and unanticipated changes in circumstances such as significant declines in profitability and cash flow due to significant and longterm deterioration in macroeconomic industry and market conditions including in europe the loss of key customers changes in technology or markets andor other events including effects from the sale or disposal of a reporting unit could require a provision for impairment in a future period 

  

 

 

 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued 

 

 

 

  

allowances for doubtful accounts snapon maintains allowances for doubtful accounts to absorb probable losses inherent in its portfolio of receivables the allowances for doubtful accounts represent management’s estimate of the losses inherent in the company’s receivables portfolio based on ongoing assessments and evaluations of collectability and historical loss experience in estimating losses inherent in each of its receivable portfolios trade finance and contract receivables snapon uses historical loss experience rates by portfolio and applies them to a related aging analysis determination of the proper level of allowances by portfolio requires management to exercise significant judgment about the timing frequency and severity of credit losses that could materially affect the provision for credit losses and therefore net income the allowances for doubtful accounts takes into consideration numerous quantitative and qualitative factors by loan type including historical loss experience portfolio duration collection experience delinquency trends economic conditions and credit risk quality as follows 

 

  

  

  

  

 management performs detailed reviews of its receivables on a monthly andor quarterly basis to assess the adequacy of the allowances based on historical and current trends and other factors affecting credit losses and to determine if any impairment has occurred a receivable is impaired when it is probable that all amounts related to the receivable will not be collected according to the contractual terms of the agreement in circumstances where the company is aware of a specific customer’s inability to meet its financial obligations a specific reserve is recorded against amounts due to reduce the net recognized receivable to the amount reasonably expected to be collected additions to the allowances for doubtful accounts are maintained through adjustments to the provision for credit losses which are charged to current period earnings amounts determined to be uncollectable are charged directly against the allowances while amounts recovered on previously chargedoff accounts increase the allowances net chargeoffs include the principal amount of losses chargedoff as well as chargedoff interest and fees recovered interest and fees previously chargedoff are recorded through the allowances for doubtful accounts and increase the allowances finance receivables are assessed for chargeoff when an account becomes 120 days past due and are chargedoff typically within 60 days of asset repossession contract receivables related to equipment leases are generally chargedoff when an account becomes 150 days past due while contract receivables related to franchise finance and van leases are generally chargedoff up to 180 days past the asset return for finance and contract receivables customer bankruptcies are generally chargedoff upon notification that the associated debt is not being reaffirmed or in any event no later than 180 days past due 

snapon does not believe that its trade accounts finance or contract receivables represent significant concentrations of credit risk because of the diversified portfolio of individual customers and geographical areas see note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for further information on allowances for doubtful accounts 

  

 

 

  

 

  

excess and obsolete inventory  snapon records allowances for excess and obsolete inventory based on historical and estimated future demand and market conditions allowances for raw materials are largely based on an analysis of raw material age and actual physical inspection of raw material for fitness for use as part of evaluating the adequacy of allowances for workinprogress and finished goods management reviews individual product stockkeeping units skus by product category and product life cycle cost adjustments for each product categoryproduct lifecycle state are generally established and maintained based on a combination of historical experience forecasted sales and promotions technological obsolescence inventory age and other actual known conditions and circumstances should actual product marketability and raw material fitness for use be affected by conditions that are different from management estimates further adjustments to inventory allowances may be required 

pension benefits the pension benefit obligation and related pension expense are calculated in accordance with us gaap and are impacted by certain actuarial assumptions changes in these assumptions are primarily influenced by factors outside of snapon’s control and can have a significant effect on the amounts reported in the financial statements snapon believes that the two most critical assumptions are i the expected return on plan assets and ii the assumed discount rate 

pension expense increases as the expected rate of return on plan assets decreases lowering the expected rate of return assumption for snapon’s domestic pension plan assets by 50 basis points would have increased snapon’s 2012 domestic pension expense by approximately 37 million snapon uses a threeyear marketrelated value asset method of amortizing the difference between actual and expected returns on its domestic plans’ assets 

the objective of snapon’s discount rate assumption is to reflect the rate at which the pension benefits could be effectively settled in making this determination the company takes into account the timing and amount of benefits that would be available under the plans the discount rate assumption used to determine the december 29 2012 projected benefit obligation was based on a cash flow matching methodology developed by the company’s outside actuaries and which incorporates a review of current economic conditions the methodology for selecting the discount rate as of 2012 year end was to match the plans’ yearly projected benefit cash flows to those of hypothetical bond portfolios using highquality aa rated or better corporate bonds from either moody’s investors service or standard  poor’s credit rating agencies available at the measurement date this technique calculates bond portfolios that produce adequate cash flows to pay the plans’ projected yearly benefits and then selects the portfolio with the highest yield and uses that yield as the recommended discount rate 

the selection of the 43 weightedaverage discount rate for snapon’s domestic pension plans as of 2012 year end represents the single rate that produces the same present value of cash flows as the estimated benefit plan payments lowering snapon’s domestic discount rate assumption by 50 basis points would have increased snapon’s 2012 domestic pension expense and projected benefit obligations by approximately 63 million and 605 million respectively as of 2012 year end snapon’s domestic projected benefit obligation comprised approximately 82 of snapon’s worldwide projected benefit obligation the weightedaverage discount rate for snapon’s foreign pension plans of 41 represents the single rate that produces the same present value of cash flows as the estimated benefit plan payments lowering snapon’s foreign discount rate assumption by 50 basis points would have increased snapon’s 2012 foreign pension expense and projected benefit obligation by approximately 16 million and 216 million respectively 

actuarial gains and losses in excess of 10 percent of the greater of the projected benefit obligation or marketrelated value of assets are amortized on a straightline basis over the average remaining service period of active participants prior service costs resulting from plan amendments are amortized in equal annual amounts over the average remaining service period of affected active participants or over the remaining life expectancy of affected retired participants see note 11 to the consolidated financial statements for further information on pension plans 

postretirement benefits snapon’s postretirement benefits obligation and related expense are calculated in accordance with us gaap and are impacted by certain actuarial assumptions including health care trend rates as of 2012 year end a onepercentagepoint increase in the health care cost trend rate for future years would increase the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation by approximately 13 million and the aggregate of the service cost and interest cost components by 01 million conversely a onepercentagepoint decrease in the health care cost trend rate for future years would decrease the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation by 11 million and the aggregate of the service cost and interest cost components by 01 million see note 12 to the consolidated financial statements for further information on postretirement plans 

  

 

 

 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued 

 

 

 

  

income taxes  snapon records deferred income tax assets and liabilities for differences between the book basis and tax basis of the related net assets snapon records a valuation allowance when appropriate to reduce its deferred tax assets if it is morelikelythannot that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized while the company has considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance if these estimates and assumptions change in the future the company may be required to adjust its valuation allowance this could result in a charge to or an increase in income in the period such determination is made 

in addition the company operates within multiple taxing jurisdictions and is subject to audit in these jurisdictions the company records accruals for the estimated outcomes of these audits and the accruals may change in the future due to new developments in each matter see note 8 to the consolidated financial statements for further information on income taxes 

outlook 

snapon believes that the continued advancement of its strategic framework will provide the opportunity to further capitalize on its defined runways for coherent growth and create longterm value for its shareholders growth opportunities in 2013 will focus on vehicle repair technicians repair shop owners and managers critical industries and emerging markets for vehicle repair technicians the company intends to continue to enhance its mobile tool distribution network by reaching more vehicle repair technicians and improve franchisee productivity profitability satisfaction and commercial health similarly snapon seeks to further expand its presence with repair shop owners and managers through direct and distributor channels within its repair systems  information group with new and expanded product introductions and services the company also expects as part of its coherent growth strategy to continue rolling the snapon brand “out of the garage” providing professional technicians in a diverse crosssection of critical industries with a broad range of productivityenhancing solutions suited to their unique needs snapon also intends to continue investing in emerging markets including the further expansion of its manufacturing capabilities and product offerings in this arena in 2013 our financial services businesses will continue to focus on delivering financial products and services that attract and sustain profitable franchisees and support snapon’s strategies for expanding market coverage and penetration snapon believes that it is wellpositioned to carry out its growth plans and capitalize on positive longterm trends in 2013 however global market and economic conditions could impact the level and timing of resources deployed in pursuit of these strategic initiatives and snapon’s ability to achieve growth will depend on these as well as other factors that could impact the company’s actual results 

in 2013 snapon expects to continue with the advancement of its strategic framework designed to enhance its mobile tool distribution network expand in the vehicle repair garage extend to critical industries and build in emerging markets in pursuit of these initiatives snapon anticipates that capital expenditures in 2013 will be in a range of 70 million to 80 million snapon expects that its full year 2013 effective income tax rate will be comparable to its 2012 rate 

  

 

 

  

 

  




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

market credit and economic risks 

market risk is the potential economic loss that may result from adverse changes in the fair value of financial instruments snapon is exposed to market risk from changes in both foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates snapon monitors its exposure to these risks and attempts to manage the underlying economic exposures through the use of financial instruments such as foreign currency forward contracts interest rate swap agreements and treasury lock agreements snapon does not use derivative instruments for speculative or trading purposes snapon’s broadbased business activities help to reduce the impact that volatility in any particular area or related areas may have on its operating earnings as a whole snapon’s management takes an active role in the risk management process and has developed policies and procedures that require specific administrative and business functions to assist in the identification assessment and control of various risks 

foreign currency risk management 

snapon has significant international operations and is subject to certain risks inherent with foreign operations that include currency fluctuations foreign exchange risk exists to the extent that snapon has payment obligations or receipts denominated in currencies other than the functional currency including intercompany loans denominated in foreign currencies to manage these exposures snapon identifies naturally offsetting positions and then purchases hedging instruments to protect the residual net exposures see note 10 to the consolidated financial statements for information on foreign currency risk management 

interest rate risk management 

snapon aims to control funding costs by managing the exposure created by the differing maturities and interest rate structures of snapon’s assets and liabilities through the use of interest rate swap agreements treasury lock agreements are used from time to time to manage potential changes in interest rates in anticipation of the issuance or sale of certain financial instruments see note 10 to the consolidated financial statements for information on interest rate risk management 

snapon utilizes a valueatrisk “var” model to determine the potential oneday loss in the fair value of its interest rate and foreign exchangesensitive financial instruments from adverse changes in market factors the var model estimates were made assuming normal market conditions and a 95 confidence level snapon’s computations are based on the interrelationships among movements in various currencies and interest rates variancecovariance technique these interrelationships were determined by observing interest rate and foreign currency market changes over the preceding quarter 

the estimated maximum potential oneday loss in fair value calculated using the var model as of 2012 and 2011 year end was 13 million and 23 million respectively on interest ratesensitive financial instruments and 04 million and 06 million respectively on foreign currencysensitive financial instruments the var model is a risk management tool and does not purport to represent actual losses in fair value that will be incurred by snapon nor does it consider the potential effect of favorable changes in market factors 

credit risk 

credit risk is the possibility of loss from a customer’s failure to make payments according to contract terms prior to granting credit each customer is evaluated taking into consideration the borrower’s financial condition collateral debtservicing capacity past payment experience credit bureau information and other financial and qualitative factors that may affect the borrower’s ability to repay credit risk is also monitored regularly through the use of internal proprietary custom scoring models used to evaluate each transaction at the time of the application for credit and by periodically updating those credit scores for ongoing monitoring purposes snapon evaluates credit quality through the use of an internal proprietary measuring system that provides a framework to analyze finance and contract receivables on the basis of risk factors of the individual obligor as well as transaction specific risk loans that have been granted are typically monitored through an asset quality review process that closely monitors past due accounts and initiates a progressive collection action process when appropriate in addition to its direct credit risk exposure snapon also has credit risk exposure for certain socoriginated contracts with recourse provisions related to franchisee van loans sold by soc as of 2012 and 2011 year end 133 million and 139 million respectively of franchisee van loans contain a recourse provision to snapon if the loans become more than 90 days past due 

  

 

 

  

 

  

counterparty risk 

snapon is exposed to credit losses in the event of nonperformance by the counterparties to its various financial agreements including its foreign currency forward contracts and interest rate swap agreements snapon does not obtain collateral or other security to support financial instruments subject to credit risk but monitors the credit standing of the counterparties and generally enters into agreements with financial institution counterparties with a credit rating of a or better snapon does not anticipate nonperformance by its counterparties but cannot provide assurances 

economic risk 

economic risk is the possibility of loss resulting from economic instability in certain areas of the world snapon continually monitors its exposure in these markets 

as a result of the above market credit and economic risks net income and revenues in any particular period may not be representative of fullyear results and may vary significantly from year to year inflation has not had a significant impact on the company 

commodity risk 

snapon is a purchaser of certain commodities such as steel natural gas and electricity the company is also a purchaser of components and parts that are integrated into the company’s end products as well as the purchaser of certain finished goods all of which may contain various commodities including steel aluminum and others snapon’s supply of raw materials and purchased components are generally and readily available from numerous suppliers 

the principal raw material used in the manufacture of the company’s products is steel which the company purchases in competitive pricesensitive markets to meet snapon’s high quality standards the company’s steel needs range from specialized alloys which are available only from a limited group of approved suppliers to commodity types of alloys these raw materials have historically exhibited price and demand cyclicality some of these materials have been and in the future may be in short supply as some steel alloys require specialized manufacturing procedures snapon could experience inventory shortages if it were required to use an alternative manufacturer on short notice additionally unexpected price increases could result in higher prices to snapon’s customers or an erosion of the margins on its products 

snapon believes its ability to sell product is also dependent on the number of vehicles on the road the number of miles driven and the general aging of vehicles these factors affect the frequency type and amount of service and repair performed on vehicles by technicians and therefore affect the demand for the number of technicians the prosperity of the technicians and subsequently the demand the technicians have for the company’s tools other products and services and the value they place on those products and services to the extent that the prices of gasoline and other petroleumbased fuels increase as they have at times in recent years consumers may turn to other methods of transportation including more frequent use of public transportation which could result in a decrease in the use of privately operated vehicles a decrease in the use of privately operated vehicles may lead to fewer repairs and less demand for the company’s products 

to the extent that commodity prices increase and the company does not have firm pricing agreements with its suppliers the company may experience margin declines to the extent that it is not able to increase the selling prices of its products

other 

franchise fee revenue including nominal nonrefundable initial and ongoing monthly fees primarily for sales business training marketing and product promotion programs is recognized as the fees are earned 

sales and distribution 

snapon markets and distributes its products and related services principally to professional tool and equipment users around the world the two largest market sectors are the vehicle service and repair sector and the industrial sector 

vehicle service and repair sector 

the vehicle service and repair sector has three main customer groups i professional technicians who purchase tools equipment and diagnostics products for themselves ii other professional customers related to automotive repair including owners and managers of independent and oem dealership service and repair shops who purchase tools equipment and diagnostics products for use by multiple technicians within a service or repair facility and iii oems 

snapon provides innovative tool equipment and business solutions as well as technical sales support and training to meet technicians’ evolving needs snapon’s mobile tool van distribution system offers technicians the convenience of purchasing quality tools at their place of business with minimal disruption of their work routine snapon also provides owners and managers of shops where technicians work with tools diagnostics equipment repair and service information including electronic parts catalogs and shop management products snapon’s oem facilitation business provides oems with products and services including tools consulting and facilitation services which include product procurement distribution and administrative support to customers for their dealership equipment programs 

major challenges for snapon and the vehicle service and repair sector include the increasing rate of technological change within motor vehicles vehicle population growth vehicle life and the resulting impact on the businesses of both our suppliers and customers that is necessitated by such change snapon believes it is a meaningful participant in the market sector for vehicle service and repair 

industrial sector 

snapon markets its products and services globally to a broad crosssection of commercial and industrial customers including maintenance and repair operations manufacturing and assembly facilities various government agencies facilities and operations including military operations vocational and technical schools aerospace and aviation oem and service and repair customers oil and gas developers mining operations energy and power generation equipment fabricators and operators agriculture infrastructure construction companies and other customers that require instrumentation service tools andor equipment for their product and business needs

major challenges in the industrial sector include a highly competitive costconscious environment and a trend toward customers making many of their tool and equipment purchases through one integrated supplier snapon believes it is a meaningful participant in the market sector for industrial tools and equipment 

  

 

 

  

 

  

distribution channels 

snapon serves customers primarily through the following channels of distribution i the mobile van channel ii company direct sales iii distributors and iv ecommerce the following discussion summarizes snapon’s general approach for each channel and is not intended to be allinclusive 

mobile van channel 

in the united states a significant portion of sales to the vehicle service and repair sector are conducted through snapon’s mobile franchise van channel snapon’s franchisees primarily serve vehicle service technicians and vehicle service shop owners generally providing weekly contact at the customer’s place of business franchisees’ sales are concentrated in hand and power tools tool storage products and shop equipment and diagnostics and repair information products which can easily be transported in a van and demonstrated during a brief sales call franchisees purchase snapon’s products at a discount from suggested list prices and resell them at prices established by the franchisee us franchisees are provided a list of places of business that serves as the basis of the franchisee’s sales route 

snapon also offers an option termed the “gateway program” to potential us franchisees including those that do not meet the standard franchise qualification requirements gateway program participants have less upfront investment and are provided an initial base level of consigned inventory from snapon to assist them in gaining experience and building equity toward the future purchase of a standard franchise snapon also provides certain franchisees the opportunity to add vans to their franchise or to add a limited number of additional franchises snapon charges nominal initial and ongoing monthly franchise fees since 1991 written franchise agreements have been entered into with all new us franchisees and most pre1991 independent franchisees as of 2011 year end there were 3177 vans operated by us franchisees approximately 97 with written franchise agreements or individuals employed by such franchisees as compared with 3159 vans approximately 96 as of 2010 year end 

in addition to its mobile van channel in the united states snapon has replicated its us franchise van distribution model in certain other countries including australia canada germany japan the united kingdom the netherlands south africa new zealand belgium and ireland in many of these markets as in the united states purchase decisions are generally made or influenced by professional vehicle service technicians and shop owners and managers as of 2011 year end snapon’s worldwide mobile van count was approximately 4800 including approximately 3500 vans in the united states 

through soc financing is available to us franchisees including financing for van and truck leases working capital loans and loans to enable new franchisees to fund the purchase of the franchise in many international markets snapon offers a variety of financing options to its franchisees andor customer networks through its whollyowned international finance subsidiaries the decision to finance through snapon or another financing entity is solely at the customer’s election 

snapon supports its franchisees with a field organization of regional offices franchise performance teams diagnostic sales developers “dsds” customer care centers and distribution centers snapon also provides sales and business training and marketing and product promotion programs as well as customer and franchisee financing programs through soc and the company’s international finance subsidiaries all of which are designed to strengthen franchisee sales in north america the united states national franchise advisory council and the canadian national franchise advisory council both of which are composed primarily of franchisees that are elected by franchisees assist snapon in identifying and implementing enhancements to the franchise program 

in the united states franchisees work closely with the dsds the dsds train franchisees on the sale of higherpricepoint diagnostics and demonstrate and sell vehicle service shop management and information systems dsds work independently and with franchisees to identify and generate sales among vehicle service technicians shop owners and managers dsds are snapon employees who are compensated through a combination of base salary and commission a franchisee receives a brokerage fee from certain sales made by the dsds to the franchisee’s customers most products sold through franchisees and the dsds are sold under the snapon bluepoint and sun brand names 

snapon also has a companyowned van program in the united states that is designed to i provide another pool of potential franchisees and field organization personnel ii service customers in select new andor open routes not currently serviced by franchisees and iii allow snapon to pilot new sales and promotional ideas prior to introducing them to franchisees as of 2011 year end companyowned vans comprised approximately 6 of the total us van population snapon may elect to increase or reduce the number of companyowned vans in the future 

  

 

 

  

 

  

company direct sales 

a significant proportion of shop equipment sales in the united states under the john bean and blackhawk brands diagnostic products under the snapon brand and information products under the mitchell 1 brand are made by direct and independent sales forces that have responsibility for national and other accounts as the vehicle service and repair sector consolidates with more business conducted by national chains and franchised service centers snapon believes these larger organizations can be serviced most effectively by sales people who can demonstrate and sell the full line of equipment and diagnostic products and services snapon also sells these products and services directly to oems and their franchised dealers 

snapon brand tools and equipment are marketed to industrial and governmental customers in the united states through both industrial sales representatives who are employees and independent industrial distributors in most markets outside the united states industrial sales are conducted through independent distributors the sales representatives focus on industrial customers whose main purchase criteria are quality and service as of 2011 year end snapon had industrial sales representatives in the united states including puerto rico australia canada japan mexico and some european asian latin american and middle eastern countries with the united states representing the majority of snapon’s total industrial sales 

snapon also sells software services and solutions to the automotive power equipment and sports segments products and services are marketed to targeted groups including oems and their dealerships and individual repair shops to effectively reach oems such as general motors company daimler ag ford motor company chrysler group llc toyota motor corporation john deere deere  company cnh global nv jc bamford excavators ltd jcb and yamaha corporation snapon has deployed focused business teams globally 

distributors 

sales of certain tools and equipment are made through independent distributors who purchase the items from snapon and resell them to end users hand tools under the bahco fish and hook and lindström brands and trade names for example are sold through distributors in europe north and south america asia and certain other parts of the world wheel service and other vehicle service equipment are sold through distributors primarily under brands including hofmann john bean cartec and blackhawk diagnostics and equipment are marketed through distributors in south america and asia and through both a direct sales force and distributors in europe under the snapon sun bahco and bluepoint brands 

ecommerce 

snapon’s ecommerce development initiatives allow snapon to combine the capabilities of the internet with snapon’s existing brand sales and distribution strengths to reach new and underserved customer segments snapon offers current and prospective customers online aroundtheclock access to research and purchase products through its public internet web site at wwwsnaponcom  the site features an online catalog containing nearly 15000 products including snapon hand tools power tools tool storage units and diagnostic equipment available to consumers and professionals in the united states the united kingdom canada and australia as of 2011 year end snapon had more than 730000 registered users including approximately 48000 industrial accounts ecommerce and certain other system enhancement initiatives are designed to improve productivity and further leverage the oneonone relationships and service snapon has with its current and prospective customers through businesstobusiness and businesstoconsumer capabilities snapon and its franchisees are enhancing communications with customers on a realtime 24 hour 7 day a week basis 

competition 

snapon competes on the basis of its product quality and performance product line breadth and depth service brand awareness and imagery and technological innovation while no single company competes with snapon across all of its product lines and distribution channels various companies compete in one or more product categories andor distribution channels 

snapon believes it is a leading manufacturer and distributor of professional tools tool storage diagnostics equipment repair software and solutions offering a broad line of these products to both vehicle service and industrial marketplaces various competitors target and sell to professional technicians in the automotive service and repair sector through the mobile van channel snapon also competes with companies that sell tools and equipment to automotive technicians through retail stores and online auto parts supply outlets and tool supply warehousesdistributorships within the power 

  

 

 

  

 

  

tools category and the industrial sectors snapon has various other competitors including companies with offerings that overlap with other areas discussed herein major competitors selling diagnostics shop equipment and information to automotive dealerships and independent repair shops include oems and their proprietary electronic parts catalog diagnostic and information systems as well as other companies that offer products serving this sector 

raw materials and purchased product 

snapon’s supply of raw materials and purchased components are generally and readily available from numerous suppliers snapon believes it has secured an ample supply of both bar and coil steel for the near future to ensure stable supply to meet material demands the company does not currently anticipate experiencing any significant impact in 2012 from steel pricing or availability issues 

patents trademarks and other intellectual property 

snapon vigorously pursues and relies on patent protection to protect its intellectual property and its position in its markets as of 2011 year end snapon and its subsidiaries held over 700 active and pending patents in the united states and over 1300 active and pending patents outside of the united states sales relating to any single patent did not represent a material portion of snapon’s revenues in any of the last three years 

examples of products that have features or designs that benefit from patent protection include wheel alignment systems wheel balancers tire changers lifts test lanes sealed ratchets electronic torque instruments ratcheting screwdrivers emissionssensing devices and diagnostic equipment 

much of the technology used in the manufacture of vehicle service tools and equipment is in the public domain snapon relies primarily on trade secret protection to protect proprietary processes used in manufacturing methods and processes are patented when appropriate copyright protection is also utilized when appropriate 

trademarks used by snapon are of continuing importance to snapon in the marketplace trademarks have been registered in the united states and more than 100 other countries and additional applications for trademark registrations are pending snapon vigorously polices proper use of its trademarks snapon’s right to manufacture and sell certain products is dependent upon licenses from others however these products under license do not represent a material portion of snapon’s net sales 

domain names have become a valuable corporate asset for companies around the world including snapon domain names often contain a trademark or service mark or even a corporate name and are often considered intellectual property the recognition and value of the snapon name trademark and domain name are core strengths of the company 

snapon strategically licenses the snapon brand to carefully selected manufacturing and distribution companies for items such as apparel work boots lighting and a variety of other goods in order to further build equity and market presence for the company’s strongest brand 

environmental 

snapon is subject to various environmental laws ordinances regulations and other requirements of government authorities in the united states and other nations at snapon these environmental liabilities are managed through the snapon environmental health and safety management system “eh  sms” which is applied worldwide the system is based upon continual improvement and is certified to iso 140012004 and ohsas 180012007 verified through det norske veritas dnv certification inc 

snapon believes that it complies with applicable environmental control requirements in its operations expenditures on environmental matters through eh  sms have not had and snapon does not for the foreseeable future expect them to have a material effect upon snapon’s capital expenditures earnings or competitive position 

employees 

snapon employed approximately 11500 people at the end of january 2012 snapon employed approximately 11300 people at the end of january 2011 

  

 

 

  

 

  

approximately 2900 employees or 25 of snapon’s worldwide workforce are represented by unions andor covered under collective bargaining agreements approximately 1000 employees are covered under agreements expiring in 2012 in recent years snapon has not experienced any significant work slowdowns stoppages or other labor disruptions 

the number of covered union employees whose contracts expire within the next five years approximates 1000 employees in 2012 1050 employees in 2013 and 600 employees in 2014 there are no contracts currently scheduled to expire in 2015 or 2016 

there can be no assurance that future contracts with snapon’s unions will be renegotiated upon terms acceptable to snapon 

working capital 

most of snapon’s businesses are not seasonal and their inventory needs are relatively constant snapon did not have a significant backlog of orders at 2011 year end since july 2009 snapon has been using its working capital to fund in part the growth of the onbook receivables originated by soc 

snapon’s liquidity and capital resources and use of working capital are discussed herein in “part ii item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” 

as of 2011 year end neither snapon nor any of its segments depend on any single customer small group of customers or government for any material part of its revenues prior to july 2009 snapon’s financial services segment depended on cit for more than 10 of its revenues

in evaluating the company careful consideration should be given to the following risk factors in addition to the other information included in this annual report on form 10k including the consolidated financial statements and the related notes each of these risk factors could adversely affect the company’s business operating results cash flows andor financial condition as well as adversely affect the value of an investment in the company’s common stock 

economic conditions and world events could affect our operating results 

we our franchisees and our customers may continue to be adversely affected by challenging economic conditions including conditions that may particularly affect specific regions such as the sovereign debt crisis in europe these conditions may result in reduced consumer and investor confidence instability in the credit and financial markets volatile corporate profits and reduced business as well as consumer spending we our franchisees and our customers and the economy as a whole also may be affected by future world or local events outside our control such as acts of terrorism developments in the war on terrorism conflicts in international situations and natural disasters these factors may affect our results of operations by reducing our sales margins andor net income as a result of a slowdown in customer orders or order cancellations impact the availability of raw materials andor the supply chain and could potentially lead to future impairment of our intangible assets in addition political and social turmoil related to international conflicts and terrorist acts may put pressure on economic conditions abroad unstable political social and economic conditions may make it difficult for our franchisees customers suppliers and us to accurately forecast and plan future business activities if such conditions persist our business financial condition results of operations and cash flow could be negatively affected 

raw material and energy price fluctuations and shortages including steel and various fuel sources could adversely affect the ability to obtain needed manufacturing materials and could adversely affect our results of operations 

the principal raw material used in the manufacture of our products is steel which we purchase in competitive pricesensitive markets to meet snapon’s high quality standards our steel needs range from specialized alloys which are available only from a limited group of approved suppliers to commodity types of alloys these raw materials have historically exhibited price and demand fluctuations of a cyclical nature some of these materials have been and in the future may be in short supply particularly in the event of a general economic recovery mill shut downs or production cut backs as some steel alloys require specialized manufacturing procedures we could experience inventory shortages if we were required to use an alternative manufacturer on short notice additionally unexpected price increases for other raw materials could result in higher prices to our customers or an erosion of the margins on our products 

  

 

 

  

 

  

we believe our ability to sell our products is also dependent on the number of vehicles on the road the number of miles driven and the general aging of vehicles these factors affect the frequency type and amount of service and repair performed on vehicles by technicians and therefore affect the demand for the number of technicians the prosperity of the technicians and subsequently the demand technicians have for our tools other products and services and the value technicians place on those products and services to the extent that the prices of gasoline and other petroleumbased fuels increase as they have at times in recent years consumers may turn to other methods of transportation including more frequent use of public transportation which could result in a decrease in the use of privately operated vehicles a decrease in the use of privately operated vehicles may lead to fewer repairs and less demand for our products 

we use various energy sources to transport produce and distribute products and some of our products have components that are petroleum based petroleum and energy prices have periodically increased significantly over short periods of time further volatility and changes may be caused by market fluctuations supply and demand currency fluctuation production and transportation disruption world events and changes in governmental programs energy price increases raise both our operating costs and the costs of our materials and we may not be able to increase our prices enough to offset these costs higher prices also may reduce the level of future customer orders and our profitability 

exposure to credit risks of customers and resellers may make it difficult to collect receivables and could adversely affect operating results and financial condition 

industry and economic conditions have the potential to weaken the financial position of some of our customers if circumstances surrounding our customers’ ability to repay their credit obligations were to deteriorate and result in the writedown or writeoff of such receivables it would negatively affect our operating results for the period in which they occur and if large could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flow 

regulatory changes related to financial services operations could adversely affect operating results and financial condition 

financial services businesses of all kinds are subject to increasing regulation in addition to potentially increasing the costs of doing business new laws and regulations or changes to existing laws and regulations as well as the enforcement thereof may affect the relationships between creditors and debtors inhibit the rights of creditors to collect amounts owed to them or limit the types of financial products or services offered any or all of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flow 

new and stricter legislation and regulations may affect our business and results of operations 

increased legislative and regulatory activity and burdens and a more stringent manner in which they are applied particularly in the united states could significantly impact our business and the economy as a whole for example the affordable care act “act” which was enacted in march 2010 and is being phased in over the next several years significantly affects the provision of both health care services and benefits in the united states this act may impact our cost of providing our employees and retirees with health insurance andor benefits and may also impact various other aspects of our business also the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act of 2010 may affect among other matters our financial services businesses by requiring changes in the way in which we provide credit or by otherwise increasing the expenses of that operation as well as the costs related to corporate governance sourcing compliance disclosures and general securities law compliance 

these developments and other potential future legislation and regulations as well as the increasingly strict regulatory environment may also adversely affect the customers to which and the markets into which we sell our products and increase our costs and otherwise negatively affect our business financial condition or results of operations including in ways that cannot yet be foreseen 

the performance of snapon’s mobile van tool distribution business depends on the success of its franchisees 

approximately 39 of our 2011 revenues were generated by the snapon tools group which consists of snapon’s business operations serving the worldwide van channel except in limited circumstances each of our mobile tool vans is operated by a franchisee pursuant to a franchise agreement snapon’s success is dependent on its relationships with franchisees individually and collectively as they are the primary sales and service link between the company and vehicle service and repair technicians who are an important class of end users for snapon’s products and services if our franchisees are not successful or if we do not maintain an effective relationship with our franchisees the delivery of products the collection of receivables andor our relationship with end users could be adversely affected and thereby negatively impact our business financial condition results of operations and cash flow 

  

 

 

  

 

  

in addition if we are unable to maintain effective relationships with franchisees snapon or the franchisees may choose to terminate the relationship which may result in i open routes in which enduser customers are not provided reliable service ii litigation resulting from termination iii reduced collections or increased writeoffs of franchisee receivables owed to snapon andor iv reduced collections or increased writeoffs of extended credit contracts and to a lesser extent lease contracts that are collected by franchisees on behalf of soc as snapon has approximately 4800 vans worldwide the majority of which are operated by franchisees or individuals employed by franchisees and are governed by contracts litigation can result from the termination of these relationships 

instability and uncertainty in the credit and financial markets could adversely impact the availability of credit that we and our customers need to operate our businesses 

we depend upon the availability of credit to operate our business including the financing of receivables from enduser customers that are originated by soc our enduser customers franchisees and suppliers also require access to credit for their businesses instability and uncertainty in the credit and financial markets could adversely impact the availability of future financing and the terms on which it might be available to snapon its enduser customers franchisees and suppliers inability to access credit markets or a deterioration in the terms on which financing might be available could have an adverse impact on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flow 

increasing our financial leverage could affect our operations and profitability 

in recent years we have increased our use of borrowed funds primarily to fund the receivables of soc the company’s increased leverage may affect both our availability of additional capital resources in the future as well as our operations in several ways including 

 

     while we believe we will have the ability to service our debt and obtain additional resources in the future if and when needed that will depend upon our results of operations and financial position at the time the thencurrent state of the credit and financial markets and other factors that may be beyond our control therefore we cannot give assurances that credit will be available on terms that we consider attractive or at all if and when necessary or beneficial to us 

failure to achieve expected investment returns on pension plan assets as well as changes in interest rates could adversely impact our results of operations financial position and cash flow 

snapon sponsors various defined benefit pension plans “pension plans” the assets of the pension plans are broadly diversified in an attempt to mitigate the risk of a large loss the assets are invested in equity securities fixed income securities real estate and other real assets other alternative investments and cash required funding for the company’s domestic defined benefit pension plans is determined in accordance with guidelines set forth in the federal employee retirement income security act erisa foreign defined benefit pension plans are funded in accordance with local statutes or practice additional contributions to enhance the funded status of the pension plans can be made at the company’s discretion however there can be no assurance that the value of the pension plan assets or the investment returns on those plan assets will be sufficient to meet the future benefit obligations of such plans in addition during periods of adverse investment market conditions and declining interest rates the company may be required to make additional cash contributions to the plans that could reduce our financial flexibility 

our pension plan obligations are affected by changes in market interest rates significant fluctuations in market interest rates have added and may further add volatility to our pension plan obligations in recent years declining market interest rates have increased our pension plan obligations if market interest rates continue to decline our pension plan obligations will increase while our plan assets are broadly diversified there are inherent market risks associated with investments if adverse market conditions occur our plan assets could incur significant or material losses since we may need to make additional contributions to address an increase in obligations andor a loss in plan assets the combination of declining market interest rates andor past or future plan asset investment losses could adversely impact our financial position results of operations and cash flow 

  

 

 

  

 

  

the company’s pension plan expense is comprised of the following factors i service cost ii interest on projected benefit obligations iii the expected return on plan assets iv the amortization of prior service costs and v the effects of actuarial gains and losses the accounting for pensions involves the estimation of a number of factors that are highly uncertain certain factors such as the interest cost and the expected return on plan assets are impacted by changes in market interest rates and the value of plan assets a significant decrease in market interest rates and a decrease in the fair value of plan assets would increase net pension expense and may adversely affect the company’s future results of operations see note 11 to the consolidated financial statements for further information on the company’s pension plans 

our inability to provide acceptable financing alternatives to enduser customers and franchisees could adversely impact our operating results 

an integral component of our business and profitability is our ability to offer competitive financing alternatives to enduser customers and franchisees since july 2009 snapon has been providing the resources for the majority of this financing at soc as a result we are more dependent upon our ability to obtain capital resources or other financing on terms that we believe are attractive to support soc’s onbook receivables the lack of our ability to obtain capital resources or financing whether resulting from the state of the financial markets our own operating performance or other factors would negatively affect our operating results and financial condition adverse fluctuations in interest rates andor our ability to provide competitive financing programs for other reasons could also have an adverse impact on our revenue and profitability 

the steps taken to restructure operations rationalize operating footprint lower operating expenses and achieve greater efficiencies in the supply chain could disrupt business 

we have taken steps in the past and expect to take additional steps in 2012 intended to improve customer service and to drive further efficiencies and reduce costs some of which could be disruptive to our business these actions collectively across our operating groups are focused on the following 

 

       we believe that by executing on these focus areas along with a continued commitment to new innovative products and rci initiatives to drive higher levels of productivity and lower costs the company and its franchisees may realize stronger growth and profitability however failure to succeed in the implementation of any or all of these actions could result in an inability to achieve our financial goals and could be disruptive to the business 

in addition future reductions to headcount and other cost reduction measures may result in the loss of technical expertise that could adversely affect our research and development efforts and ability to meet product development schedules efforts to reduce components of expense could result in the recording of charges for inventory and technologyrelated writeoffs workforce reduction costs or other charges relating to the consolidation or closure of facilities if we were to incur a substantial charge to further these efforts our earnings per share would be adversely affected in such period if we are unable to effectively manage our cost reduction and restructuring efforts our business financial condition results of operations and cash flow could be negatively affected 

  

 

 

  

 

  

failure to maintain effective distribution of products and services could adversely impact revenue gross margin and profitability 

we use a variety of distribution methods to sell our products and services successfully managing the interaction of our distribution efforts to reach various potential customer segments for our products and services is a complex process moreover since each distribution method has distinct risks costs and gross margins our failure to implement the most advantageous balance in the delivery model for our products and services could adversely affect our revenue and gross margins and therefore our profitability 

risks associated with the disruption of manufacturing operations could adversely affect profitability or competitive position 

we manufacture a significant portion of the products we sell any prolonged disruption in the operations of our existing manufacturing facilities whether due to technical or labor difficulties facility consolidation or closure actions lack of raw material or component availability destruction of or damage to any facility as a result of natural disasters use and storage of hazardous materials or other events or other reasons could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flow 

the inability to continue to introduce new products that respond to customer needs and achieve market acceptance could result in lower revenues and reduced profitability 

sales from new products represent a significant portion of our net sales and are expected to continue to represent a significant component of our future net sales we may not be able to compete effectively unless we continue to enhance existing products or introduce new products to the marketplace in a timely manner product improvements and new product introductions require significant financial and other resources including significant planning design development and testing at the technological product and manufacturing process levels our competitors’ new products may beat our products to market be more effective with more features be less expensive than our products andor render our products obsolete any new products that we develop may not receive market acceptance or otherwise generate any meaningful net sales or profits for us relative to our expectations based on among other things existing and anticipated investments in manufacturing capacity and commitments to fund advertising marketing promotional programs and research and development 

the global tool equipment and diagnostics and repair information industries are competitive 

we face strong competition in all of our market segments price competition in our various industries is intense and pricing pressures from competitors and customers are increasing in general as a manufacturer and marketer of premium products and services the expectations of snapon’s customers and its franchisees are high and increasing any inability to maintain customer satisfaction could diminish snapon’s premium image and reputation and could result in a lessening of its ability to command premium pricing we expect that the level of competition will remain high in the future which could limit our ability to maintain or increase market share or profitability 

product liability claims and litigation could affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flow 

the products that we design andor manufacture can lead to product liability claims being filed against us to the extent that plaintiffs are successful in showing that defects in the design or manufacture of our products led to personal injury or property damage we may be subject to claims for damages although we are insured for damages above a certain amount we bear the costs and expenses associated with defending claims including frivolous lawsuits and are responsible for damages below the insurance retention amount as a manufacturer we can be subject to the costs and potential negative publicity of product recalls which could impact our results 

information technology infrastructure and security are critical to supporting business objectives failure of our information technology infrastructure to operate effectively could adversely affect our business 

we depend heavily on information technology infrastructure to achieve our business objectives if a problem occurs that impairs or compromises this infrastructure including due to security breaches or malicious attacks or during systems upgrades andor new systems implementations the resulting disruption could impede our ability to record or process orders manufacture and ship in a timely manner protect sensitive data of the company our customers our suppliers and business partners or otherwise carry on business in the normal course any such events could cause us to lose customers andor revenue and could require us to incur significant expense to remediate including as a result of legal claims or proceedings 

  

 

 

  

 

  

in association with initiatives to better integrate business units rationalize operating footprint and improve responsiveness to franchisees and customers snapon is continually replacing and enhancing its existing global enterprise resource planning erp management information systems as we integrate implement and deploy new information technology processes and a common information infrastructure across our global operations we could experience disruptions in our business that could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flow 

the recognition of impairment charges on goodwill or other intangible assets would adversely impact our future financial position and results of operations 

we have a substantial amount of goodwill and purchased intangible assets almost all of which are booked in the commercial  industrial and repair systems  information groups we are required to perform impairment tests on our goodwill and other intangibles annually or at any time when events occur that could impact the value of our business segments our determination of whether impairment has occurred is based on a comparison of each of our reporting units’ fair market value with its carrying value significant and unanticipated changes in circumstances such as significant and longterm adverse changes in business climate including in europe adverse actions by regulators unanticipated competition loss of key customers including large customers associated with the automotive industry andor changes in technology or markets could require a provision for impairment in a future period that could substantially impact our reported earnings and reduce our consolidated net worth and shareholders’ equity should the economic environment in these markets deteriorate our results of operations and financial position could be materially impacted including as a result of the effects of potential impairment writedowns of goodwill andor other intangible assets related to these businesses 

failure to adequately protect intellectual property could adversely affect our business 

intellectual property rights are an important and integral component of our business we attempt to protect our intellectual property rights through a combination of patent trademark copyright and trade secret laws as well as licensing agreements and thirdparty nondisclosure and assignment agreements adverse determinations in a judicial or administrative proceeding could prevent us from manufacturing and selling our products or prevent us from stopping others from manufacturing and selling competing products failure to obtain or maintain adequate protection of our intellectual property rights for any reason could have a material adverse effect on our business 

foreign operations are subject to currency exchange political economic and other risks that could adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flow 

the reporting currency for snapon’s consolidated financial statements is the us dollar certain of the company’s assets liabilities expenses and revenues are denominated in currencies other than the us dollar in preparing snapon’s consolidated financial statements those assets liabilities expenses and revenues are translated into us dollars at applicable exchange rates increases or decreases in exchange rates between the us dollar and those other currencies affect the us dollar value of those items as reflected in snapon’s consolidated financial statements substantial fluctuations in the value of the us dollar could have a significant impact on the company’s financial condition and results of operations 

approximately 41 of our revenues in 2011 were generated outside of the united states future growth rates and success of our business depends in large part on continued growth in our nonus operations including growth in emerging markets and critical industries numerous risks and uncertainties affect our nonus operations these risks and uncertainties include political economic and social instability such as acts of war civil disturbance or acts of terrorism local labor conditions changes in government policies and regulations including imposition or increases in withholding and other taxes on remittances and other payments by international subsidiaries currency instability transportation delays or interruptions sovereign debt uncertainties and difficulties in enforcement of contract and intellectual property rights should the economic environment in our nonus markets deteriorate from current levels including as a result of the effects of potential impairment writedowns of goodwill andor other intangible assets related to these businesses our results of operations and financial position could be materially impacted 

we are also affected by changes in inflation rates and interest rates additionally cash generated in nonus jurisdictions may be difficult to repatriate to the united states in a taxefficient manner our foreign operations are also subject to other risks and challenges such as the need to staff and manage diverse workforces respond to the needs of multiple national and international marketplaces and differing business climates and cultures in various countries 

  

 

 

  

 

  

our operations expose us to the risk of environmental liabilities costs litigation and violations that could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and reputation 

certain of our operations are subject to environmental laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which they operate which impose limitations on the discharge of pollutants into the ground air and water and establish standards for the generation treatment use storage and disposal of hazardous wastes we must also comply with various health and safety regulations in the united states and abroad in connection with our operations failure to comply with any of these laws could result in civil and criminal monetary and nonmonetary penalties and damage to our reputation in addition we may incur costs related to remedial efforts or alleged environmental damage associated with past or current waste disposal practices legislation has been proposed and governmental regulatory action has been both proposed and taken that may significantly impact environmental compliance in the united states these actions could increase our costs of production by raising the cost of energy as well as by further restricting emissions or other processes that we currently use in our operations we cannot provide assurance that our costs of complying with current or future environmental protection and health and safety laws will not exceed our estimates 

legal disputes could adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flow 

from time to time we are subject to legal disputes that are being litigated andor settled in the ordinary course of business disputes or future lawsuits could result in the diversion of management’s time and attention away from business operations additionally negative developments with respect to legal disputes and the costs incurred in defending ourselves could have an adverse impact on the company adverse outcomes or settlements could also require us to pay damages potentially in excess of amounts reserved or incur liability for other remedies that could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flow 

the inability to successfully defend claims from taxing authorities could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flow 

we conduct business in many countries which requires us to interpret the income tax laws and rulings in each of those taxing jurisdictions due to the subjectivity of tax laws between those jurisdictions as well as the subjectivity of factual interpretations our estimates of income tax liabilities may differ from actual payments or assessments claims from taxing authorities related to these differences could have an adverse impact on our financial condition results of operations and cash flow 

failure to attract and retain qualified personnel could lead to a loss of revenue andor profitability 

snapon’s success depends in part on the efforts and abilities of its senior management team and other key employees their skills experience and industry contacts significantly benefit our operations and administration the failure to attract and retain members of our senior management team and other key employees could have a negative effect on our operating results in addition transitions of important responsibilities to new individuals inherently include the possibility of disruptions to our business and operations which could negatively affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flow 

we may not successfully integrate businesses we acquire which could have an adverse impact on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flow 

the pursuit of future growth through acquisitions including participation in joint ventures involves significant risks that could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flow these risks include

revenue recognition snapon recognizes revenue from the sale of tools diagnostics and equipment solutions when contract terms are met the price is fixed or determinable collectability is reasonably assured and a product is shipped or risk of ownership has been transferred to and accepted by the customer for sales contingent upon customer acceptance revenue recognition is deferred until such obligations are fulfilled estimated product returns are recorded as a reduction in reported revenues at the time of sale based upon historical product return experience and gross profit margin adjusted for known trends provisions for customer volume rebates discounts and allowances are also recorded as a reduction of reported revenues at the time of sale based on historical experience and known trends revenue related to maintenance and subscription agreements is recognized over the terms of the respective agreements 

snapon also recognizes revenue related to multiple element arrangements including sales of hardware software and softwarerelated services when a sales arrangement contains multiple elements such as hardware and software products andor services snapon uses the relative selling price method for hardware and related software elements that are essential to the hardware’s functionality for software elements that are not essential to the hardware’s functionality and related software postcontract customer support vendor specific objective evidence “vsoe” of fair value is used to allocate revenue to each element based on its relative fair value and when necessary uses the residual method to assign value to the delivered elements when vsoe only exists for the undelivered elements the amount assigned to future

delivery of products or services is recognized when the product is delivered andor when the services are performed in instances where the product andor services are performed over an extended period as is the case with subscription agreements or the providing of ongoing support revenue is generally recognized on a straightline basis over the term of the agreement which generally ranges from 12 to 60 months 

franchise fee revenue including nominal nonrefundable initial and ongoing monthly fees primarily for sales and business training and marketing and product promotion programs is recognized as the fees are earned 

financial services revenue snapon also generates revenue from various financing programs that include i loans to franchisees’ customers and snapon’s industrial and other customers for the purchase or lease of tools equipment and diagnostics products on an extended term payment plan and ii business loans and vehicle leases to franchisees these financing programs are offered through snapon’s whollyowned finance subsidiaries financial services revenue consists of finance loan receivable revenue installment contract revenue and servicing fee income received from cit for periods prior to july 16 2009 financial services revenue also included gains from soc’s sales of originated contracts to cit the decision to finance through snapon or another financing entity is solely at the election of the customer when assessing customers for potential financing snapon considers various factors regarding ability to pay including customers’ financial condition collateral debtservicing ability past payment experience and credit bureau information for finance and contract receivables snapon assesses these factors through the use of credit quality indicators consisting primarily of consumer credit risk scores combined with internal credit risk grades collection experience and other internal metrics 

prior to july 2009 soc substantially sold all of its loan originations to cit on a limited recourse basis soc retained the right to service such loans for a contractual servicing fee contractual servicing fees were 23 million in 2011 49 million in 2010 and 83 million in 2009 

snapon’s international finance subsidiaries own the loans originated through their financing programs loans originated by soc subsequent to july 2009 and loans retained by soc prior to july 2009 are also owned by snapon revenue from interest income on the onbook financing portfolio is recognized over the life of the contracts with interest computed on the average daily balances of the underlying contracts 

impairment of goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets  goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets are tested for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the assets might be impaired annual impairment tests are performed by the company in the second quarter of each year 

snapon evaluates the recoverability of goodwill by estimating the future discounted cash flows of the businesses to which the goodwill relates estimated cash flows and related goodwill are grouped at the reporting unit level the company has determined that its reporting units for testing goodwill impairment are its operating segments or components of an operating segment that constitute a business for which discrete financial information is available and for which segment management regularly reviews the operating results within its four reportable operating segments the company has identified 11 reporting units 

snapon evaluates the recoverability of goodwill by utilizing an income approach that estimates the fair value of the future discounted cash flows of the reporting units to which the goodwill relates the future projections which are based on both past performance and the projections and assumptions used in the company’s operating plans are subject to change as a result of changing economic and competitive conditions this approach reflects management’s internal outlook for the reporting units which management believes provides the best determination of value due to management’s insight and experience with the reporting unit significant estimates used by management in the discounted cash flows methodology include estimates of future cash flows based on expected growth rates price increases working capital levels expected rci benefits and a weightedaverage cost of capital that reflects the specific risk profile of the reporting unit being tested the company’s methodologies for valuing goodwill are applied consistently on a yearoveryear basis the assumptions used in performing the second quarter 2011 impairment calculations were evaluated in light of current market and business conditions snapon continues to believe that the future discounted cash flow valuation model provides the most reasonable and meaningful fair value estimate based upon the reporting units’ projections of future operating results and cash flows and replicates how market participants would value the company’s reporting units in an orderly transaction 

  

 

 

  

 

  

in the event the fair value of a reporting unit is less than the carrying value including goodwill the company would then perform an additional assessment that would compare the implied fair value of goodwill with the carrying amount of goodwill the determination of implied fair value of goodwill would require management to compare the estimated fair value of the reporting unit to the estimated fair value of the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit if necessary the company may consult with valuation specialists to assist with the assessment of the estimated fair value of the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit if the implied fair value of the goodwill is less than the carrying value an impairment loss would be recorded 

snapon also evaluates the recoverability of its indefinitelived trademarks by utilizing an income approach that estimates the fair value of the future discounted cash flows of each of its trademarks the future projections which are based on both past performance and the projections and assumptions used in the company’s operating plans are subject to change as a result of changing economic and competitive conditions significant estimates used by management in the discounted cash flows methodology include estimates of future cash flows based on expected growth and royalty rates expected synergies and a weightedaverage cost of equity that reflects the specific risk profile of the trademark being tested the company’s methodologies for valuing trademarks are applied consistently on a yearoveryear basis the assumptions used in performing the second quarter 2011 impairment calculations were evaluated in light of current market and business conditions snapon continues to believe that the future discounted cash flow valuation model provides the most reasonable and meaningful fair value estimate based upon the trademarks’ projected future cash flows and replicates how market participants would value the company’s trademarks in an orderly transaction 

snapon did not recognize any impairment on its goodwill or other indefinitelived intangible assets in 2011 2010 or 2009 inherent in fair value determinations are significant judgments and estimates including material assumptions about future revenue profitability and cash flows the company’s operational plans and its interpretation of current economic indicators should the operations of the businesses with which goodwill or other indefinitelived intangible assets are associated incur significant declines in profitability and cash flow due to significant and longterm adverse changes in business climate including in europe adverse actions by regulators unanticipated competition loss of key customers andor changes in technology or markets some or all of the recorded goodwill or other indefinitelived intangible assets could be subject to impairment and could result in a material adverse effect on snapon’s financial position or results of operations 

snapon completed its annual impairment testing of goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets in the second quarter of 2011 the results of which did not result in any impairment although the company consistently uses the same methods in developing the assumptions and estimates underlying the fair value calculations such estimates are uncertain by nature and can vary from actual results in performing its annual impairment testing the company performed a sensitivity analysis on the material assumptions used in the discounted cash flow valuation models for each of its 11 reporting units based on the company’s second quarter 2011 impairment testing and assuming a hypothetical 10 decrease in the estimated fair values of each of its 11 reporting units the hypothetical fair value of each of the company’s 11 reporting units would have been greater than its carrying value see note 6 to the consolidated financial statements for further information about goodwill and other intangible assets 

impairment of longlived and amortized intangible assets snapon performs impairment evaluations of its longlived assets including property plant and equipment and intangible assets with finite lives whenever business conditions or events indicate that those assets may be impaired when the estimated future undiscounted cash flows to be generated by the assets are less than the carrying value of the longlived assets the assets are written down to fair market value and a charge is recorded to current operations 

significant and unanticipated changes in circumstances such as significant and longterm adverse changes in business climate including in europe adverse actions by regulators unanticipated competition loss of key customers andor changes in technology or markets could require a provision for impairment in a future period 

  

 

 

 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued 

 

 

 

  

allowances for doubtful accounts snapon maintains allowances for doubtful accounts to absorb probable losses inherent in its portfolio of receivables the allowances for doubtful accounts represent management’s estimate of the losses inherent in the company’s receivables portfolio based on ongoing assessments and evaluations of collectability and historical loss experience in estimating losses inherent in each of its receivable portfolios trade finance and contract receivables snapon uses historical loss experience rates by portfolio and applies them to a related aging analysis determination of the proper level of allowances by portfolio requires management to exercise significant judgment about the timing frequency and severity of credit losses that could materially affect the provision for credit losses and therefore net income the allowances for doubtful accounts takes into consideration numerous quantitative and qualitative factors by loan type including historical loss experience portfolio duration collection experience delinquency trends economic conditions and credit risk quality as follows 

 

  

  

  

  

 management performs detailed reviews of its receivables on a monthly andor quarterly basis to assess the adequacy of the allowances based on historical and current trends and other factors affecting credit losses and to determine if any impairment has occurred a receivable is impaired when it is probable that all amounts related to the receivable will not be collected according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement in circumstances where the company is aware of a specific customer’s inability to meet its financial obligations a specific reserve is recorded against amounts due to reduce the net recognized receivable to the amount reasonably expected to be collected additions to the allowances for doubtful accounts are maintained through adjustments to the provision for credit losses which are charged to current period earnings amounts determined to be uncollectable are charged directly against the allowances while amounts recovered on previously chargedoff accounts increase the allowances net chargeoffs include the principal amount of losses charged off as well as chargedoff interest and fees recovered interest and fees previously chargedoff are recorded through the allowances for doubtful accounts finance receivables are assessed for chargeoff when an account becomes 120 days past due and are chargedoff typically within 60 days of asset repossession contract receivables related to equipment leases are generally chargedoff when an account becomes 150 days past due while contract receivables related to franchise finance and van leases are generally charged off up to 180 days past the asset return for finance and contract receivables customer bankruptcies are generally chargedoff upon notification that the associated debt is not being reaffirmed or in any event no later than 180 days past due 

snapon does not believe that trade accounts finance or contract receivables represent significant concentrations of credit risk because of the diversified portfolio of individual customers and geographical areas see note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for further information on allowances for doubtful accounts 

  

 

 

  

 

  

excess and obsolete inventory  snapon records allowances for excess and obsolete inventory based on historical and estimated future demand and market conditions allowances for raw materials are largely based on an analysis of raw material age and actual physical inspection of raw material for fitness for use as part of evaluating the adequacy of allowances for workinprogress and finished goods management reviews individual product stockkeeping units skus by product category and product life cycle cost adjustments for each product categoryproduct lifecycle state are generally established and maintained based on a combination of historical experience forecasted sales and promotions technological obsolescence inventory age and other actual known conditions and circumstances should actual product marketability and raw material fitness for use be affected by conditions that are different from management estimates further adjustments to inventory allowances may be required 

pension benefits the pension benefit obligation and related pension expense are calculated in accordance with us gaap and are impacted by certain actuarial assumptions changes in these assumptions are primarily influenced by factors outside of snapon’s control and can have a significant effect on the amounts reported in the financial statements snapon believes that the two most critical assumptions are i the expected return on plan assets and ii the assumed discount rate 

pension expense increases as the expected rate of return on plan assets decreases lowering the expected rate of return assumption for snapon’s domestic pension plan assets by 50 basis points would have increased snapon’s 2011 domestic pension expense by approximately 32 million snapon uses a threeyear marketrelated value asset method of amortizing the difference between actual and expected returns on its domestic plan assets 

the objective of snapon’s discount rate assumption is to reflect the rate at which the pension benefits could be effectively settled in making this determination the company takes into account the timing and amount of benefits that would be available under the plans the methodology for selecting the discount rate as of 2011 and 2010 year end was to match the plan’s cash flows to that of a theoretical bond portfolio yield curve that provides the equivalent yields on zerocoupon bonds with an aa rating or better for each maturity the selection of the 45 weightedaverage discount rate for snapon’s domestic pension plans represents the single rate that produces the same present value of cash flows as the estimated benefit plan payments lowering snapon’s domestic discount rate assumption by 50 basis points would have increased snapon’s 2011 domestic pension expense and projected benefit obligation by approximately 52 million and 574 million respectively at 2011 year end snapon’s domestic projected benefit obligation comprised approximately 83 of snapon’s worldwide projected benefit obligation the weightedaverage discount rate for snapon’s foreign pension plans of 47 represents the single rate that produces the same present value of cash flows as the estimated benefit plan payments lowering snapon’s foreign discount rate assumption by 50 basis points would have increased snapon’s 2011 foreign pension expense and projected benefit obligation by approximately 17 million and 184 million respectively 

actuarial gains and losses in excess of 10 percent of the greater of the projected benefit obligation or marketrelated value of assets are amortized on a straightline basis over the average remaining service period of active participants prior service costs resulting from plan amendments are amortized in equal annual amounts over the average remaining service period of affected active participants or over the remaining life expectancy of affected retired participants see note 11 to the consolidated financial statements for further information on pension plans 

postretirement benefits snapon’s postretirement benefits obligation and related expense are calculated in accordance with us gaap and are impacted by certain actuarial assumptions including health care trend rates as of 2011 year end an increase of one percentage point in health care costs would increase the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation by 17 million and the combined annual service and interest cost by 01 million a corresponding decrease of one percentage point would decrease the accumulated postretirement benefit by 15 million and the combined annual service and interest cost by 01 million see note 12 to the consolidated financial statements for further information on postretirement plans 

income taxes  snapon records deferred income tax assets and liabilities for differences between the book basis and tax basis of the related net assets snapon records a valuation allowance when appropriate to reduce its deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized while the company has considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance if these estimates and assumptions change in the future the company may be required to adjust its valuation allowance this could result in a charge to or an increase in income in the period such determination is made 

  

 

 

 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued 

 

 

 

  

in addition the company operates within multiple taxing jurisdictions and is subject to audit in these jurisdictions the company records accruals for the estimated outcomes of these audits and the accruals may change in the future due to new developments in each matter see note 8 to the consolidated financial statements for further information on income taxes 

outlook 

snapon believes that continued advancement of its strategic framework will provide the opportunity to further capitalize on its defined runways for coherent growth and create longterm value for its shareholders specific opportunities for growth in 2012 include the areas of vehicle repair critical industries and emerging markets in vehicle repair the company intends to continue to enhance its mobile tool distribution network by reaching more vehicle repair technicians similarly snapon seeks to further penetrate another key customer group within vehicle repair – shop owners and managers – through direct and distributor channels within its repair systems  information group the company also expects as part of its coherent growth strategy to continue rolling the snapon ® brand “out of the garage” providing professional technicians in a diverse crosssection of critical industries with a broad range of productivity solutions suited to their unique needs in addition snapon intends to continue investing in emerging markets including the further expansion of its manufacturing capacity and product offerings in this arena however global market and economic conditions in 2012 may impact the level and timing of resources deployed in pursuit of these strategic initiatives and snapon’s ability to achieve growth will depend on these as well as other factors that impact the company’s actual results 

in pursuit of these strategic initiatives snapon anticipates that capital expenditures in 2012 will be in a range of 60 million to 70 million restructuring expenses in 2012 will include an estimated 6 million to 8 million charge in the second quarter of 2012 associated with the settlement of a pension plan related to the 2011 closure of the newmarket canada facility pension expense in 2012 exclusive of this charge is expected to be comparable with 2011 levels snapon anticipates that its full year 2012 effective income tax rate will approximate 335 

  

 

 

  

 

  




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

market credit and economic risks 

market risk is the potential economic loss that may result from adverse changes in the fair value of financial instruments snapon is exposed to market risk from changes in both foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates snapon monitors its exposure to these risks and attempts to manage the underlying economic exposures through the use of financial instruments such as foreign currency forward contracts interest rate swap agreements and treasury lock agreements snapon does not use derivative instruments for speculative or trading purposes snapon’s broadbased business activities help to reduce the impact that volatility in any particular area or related areas may have on its operating earnings as a whole snapon’s management takes an active role in the risk management process and has developed policies and procedures that require specific administrative and business functions to assist in the identification assessment and control of various risks 

foreign currency risk management 

snapon has significant international operations and is subject to certain risks inherent with foreign operations that include currency fluctuations and restrictions on movement of funds foreign exchange risk exists to the extent that snapon has payment obligations or receipts denominated in currencies other than the functional currency to manage these exposures snapon identifies naturally offsetting positions and then purchases hedging instruments to protect the residual net exposures see note 10 to the consolidated financial statements for information on foreign currency risk management 

interest rate risk management 

snapon aims to control funding costs by managing the exposure created by the differing maturities and interest rate structures of snapon’s assets and liabilities through the use of interest rate swap agreements treasury lock agreements are used to manage potential changes in interest rates in anticipation of the issuance or sale of certain financial instruments see note 10 to the consolidated financial statements for information on interest rate risk management 

snapon utilizes a valueatrisk “var” model to determine the potential oneday loss in the fair value of its interest rate and foreign exchangesensitive financial instruments from adverse changes in market factors the var model estimates were made assuming normal market conditions and a 95 confidence level snapon’s computations are based on the interrelationships among movements in various currencies and interest rates variancecovariance technique these interrelationships were determined by observing interest rate and foreign currency market changes over the preceding quarter 

the estimated maximum potential oneday loss in fair value calculated using the var model as of 2011 year end was 23 million on interest ratesensitive financial instruments and 06 million on foreign currencysensitive financial instruments the var model is a risk management tool and does not purport to represent actual losses in fair value that will be incurred by snapon nor does it consider the potential effect of favorable changes in market factors 

credit risk 

credit risk is the possibility of loss from a customer’s failure to make payments according to contract terms prior to granting credit each customer is evaluated taking into consideration the borrower’s financial condition collateral debtservicing capacity past payment experience credit bureau information and other financial and qualitative factors that may affect the borrower’s ability to repay credit risk is also monitored regularly through the use of internal proprietary custom scoring models used to evaluate each transaction at the time of the application for credit and by periodically updating those credit scores for ongoing monitoring purposes snapon evaluates credit quality through the use of an internal proprietary measuring system that provides a framework to analyze finance and contract receivables on the basis of risk factors of the individual obligor as well as transaction specific risk loans that have been granted are typically monitored through an asset quality review process that closely monitors past due accounts and initiates a progressive collection action process when appropriate in addition to its direct credit risk exposure snapon also has credit risk exposure for certain socoriginated contracts with recourse provisions related to franchisee van loans sold by soc as of 2011 year end 139 million of franchisee van loans contain a recourse provision to snapon if the loans become more than 90 days past due 

  

 

 

  

 

 

  

counterparty risk 

snapon is exposed to credit losses in the event of nonperformance by the counterparties to various financial agreements including its foreign currency forward contracts interest rate swap agreements and treasury lock agreements snapon does not obtain collateral or other security to support financial instruments subject to credit risk but monitors the credit standing of the counterparties and enters into agreements only with financial institution counterparties with a credit rating of a or better snapon does not anticipate nonperformance by its counterparties but cannot provide assurances 

economic risk 

economic risk is the possibility of loss resulting from economic instability in certain areas of the world snapon continually monitors its exposure in these markets 

as a result of the above market credit and economic risks net income and revenues in any particular period may not be representative of fullyear results and may vary significantly from year to year inflation has not had a significant impact on the company 

commodity risk 

snapon is a purchaser of certain commodities such as steel natural gas and electricity the company is also a purchaser of components and parts that are integrated into the company’s end products as well as the purchaser of certain finished goods all of which may contain various commodities including steel aluminum and others snapon’s supply of raw materials and purchased components are generally and readily available from numerous suppliers 

the principal raw material used in the manufacture of the company’s products is steel which the company purchases in competitive pricesensitive markets to meet snapon’s high quality standards the company’s steel needs range from specialized alloys which are available only from a limited group of approved suppliers to commodity types of alloys these raw materials have historically exhibited price and demand cyclicality some of these materials have been and in the future may be in short supply as some steel alloys require specialized manufacturing procedures snapon could experience inventory shortages if it were required to use an alternative manufacturer on short notice additionally unexpected price increases could result in higher prices to snapon’s customers or an erosion of the margins on its products 

snapon believes its ability to sell product is also dependent on the number of vehicles on the road the number of miles driven and the general aging of vehicles these factors affect the frequency type and amount of service and repair performed on vehicles by technicians and therefore affect the demand for the number of technicians the prosperity of the technicians and subsequently the demand the technicians have for the company’s tools other products and services and the value they place on those products and services to the extent that the prices of gasoline and other petroleumbased fuels increase as they have at times in recent years consumers may turn to other methods of transportation including more frequent use of public transportation which could result in a decrease in the use of privately operated vehicles a decrease in the use of privately operated vehicles may lead to fewer repairs and less demand for the company’s products 

to the extent that commodity prices increase and the company does not have firm pricing agreements with its suppliers the company may experience margin declines to the extent that it is not able to increase the selling prices of its products

financial services 

snapon also generates revenue from various financing activities that include i loans to franchisees’ customers and the company’s industrial and other customers for the purchase or lease of tools equipment and diagnostics products on an extended term payment plan and ii business loans and vehicle leases to franchisees the decision to finance through snapon or another financing entity is solely at the customer’s election when assessing customers for potential financing snapon considers various factors regarding ability to pay including financial condition collateral debtservicing ability past payment experience and credit bureau information 

united states 

in the united states snapon offers financing through soc since the july 16 2009 termination of the financial services operating agreement with cit snapon has been providing financing for the majority of new contracts originated by soc the financing revenue from contracts originated after july 16 2009 which are owned and serviced by soc is recognized by soc over the life of the contracts with interest computed on the average daily balances of the underlying contracts 

from 1999 until july 16 2009 cit had been the exclusive purchaser of the financing contracts originated by soc in the united states snapon recorded gains on the sale of the originated contracts as financial services revenue at the time the contracts were sold to cit for contracts sold to cit prior to july 16 2009 soc continues to service the contracts for an estimated servicing fee and such revenue is recognized over the contractual term of the loans 

international 

snapon also offers financing to its franchisees and customer networks through its whollyowned international finance subsidiaries located in canada the united kingdom australia and puerto rico snapon’s international finance subsidiaries own and service the loans originated through their financing programs financing revenue from these contracts is recognized over the contractual term of the loans with interest computed on the average daily balances of the underlying contracts 

other 

franchise fee revenue including nominal nonrefundable initial and ongoing monthly fees primarily for sales business training marketing and product promotion programs is recognized as the fees are earned 

sales and distribution 

snapon markets and distributes its products and related services principally to professional tool and equipment users around the world the two largest market sectors are the vehicle service and repair sector and the industrial sector 

vehicle service and repair sector 

the vehicle service and repair sector has three main customer groups i professional technicians who purchase tools equipment and diagnostics products for themselves ii other professional customers related to automotive repair including owners and managers of independent and oem dealership service and repair shops who purchase tools equipment and diagnostics products for use by multiple technicians within a service or repair facility and iii oems 

snapon provides innovative tool equipment and business solutions as well as technical sales support and training to meet technicians’ evolving needs snapon’s franchise van distribution system offers technicians the convenience of purchasing quality tools at their place of business with minimal disruption of their work routine snapon also provides owners and managers of shops where technicians work with tools diagnostics equipment repair and service information including electronic parts catalogs and shop management products snapon’s oem facilitation business provides oems with products and services including tools consulting and facilitation services which include product procurement distribution and administrative support to customers for their dealership equipment programs 

major challenges for snapon and the vehicle service and repair sector include the increasing rate of technological change within motor vehicles vehicle population growth vehicle life and the resulting impact on the businesses of both our suppliers and customers that is necessitated by such change snapon believes it is a meaningful participant in the market sector for vehicle service and repair 

  

 

 

  

 

  

snapon markets its products globally to a broad crosssection of commercial and industrial customers including maintenance and repair operations manufacturing and assembly facilities various government agencies facilities and operations including military operations vocational and technical schools aerospace and aviation oem and service and repair customers oil and gas developers mining operations energy and power generation equipment fabricators and operators agriculture infrastructure construction companies and other customers that require instrumentation service tools andor equipment for their products 

the industrial sector for snapon has achieved growth in recent years by providing valueadded products and services to an increasingly expanding global base of customers in critical industries particularly those in the market segments of natural resources aerospace government and education through its experienced and dispersed sales organization industrial “solutioneers” strive to develop unique and highly valued productivity solutions for customers worldwide that leverage snapon’s product service and development capabilities 

major challenges in the industrial sector include a highly competitive costconscious environment and a trend toward customers making many of their tool and equipment purchases through one integrated supplier snapon believes it is a meaningful participant in the market sector for industrial tools and equipment 

distribution channels 

snapon serves customers primarily through the following channels of distribution i the mobile van channel ii company direct sales iii distributors and iv ecommerce the following discussion summarizes snapon’s general approach for each channel and is not intended to be allinclusive 

mobile van channel 

in the united states a significant portion of sales to the vehicle service and repair sector are conducted through snapon’s mobile franchise van channel snapon’s franchisees primarily serve vehicle service technicians and vehicle service shop owners generally providing weekly contact at the customer’s place of business franchisees’ sales are concentrated in hand and power tools tool storage products small diagnostic and shop equipment and diagnostics and repair information products which can easily be transported in a van and demonstrated during a brief sales call franchisees purchase snapon’s products at a discount from suggested list prices and resell them at prices established by the franchisee us franchisees are provided a list of places of business that serves as the basis of the franchisee’s sales route 

snapon also offers an option termed the “gateway program” to potential us franchisees that do not meet the franchise qualification requirements gateway program participants have less upfront investment and are provided an initial base level of consigned inventory from snapon to assist them in gaining experience and building equity toward the future purchase of a standard franchise snapon also provides certain franchisees the opportunity to add vans to their franchise or to add a limited number of additional franchises snapon charges nominal initial and ongoing monthly franchise fees since 1991 written franchise agreements have been entered into with all new us franchisees and most pre1991 independent franchisees as of 2010 year end there were 3159 vans operated by us franchisees approximately 96 with written franchise agreements or individuals employed by such franchisees as compared with 3183 vans approximately 96 as of 2009 year end 

snapon has replicated its us franchise van distribution model in certain other countries including australia canada germany japan the united kingdom the netherlands south africa new zealand belgium and ireland in many of these markets as in the united states purchase decisions are generally made or influenced by professional vehicle service technicians and shop owners and managers 

through soc financing is available to us franchisees including financing for van and truck leases working capital loans and loans to enable new franchisees to fund the purchase of the franchise internationally snapon offers financing to its franchisees and customer networks through its whollyowned international finance subsidiaries the decision to finance through snapon or another financing entity is solely at the customer’s election 

snapon supports its franchisees with a field organization of regional offices franchise performance teams diagnostic sales developers “dsds” customer care centers and distribution centers snapon also provides sales and business training and marketing and product promotion programs as well as customer and franchisee financing programs through soc and the company’s international finance subsidiaries all of which are designed to strengthen franchisee sales in the united states and canada the national franchise advisory council and the snapon tools canadian franchise advisory council respectively both of which are composed primarily of franchisees that are elected by franchisees assist snapon in identifying and implementing enhancements to the franchise program 

  

 

 

  

 

  

in the united states franchisees work closely with the dsds the dsds train franchisees on the sale of higherpricepoint diagnostics and demonstrate and sell vehicle service shop management and information systems dsds work independently and with franchisees to identify and generate sales among vehicle service technicians shop owners and managers dsds are snapon employees who are compensated through a combination of base salary and commission a franchisee receives a brokerage fee from certain sales made by the dsds to the franchisee’s customers most products sold through franchisees and the dsds are sold under the snapon bluepoint and sun brand names 

snapon also has a companyowned van program in the united states that is designed to i provide another pool of potential franchisees and field organization personnel ii service customers in select new andor open routes not currently serviced by franchisees and iii allow snapon to pilot new sales and promotional ideas prior to introducing them to franchisees as of 2010 year end companyowned vans comprised approximately 6 of the total us van population snapon may elect to increase or reduce the number of companyowned vans in the future 

company direct sales 

a significant proportion of shop equipment sales in the united states under the john bean and blackhawk brands diagnostic products under the snapon brand and information products under the mitchell1 brand are made by direct and independent sales forces that have responsibility for national and other accounts as the vehicle service and repair sector consolidates with more business conducted by national chains and franchised service centers snapon believes these larger organizations can be serviced most effectively by sales people who can demonstrate and sell the full line of equipment and diagnostic products and services snapon also sells these products and services directly to oems and their franchised dealers 

snapon brand tools and equipment are marketed to industrial and governmental customers in the united states through both industrial sales representatives who are employees and independent industrial distributors in most markets outside the united states industrial sales are conducted through independent distributors the sales representatives focus on industrial customers whose main purchase criteria are quality and service as of 2010 year end snapon had industrial sales representatives in the united states including puerto rico australia canada japan mexico and some european asian latin american and middle eastern countries with the united states representing the majority of snapon’s total industrial sales 

snapon also sells software services and solutions to the automotive power equipment and sports segments products and services are marketed to targeted groups including oems and their dealerships and individual repair shops to effectively reach oems such as general motors company daimler ag ford motor company chrysler group llc toyota motor corporation john deere deere  company jc bamford excavators ltd jcb and yamaha corporation snapon has deployed focused business teams globally 

distributors 

sales of certain tools and equipment are made through independent distributors who purchase the items from snapon and resell them to end users hand tools under the bahco fish and hook and lindström brands and trade names for example are sold through distributors in europe north and south america asia and certain other parts of the world wheel service and other vehicle service equipment are sold through distributors primarily under brands including hofmann john bean cartec and blackhawk diagnostics and equipment are marketed through distributors in south america and asia and through both a direct sales force and distributors in europe under the snapon sun and bahco brands 

ecommerce 

snapon’s ecommerce development initiatives allow snapon to combine the capabilities of the internet with snapon’s existing brand sales and distribution strengths to reach new and underserved customer segments snapon offers current and prospective customers online aroundtheclock access to purchase products through its public internet web site at wwwsnaponcom  the site features an online catalog containing nearly 15000 products including snapon hand tools power tools tool storage units and diagnostic equipment available to consumers and professionals in the united states the united kingdom canada and australia as of 2010 year end snapon had more than 640000 registered users including approximately 46000 industrial accounts ecommerce and certain other system enhancement initiatives are designed to improve productivity and further leverage the oneonone relationships and service snapon has with its current and prospective customers through businesstobusiness and businesstoconsumer capabilities snapon and its franchisees are enhancing communications with customers on a realtime 24 hour 7 day a week basis 

  

 

 

  

 

  

competition 

snapon competes on the basis of its product quality and performance product line breadth and depth service brand awareness and imagery and technological innovation while no single company competes with snapon across all of its product lines and distribution channels various companies compete in one or more product categories andor distribution channels 

snapon believes it is a leading manufacturer and distributor of professional tools diagnostics equipment repair software and solutions offering a broad line of these products to the vehicle service industry various competitors target and sell to professional technicians in the automotive service and repair sector through the mobile van channel snapon also competes with companies that sell tools and equipment to automotive technicians through retail stores and online auto parts supply outlets and tool supply warehousesdistributorships within the power tools category and the industrial sectors snapon has various other competitors including companies with offerings that also overlap with other areas discussed herein major competitors selling diagnostics and shop equipment and information to independent repair shop owners and managers as well as automotive dealerships in the vehicle service and repair sector include both companies that specifically offer products serving this sector as well as the proprietary electronic parts catalog diagnostic and information systems of oems 

raw materials and purchased product 

snapon’s supply of raw materials and purchased components are generally and readily available from numerous suppliers snapon believes it has secured an ample supply of both bar and coil steel for the near future to ensure stable supply to meet material demands the company does not currently anticipate experiencing any significant impact in 2011 from steel pricing or availability issues 

patents trademarks and other intellectual property 

snapon vigorously pursues and relies on patent protection to protect its intellectual property and its position in its markets as of 2010 year end snapon and its subsidiaries held over 770 active and pending patents in the united states and over 1615 active and pending patents outside of the united states sales relating to any single patent did not represent a material portion of snapon’s revenues in the last three years 

examples of products that have features or designs that benefit from patent protection include wheel alignment systems wheel balancers tire changers lifts test lanes sealed ratchets electronic torque instruments ratcheting screwdrivers emissionssensing devices and diagnostic equipment 

much of the technology used in the manufacture of vehicle service tools and equipment is in the public domain snapon relies primarily on trade secret protection to protect proprietary processes used in manufacturing methods and processes are patented when appropriate copyright protection is also utilized when appropriate 

trademarks used by snapon are of continuing importance to snapon in the marketplace trademarks have been registered in the united states and more than 100 other countries and additional applications for trademark registrations are pending snapon vigorously polices proper use of its trademarks snapon’s right to manufacture and sell certain products is dependent upon licenses from others however these products under license do not represent a material portion of snapon’s net sales 

domain names have become a valuable corporate asset for companies around the world including snapon domain names often contain a trademark or service mark or even a corporate name and are often considered intellectual property the recognition and value of the snapon name trademark and domain name are core strengths of the company 

snapon strategically licenses the snapon brand to carefully selected manufacturing and distribution companies for items such as apparel work boots lighting and a variety of other goods in order to further build equity and market presence for the company’s strongest brand 

  

 

 

  

 

  

environmental 

snapon is subject to various environmental laws ordinances regulations and other requirements of government authorities in the united states and other nations at snapon these environmental liabilities are managed through the snapon environmental health and safety management system “eh  sms” which is applied worldwide the system is based upon continual improvement and is certified to iso 140012004 and ohsas 180012007 verified through det norske veritas dnv certification inc 

snapon believes that it complies with applicable environmental control requirements in its operations expenditures on environmental matters through eh  sms have not had and snapon does not for the foreseeable future expect them to have a material effect upon snapon’s capital expenditures earnings or competitive position 

employees 

at the end of january 2011 snapon employed approximately 11300 people as compared to approximately 11000 people at the end of january 2010 

approximately 2850 employees or 25 of snapon’s worldwide workforce are represented by unions andor covered under collective bargaining agreements approximately 1450 employees are covered under agreements expiring in 2011 in recent years snapon has not experienced any significant work slowdowns stoppages or other labor disruptions 

the number of covered union employees whose contracts expire within the next five years approximates 1450 employees in 2011 550 employees in 2012 400 employees in 2013 and 250 employees in 2014 there are no contracts currently scheduled to expire in 2015 

there can be no assurance that future contracts with snapon’s unions will be renegotiated upon terms acceptable to snapon 

working capital 

most of snapon’s businesses are not seasonal and their inventory needs are relatively constant since the termination of the financial services operating agreement with cit on july 16 2009 snapon has been using its working capital to fund in part the growth of the onbook receivables originated by soc snapon did not have a significant backlog of orders at 2010 year end 

snapon’s liquidity and capital resources and use of working capital are discussed herein in “part ii item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” 

as of 2010 year end neither snapon nor any of its segments depend on any single customer small group of customers or government for any material part of its revenues prior to july 16 2009 snapon’s financial services segment depended on cit for more than 10 of its revenues 




 item 1a risk factors 

in evaluating the company careful consideration should be given to the following risk factors in addition to the other information included in this annual report on form 10k including the consolidated financial statements and the related notes each of these risk factors could adversely affect the company’s business operating results cash flows andor financial condition as well as adversely affect the value of an investment in the company’s common stock 

economic conditions and world events could affect our operating results 

we our franchisees and our customers may continue to be adversely affected by challenging economic conditions these conditions may result in reduced consumer and investor confidence instability in the credit and financial markets volatile corporate profits and reduced business as well as consumer spending we our franchisees and our customers and the economy as a whole also may be affected by future world or local events outside our control such as acts of terrorism developments in the war on terrorism conflicts in international situations and natural disasters these factors may affect our results of operations by reducing our sales margins andor net income as a result of a slowdown in customer orders or order cancellations in addition political and social turmoil related to international conflicts and terrorist acts may put pressure on economic conditions abroad unstable political social and economic conditions may make it difficult for our franchisees customers suppliers and us to accurately forecast and plan future business activities if such conditions persist our business financial condition results of operations and cash flow could be negatively affected 

  

 

 

  

 

  

the performance of snapon’s mobile van tool distribution business depends on the success of its franchisees 

approximately 39 of our 2010 revenues were generated by the snapon tools group which consists of snapon’s business operations serving the worldwide van channel except in limited circumstances each of our mobile tool vans is operated by a franchisee pursuant to a franchise agreement snapon’s success is dependent on its relationships with franchisees individually and collectively as they are the primary sales and service link between the company and vehicle service and repair technicians who are an important class of end users for snapon’s products and services if our franchisees are not successful or if we do not maintain an effective relationship with our franchisees the delivery of products the collection of receivables andor our relationship with end users could be adversely affected and thereby negatively impact our business financial condition results of operations and cash flow 

in addition if we are unable to maintain effective relationships with franchisees snapon or the franchisees may choose to terminate the relationship which may result in i open routes in which enduser customers are not provided reliable service ii litigation resulting from termination iii reduced collections or increased writeoffs of franchisee receivables owed to snapon andor iv reduced collections or increased writeoffs of extended credit contracts and to a lesser extent lease contracts that are collected by franchisees on behalf of soc as snapon has approximately 4800 franchisees worldwide and most of these franchise relationships are governed by contract litigation can result from the termination of these relationships 

raw material and energy price fluctuations and shortages including steel and various fuel sources could adversely affect the ability to obtain needed manufacturing materials and could adversely affect our results of operations 

the principal raw material used in the manufacture of our products is steel which we purchase in competitive pricesensitive markets to meet snapon’s high quality standards our steel needs range from specialized alloys which are available only from a limited group of approved suppliers to commodity types of alloys these raw materials have historically exhibited price and demand fluctuations of a cyclical nature some of these materials have been and in the future may be in short supply particularly in the event of a general economic recovery as some steel alloys require specialized manufacturing procedures we could experience inventory shortages if we were required to use an alternative manufacturer on short notice additionally unexpected price increases for other raw materials could result in higher prices to our customers or an erosion of the margins on our products 

we believe our ability to sell our products is also dependent on the number of vehicles on the road the number of miles driven and the general aging of vehicles these factors affect the frequency type and amount of service and repair performed on vehicles by technicians and therefore affect the demand for the number of technicians the prosperity of the technicians and subsequently the demand technicians have for our tools other products and services and the value technicians place on those products and services to the extent that the prices of gasoline and other petroleumbased fuels increase consumers may turn to other methods of transportation including more frequent use of public transportation a decrease in the use of privately operated vehicles may lead to fewer repairs and less demand for our products 

we use various energy sources to transport produce and distribute products and some of our products have components that are petroleum based petroleum and energy prices have periodically increased significantly over short periods of time further volatility and changes may be caused by market fluctuations supply and demand currency fluctuation production and transportation disruption world events and changes in governmental programs energy price increases raise both our operating costs and the costs of our materials and we may not be able to increase our prices enough to offset these costs higher prices also may reduce the level of future customer orders and our profitability 

exposure to credit risks of customers and resellers may make it difficult to collect receivables and could adversely affect operating results and financial condition 

industry and economic conditions have the potential to weaken the financial position of some of our customers if circumstances surrounding our customers’ financial capabilities were to deteriorate such receivables writedowns or writeoffs would negatively affect our operating results for the period in which they occur and if large could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flow 

  

 

 

  

 

  

regulatory changes related to financial services operations could adversely affect operating results and financial condition 

financial services operations of all kinds are subject to increasing regulation in addition to potentially increasing the costs of doing business new laws and regulations or changes to existing laws and regulations may affect the relationships between creditors and debtors or inhibit the rights of creditors to collect amounts owed to them for example if such changes impede our ability to collect amounts that are due to us or limit the rates we can charge our profitability would suffer 

instability and uncertainty in the credit and financial markets could adversely impact the availability of credit that we and our customers need to operate our businesses 

we depend upon the availability of credit to operate our business including the financing of receivables from enduser customers that are originated by soc our enduser customers franchisees and suppliers also require access to credit for their businesses instability and uncertainty in the credit and financial markets could adversely impact the availability of future financing and the terms on which it might be available to snapon its enduser customers franchisees and suppliers inability to access credit markets or a deterioration in the terms on which financing might be available could have an adverse impact on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flow 

we have increased our financial leverage which could affect our operations and profitability 

over the past several years we have increased our use of borrowed funds primarily to fund the receivables of soc and to finance acquisitions the company’s increased leverage may affect both our availability of additional capital resources in the future as well as our operations in several ways including 

 

     while we believe we will have the ability to service our debt and obtain additional resources in the future if and when needed that will depend upon our results of operations and financial position at the time the thencurrent state of the credit and financial markets and other factors that may be beyond our control therefore we cannot give assurances that credit will be available on terms that we consider attractive or at all if and when necessary or beneficial to us 

failure to achieve expected investment returns on pension plan assets as well as changes in interest rates could adversely impact our results of operations financial position and cash flow 

snapon sponsors various defined benefit pension plans “pension plans” the assets of the pension plans are broadly diversified in an attempt to mitigate the risk of a large loss the assets are invested in equity securities fixed income securities real estate and other real assets other alternative investments and cash required funding for the company’s defined benefit pension plans is determined in accordance with guidelines set forth in the federal employee retirement income security act erisa additional contributions to enhance the funded status of the pension plans can be made at the company’s discretion however there can be no assurance that the value of the pension plan assets or the investment returns on those plan assets will be sufficient to meet the future benefit obligations of such plans in addition during periods of adverse investment market conditions and declining interest rates the company may be required to make additional cash contributions to the plans that could reduce our financial flexibility 

our pension plan obligations are affected by changes in market interest rates significant fluctuations in market interest rates have added and may further add volatility to our pension plan obligations declining market interest rates will increase our pension plan obligations while our plan assets are broadly diversified there are inherent market risks associated with investments our pension plan assets in the aggregate incurred a substantial loss in 2008 as a result of market conditions if adverse market conditions occur our plan assets could incur additional losses since we may need to make additional contributions to address an increase in obligations andor a loss in plan assets the combination of declining market interest rates andor past or future plan asset investment losses could adversely impact our financial position results of operations and cash flows 

  

 

 

  

 

  

the company’s pension plan expense is comprised of the following factors i service cost ii interest on projected benefit obligations iii the expected return on plan assets iv the amortization of prior service costs and v the effects of actuarial gains and losses the accounting for pensions involves the estimation of a number of factors that are highly uncertain certain factors such as the interest cost and the expected return on plan assets are impacted by changes in market interest rates and the value of plan assets a significant decrease in market interest rates and a decrease in the fair value of plan assets would increase net pension expense and may adversely affect the company’s future results of operations see note 11 to the consolidated financial statements for further information on the company’s pension plans 

our inability to provide acceptable financing alternatives to enduser customers and franchisees could adversely impact our operating results 

an integral component of our business and profitability is our ability to offer financing alternatives to enduser customers and franchisees since the july 16 2009 termination of our financial services operating agreement with cit snapon is providing the resources for the majority of this financing at soc as a result we are more dependent upon our ability to obtain capital resources or other financing on terms that we believe are attractive to support soc’s onbook receivables the lack of our ability to obtain capital resources or financing whether resulting from the state of the financial markets our own operating performance or other factors would negatively affect our operating results and financial condition adverse fluctuations in interest rates andor our ability to provide competitive financing programs for other reasons could also have an adverse impact on our revenue and profitability 

the steps taken to restructure operations rationalize operating footprint lower operating expenses and achieve greater efficiencies in the supply chain could disrupt business 

we have taken steps in the past and expect to take additional steps in 2011 intended to improve customer service and to drive further efficiencies and reduce costs some of which could be disruptive to our business these actions collectively across our operating groups are focused on the following 

 

       we believe that by executing on these focus areas along with a continued commitment to new innovative products and rci initiatives to drive higher levels of productivity and lower costs the company and its franchisees may realize stronger growth and profitability however failure to succeed in the implementation of any or all of these actions could result in an inability to achieve our financial goals and could be disruptive to the business 

in addition reductions to headcount and other cost reduction measures may result in the loss of technical expertise that could adversely affect our research and development efforts and ability to meet product development schedules efforts to reduce components of expense could result in the recording of charges for inventory and technologyrelated writeoffs workforce reduction costs or other charges relating to the consolidation or closure of facilities if we were to incur a substantial charge to further these efforts our earnings per share would be adversely affected in such period if we are unable to effectively manage our cost reduction and restructuring efforts our business financial condition results of operations and cash flow could be negatively affected 

  

 

 

  

 

  

failure to maintain effective distribution of products and services could adversely impact revenue gross margin and profitability 

we use a variety of distribution methods to sell our products and services successfully managing the interaction of our distribution efforts to reach various potential customer segments for our products and services is a complex process moreover since each distribution method has distinct risks costs and gross margins our failure to implement the most advantageous balance in the delivery model for our products and services could adversely affect our revenue and gross margins and therefore our profitability 

risks associated with the disruption of manufacturing operations could adversely affect profitability or competitive position 

we manufacture a significant portion of the products we sell any prolonged disruption in the operations of our existing manufacturing facilities whether due to technical or labor difficulties facility consolidation or closure actions lack of raw material or component availability destruction of or damage to any facility as a result of natural disasters use and storage of hazardous materials or other events or other reasons could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flow 

the inability to continue to introduce new products that respond to customer needs and achieve market acceptance could result in lower revenues and reduced profitability 

sales from new products represent a significant portion of our net sales and are expected to continue to represent a significant component of our future net sales we may not be able to compete effectively unless we continue to enhance existing products or introduce new products to the marketplace in a timely manner product improvements and new product introductions require significant financial and other resources including significant planning design development and testing at the technological product and manufacturing process levels our competitors’ new products may beat our products to market be more effective with more features be less expensive than our products andor render our products obsolete any new products that we develop may not receive market acceptance or otherwise generate any meaningful net sales or profits for us relative to our expectations based on among other things existing and anticipated investments in manufacturing capacity and commitments to fund advertising marketing promotional programs and research and development 

the effects of brand rationalization dealership closures andor other difficulties in the automotive industry could impact our business and operating results 

some of our business units have substantial interrelationships with the automotive industry weakness in the automotive industry has in recent years resulted in the bankruptcy of certain automobile manufacturers as well as suppliers and dealers who are dependent upon them discontinuance of auto brands and other significant changes in the industry the ongoing effects of these changes cannot yet be fully determined however they have resulted in a reduction in the number of automobile dealerships additionally weakness of companies in the automotive industry could affect their levels of purchases from us and the collectability of amounts owed to us even though we believe that our products and services enhance productivity a reduction in the number of automotive manufacturers andor dealers or their capital expenditures could substantially affect our sales any of those factors could negatively affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flow 

the global tool equipment and diagnostics and repair information industries are competitive 

we face strong competition in all of our market segments price competition in our various industries is intense and pricing pressures from competitors and customers are increasing in general as a manufacturer and marketer of premium products and services the expectations of snapon’s customers and its franchisees are high and increasing any inability to maintain customer satisfaction could diminish snapon’s premium image and reputation and could result in a lessening of its ability to command premium pricing we expect that the level of competition will remain high in the future which could limit our ability to maintain or increase market share or profitability 

  

 

 

  

 

  

product liability claims and litigation could affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flow 

the products that we design andor manufacture can lead to product liability claims being filed against us to the extent that plaintiffs are successful in showing that defects in the design or manufacture of our products led to personal injury or property damage we may be subject to claims for damages although we are insured for damages above a certain amount we bear the costs and expenses associated with defending claims including frivolous lawsuits and are responsible for damages below the insurance retention amount as a manufacturer we can be subject to the costs and potential negative publicity of product recalls which could impact our results 

new legislation and regulations may affect our business and results of operations 

there has recently been an increase in legislative and regulatory activity particularly in the united states that could significantly impact our business and the economy as a whole for example the affordable care act “act” which was enacted in march 2010 and will be phased in over the next several years significantly affects the provision of both health care services and benefits in the united states this act may impact our cost of providing our employees and retirees with health insurance andor benefits and may also impact various other aspects of our business also the recently enacted doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act of 2010 may affect among other matters our financial services businesses by requiring changes in the way in which we provide credit or by otherwise increasing the expenses of that operation as well as the costs related to corporate governance disclosures and general securities law compliance 

these developments and other potential future legislation and regulations may also adversely affect the customers to which and the markets into which we sell our products and increase our costs and otherwise negatively affect our business financial condition or results of operations including in ways that cannot yet be foreseen 

legal disputes could adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flow 

from time to time we are subject to legal disputes that are being litigated andor settled in the ordinary course of business as described more fully below in “part i item 3 legal proceedings” snapon has a dispute pending in arbitration with cit in which both parties make claims relating to matters that occurred during the course of their financial services joint venture that dispute and any other dispute or future lawsuit could result in the diversion of management’s time and attention away from business operations additionally negative developments with respect to legal disputes and the costs incurred in defending ourselves could have an adverse impact on us adverse outcomes or settlements could also require us to pay damages potentially in excess of amounts reserved or incur liability for other remedies that could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

information technology infrastructure is critical to supporting business objectives failure of our information technology infrastructure to operate effectively could adversely affect our business 

we depend heavily on information technology infrastructure to achieve our business objectives if a problem occurs that impairs this infrastructure the resulting disruption could impede our ability to record or process orders manufacture and ship in a timely manner or otherwise carry on business in the normal course any such events could cause us to lose customers or revenue and could require us to incur significant expense to remediate 

in association with initiatives to better integrate business units rationalize operating footprint and improve responsiveness to franchisees and customers snapon is continually replacing and enhancing its existing global enterprise resource planning erp management information systems as we integrate implement and deploy new information technology processes and a common information infrastructure across our global operations we could experience disruptions in our business that could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flow 

the recognition of impairment charges on goodwill or other intangible assets would adversely impact future financial position and results of operations 

  

 

 

  

 

  

we are required to perform impairment tests on our goodwill and other intangibles annually or at any time when events occur that could impact the value of our business segments our determination of whether impairment has occurred is based on a comparison of each of our reporting units’ fair market value with its carrying value significant and unanticipated changes in circumstances such as significant adverse changes in business climate adverse actions by regulators unanticipated competition loss of key customers including large customers associated with the automotive industry andor changes in technology or markets could require a provision for impairment in a future period that could substantially impact our reported earnings and reduce our consolidated net worth and shareholders’ equity should the economic environment in these markets deteriorate our results of operations and financial position could be materially impacted including as a result of the effects of potential impairment writedowns of goodwill andor other intangible assets related to these businesses 

failure to adequately protect intellectual property could adversely affect our business 

intellectual property rights are an important and integral component of our business we attempt to protect our intellectual property rights through a combination of patent trademark copyright and trade secret laws as well as licensing agreements and thirdparty nondisclosure and assignment agreements adverse determinations in a judicial or administrative proceeding could prevent us from manufacturing and selling our products or prevent us from stopping others from manufacturing and selling competing products failure to obtain or maintain adequate protection of our intellectual property rights for any reason could have a material adverse effect on our business 

foreign operations are subject to currency exchange political economic and other risks that could adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flow 

the reporting currency for snapon’s consolidated financial statements is the us dollar certain of the company’s assets liabilities expenses and revenues are denominated in currencies other than the us dollar in preparing snapon’s consolidated financial statements those assets liabilities expenses and revenues are translated into us dollars at applicable exchange rates increases or decreases in exchange rates between the us dollar and those other currencies affect the us dollar value of those items as reflected in snapon’s consolidated financial statements substantial fluctuations in the value of the us dollar could have a significant impact on the company’s financial condition and results of operations 

approximately 41 of our revenues in 2010 were generated outside of the united states future growth rates and success of our business depends in large part on continued growth in our nonus operations including growth in emerging markets numerous risks and uncertainties affect our nonus operations these risks and uncertainties include political economic and social instability such as acts of war civil disturbance or acts of terrorism local labor conditions changes in government policies and regulations including imposition or increases in withholding and other taxes on remittances and other payments by international subsidiaries transportation delays or interruptions and difficulties in enforcement of contract and intellectual property rights should the economic environment in our nonus markets deteriorate from current levels including as a result of the effects of potential impairment writedowns of goodwill andor other intangible assets related to these businesses our results of operations and financial position could be materially impacted 

we are also affected by changes in inflation rates and interest rates additionally cash generated in nonus jurisdictions may be difficult to repatriate to the united states in a taxefficient manner our foreign operations are also subject to other risks and challenges such as the need to staff and manage diverse workforces respond to the needs of multiple national and international marketplaces and differing business climates and cultures in various countries 

our operations expose us to the risk of environmental liabilities costs litigation and violations that could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and reputation 

certain of our operations are subject to environmental laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which they operate which impose limitations on the discharge of pollutants into the ground air and water and establish standards for the generation treatment use storage and disposal of hazardous wastes we must also comply with various health and safety regulations in the united states and abroad in connection with our operations failure to comply with any of these laws could result in civil and criminal monetary and nonmonetary penalties and damage to our reputation in addition we may incur costs related to remedial efforts or alleged environmental damage associated with past or current waste disposal practices legislation has been proposed and governmental regulatory action has been both proposed and taken that may significantly impact environmental compliance in the united states these actions could increase our costs of production by raising the cost of energy as well as by further restricting emissions or other processes that we currently use in our operations we cannot provide assurance that our costs of complying with current or future environmental protection and health and safety laws will not exceed our estimates 

  

 

 

  

 

  

the inability to successfully defend claims from taxing authorities could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flow 

we conduct business in many countries which requires us to interpret the income tax laws and rulings in each of those taxing jurisdictions due to the subjectivity of tax laws between those jurisdictions as well as the subjectivity of factual interpretations our estimates of income tax liabilities may differ from actual payments or assessments claims from taxing authorities related to these differences could have an adverse impact on our financial condition results of operations and cash flow 

failure to attract and retain qualified personnel could lead to a loss of revenue andor profitability 

snapon’s success depends in part on the efforts and abilities of its senior management team and other key employees their skills experience and industry contacts significantly benefit our operations and administration the failure to attract and retain members of our senior management team and other key employees could have a negative effect on our operating results in addition transitions of important responsibilities to new individuals inherently include the possibility of disruptions to our business and operations which could negatively affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flow 

we may not successfully integrate businesses we acquire which could have an adverse impact on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flow 

the pursuit of future growth through acquisitions including participation in joint ventures involves significant risks that could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flow these risks include

we believe our 2010 operating performance evidences stabilization in the overall business environment significant progress on our strategic priorities and continued benefits from our snapon value creation processes considerable progress was made as we continued investing in our strategic growth initiatives aimed at strengthening our business models pursuing geographic and customer diversification and expanding our presence in emerging markets in 2010 we maintained a balance between a disciplined operational approach and continued focus on our most important strategic growth initiatives aimed at enhancing the franchisee network expanding in the vehicle repair garage extending in critical industries and building in emerging markets 

our global financial services operations serve a significant strategic role in providing financing options for our franchisees’ customers our franchisees and customers in other parts of our business fiscal 2010 marked the first full year since our us financial services operation snapon credit llc “soc” transitioned from a financial services joint venture with cit group inc “cit” to a whollyowned subsidiary following the july 16 2009 termination of the financial services operating agreement with cit we have been steadily growing our onbook finance portfolio and providing financing for the majority of new loans originated by soc going forward we expect that our financial services businesses including both soc and our whollyowned international finance subsidiaries will be meaningful contributors to our operating earnings we expect that operating earnings from financial services which is before interest expense will continue to improve as the onbook finance portfolio grows 

we believe that continued advancement of our strategic initiatives will enable us to capitalize on our defined runways for growth and be decisive in creating longterm value for our shareholders specific opportunities for growth in 2011 include the areas of vehicle repair critical industries and emerging markets in vehicle repair we intend to enhance our mobile tool distribution network by reaching out to more vehicle repair technicians similarly we seek to further penetrate another key customer group within vehicle repair – shop owners and managers – through direct and distributor channels within our repair systems  information group we also expect to continue rolling the snapon brand “out of the garage” providing professional technicians in critical industries including power generation oil and gas aerospace military mining natural resources alternative energy and education with a broad range of productivity solutions suited to their unique needs we also intend to continue investing in emerging markets including the further expansion of our manufacturing capacity and product offerings in china india and eastern europe global market conditions in 2011 including the depth and breadth of the economic recovery may impact the level and timing of resources deployed in pursuit of these initiatives

     cash flows 

net cash provided by operating activities was 1404 million in 2010 as compared to 3471 million in 2009 the lower net cash provided by operating activities in 2010 was primarily due to net changes in operating assets and liabilities as a result of higher sales and increased customer demand including 1166 million of higher trade contract and other receivables and 552 million of increased inventories the decrease in net cash provided by operating activities in 2010 also included a fourth quarter 2010 discretionary cash contribution of 480 million to the company’s domestic pension plans

new accounting standards 

see note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for information on new accounting standards 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the consolidated financial statements and related notes contain information that is pertinent to management’s discussion and analysis the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period these estimates are generally based on historical experience current conditions and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily available from other sources as well as identifying and assessing our accounting treatment with respect to commitments and contingencies actual results could differ from those estimates 

the company’s significant accounting policies are described in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements 

  

 

 

  

 

  

snapon considers the following policies and estimates to be the most critical in understanding the judgments that are involved in the preparation of the company’s consolidated financial statements and the uncertainties that could impact the company’s financial position results of operations and cash flows 

revenue recognition snapon recognizes revenue from the sale of tools diagnostics and equipment solutions when contract terms are met collectability is reasonably assured and a product is shipped or risk of ownership has been transferred to and accepted by the customer for sales contingent upon customer acceptance or product installation revenue recognition is deferred until such obligations are fulfilled estimated product returns are recorded as a reduction in reported revenues at the time of sale based upon historical product return experience and gross profit margin adjusted for known trends provisions for customer volume rebates discounts and allowances are also recorded as a reduction of reported revenues at the time of sale based on historical experience and known trends revenue related to maintenance and subscription agreements is recognized over the terms of the respective agreements 

snapon also recognizes revenue related to multiple element arrangements including sales of software and softwarerelated services when a sales arrangement contains multiple elements such as hardware and software products andor services snapon uses estimates of fair value for hardware elements and vendor specific objective evidence “vsoe” of fair value for software elements to allocate revenue to each element based on its relative fair value and when necessary uses the residual method to assign value to the delivered elements when vsoe only exists for the undelivered elements the amount assigned to future delivery of products or services is recognized when the product is delivered andor when the services are performed in instances where the product andor services are performed over an extended period as is the case with subscription agreements or the providing of ongoing support revenue is generally recognized on a straightline basis over the term of the applicable agreement which generally ranges from 12 to 60 months 

franchise fee revenue including nominal nonrefundable initial and ongoing monthly fees primarily for sales and business training and marketing and product promotion programs is recognized as the fees are earned 

financial services revenue snapon also generates revenue from various financing programs that include i loans to franchisees’ customers and snapon’s industrial and other customers for the purchase or lease of tools equipment and diagnostics products on an extended term payment plan and ii business loans and vehicle leases to franchisees these financing programs are offered through snapon’s whollyowned finance subsidiaries financial services revenue consists of installment contract revenue and franchisee loan receivable revenue for periods prior to july 16 2009 financial services revenue also included gains from soc’s sales of originated contracts to cit the decision to finance through snapon or another financing entity is solely at the election of the customer when assessing customers for potential financing snapon considers various factors regarding ability to pay including customers’ financial condition collateral debtservicing ability past payment experience and credit bureau information for finance and contract receivables snapon assesses these factors through the use of credit quality indicators consisting of consumer credit risk scores combined with internal credit risk grades collection experience and other internal metrics 

prior to july 16 2009 soc substantially sold all of its loan originations to cit on a limited recourse basis soc retained the right to service such loans for a contractual servicing fee contractual servicing fees were 49 million in 2010 83 million in 2009 and 92 million in 2008 

snapon’s international finance subsidiaries own the loans originated through their financing programs loans originated by soc subsequent to july 16 2009 and loans retained by soc prior to july 16 2009 are also owned by snapon revenue from interest income on the onbook financing portfolio is recognized over the life of the contracts with interest computed on the average daily balances of the underlying contracts 

impairment of goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets  goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets are tested for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the assets might be impaired annual impairment tests are performed by the company in the second quarter of each year 

snapon evaluates the recoverability of goodwill by estimating the future discounted cash flows of the businesses to which the goodwill relates estimated cash flows and related goodwill are grouped at the reporting unit level the company has determined that its reporting units for testing goodwill impairment are its operating segments or components of an operating segment that constitute a business for which discrete financial information is available and for which segment management regularly reviews the operating results within its four reportable operating segments the company has identified 11 reporting units 

  

 

 

 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued 

 

 

 

  

snapon evaluates the recoverability of goodwill by utilizing an income approach that estimates the fair value of the future discounted cash flows of the reporting units to which the goodwill relates the future projections which are based on both past performance and the projections and assumptions used in the company’s current and long range operating plans are subject to change as a result of changing economic and competitive conditions significant estimates used by management in the discounted cash flows methodology include estimates of future cash flows based on expected growth rates price increases capital expenditures working capital levels the benefits of recent acquisitions and expected synergies and a weightedaverage cost of capital that reflects the specific risk profile of the reporting unit being tested the company’s methodologies for valuing goodwill are applied consistently on a yearoveryear basis the assumptions used in performing the second quarter 2010 impairment calculations were evaluated in light of current market and business conditions snapon continues to believe that the future discounted cash flow valuation model provides the most reasonable and meaningful fair value estimate based upon the reporting units’ projections of future operating results and cash flows and replicates how market participants would value the company’s reporting units in an orderly transaction 

in the event the fair value of a reporting unit is less than the carrying value including goodwill the company would then perform an additional assessment that would compare the implied fair value of goodwill with the carrying amount of goodwill the determination of implied fair value of goodwill would require management to compare the estimated fair value of the reporting unit to the estimated fair value of the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit if necessary the company may consult with valuation specialists to assist with the assessment of the estimated fair value of the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit if the implied fair value of the goodwill is less than the carrying value an impairment loss would be recorded 

snapon also evaluates the recoverability of its indefinitelived trademarks by utilizing an income approach that estimates the fair value of the future discounted cash flows of each of its trademarks the future projections which are based on both past performance and the projections and assumptions used in the company’s current and long range operating plans are subject to change as a result of changing economic and competitive conditions significant estimates used by management in the discounted cash flows methodology include estimates of future cash flows based on expected growth and royalty rates expected synergies and a weightedaverage cost of equity that reflects the specific risk profile of the trademark being tested the company’s methodologies for valuing trademarks are applied consistently on a yearoveryear basis the assumptions used in performing the second quarter 2010 impairment calculations were evaluated in light of current market and business conditions snapon continues to believe that the future discounted cash flow valuation model provides the most reasonable and meaningful fair value estimate based upon the trademarks’ projected future cash flows and replicates how market participants would value the company’s trademarks in an orderly transaction 

snapon did not recognize any impairment on its goodwill or other indefinitelived intangible assets in 2010 2009 or 2008 inherent in fair value determinations are significant judgments and estimates including material assumptions about future revenue profitability and cash flows the company’s operational plans and its interpretation of current economic indicators should the operations of the businesses with which goodwill or other indefinitelived intangible assets are associated incur significant declines in profitability and cash flow due to significant adverse changes in business climate adverse actions by regulators unanticipated competition loss of key customers andor changes in technology or markets some or all of the recorded goodwill or other indefinitelived intangible assets could be subject to impairment and could result in a material adverse effect on snapon’s financial position or results of operations 

snapon completed its annual impairment testing of goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets in the second quarter of 2010 the results of which did not result in any impairment although the company consistently uses the same methods in developing the assumptions and estimates underlying the fair value calculations such estimates are uncertain by nature and can vary from actual results in performing its annual impairment testing the company performed a sensitivity analysis on the material assumptions used in the discounted cash flow valuation models for each of its 11 reporting units based on the company’s second quarter 2010 impairment testing and assuming a hypothetical 10 decrease in the estimated fair values of each of its 11 reporting units the hypothetical fair value of each of the company’s 11 reporting units would have been greater than its carrying value see note 6 to the consolidated financial statements for further information about goodwill and other intangible assets 

impairment of longlived and amortized intangible assets snapon performs impairment evaluations of its longlived assets including property plant and equipment and intangible assets with finite lives whenever business conditions or events indicate that those assets may be impaired when the estimated future undiscounted cash flows to be generated by the assets are less than the carrying value of the longlived assets the assets are written down to fair market value and a charge is recorded to current operations 

  

 

 

  

 

 

  

significant and unanticipated changes in circumstances such as significant adverse changes in business climate adverse actions by regulators unanticipated competition loss of key customers andor changes in technology or markets could require a provision for impairment in a future period 

allowances for doubtful accounts snapon maintains allowances for doubtful accounts to absorb probable losses inherent in its portfolio of receivables the allowances for doubtful accounts represent management’s estimate of the losses inherent in the company’s receivables portfolio based on ongoing assessments and evaluations of collectability and historical loss experience in estimating losses inherent in each of its receivable portfolios trade finance and contract receivables snapon uses historical loss experience rates by portfolio and applies them to a related aging analysis determination of the proper level of allowances by portfolio requires management to exercise significant judgment about the timing frequency and severity of credit losses that could materially affect the provision for credit losses and therefore net income the allowances for doubtful accounts takes into consideration numerous quantitative and qualitative factors by loan type including historical loss experience portfolio duration collection experience delinquency trends economic conditions and credit risk quality as follows 

 

  

  

  

  

 management performs detailed reviews of its receivables on a monthly andor quarterly basis to assess the adequacy of the allowances based on historical and current trends and other factors affecting credit losses and to determine if any impairment has occurred a receivable is impaired when it is probable that all amounts related to the receivable will not be collected according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement in circumstances where the company is aware of a specific customer’s inability to meet its financial obligations a specific reserve is recorded against amounts due to reduce the net recognized receivable to the amount reasonably expected to be collected additions to the allowances for doubtful accounts are maintained through adjustments to the provision for credit losses which are charged to current period earnings amounts determined to be uncollectable are charged directly against the allowances while amounts recovered on previously chargedoff accounts increase the allowances net chargeoffs include the principal amount of losses charged off as well as chargedoff interest and fees recovered interest and fees previously chargedoff are recorded through the allowances for doubtful accounts finance receivables are assessed for chargeoff when an account becomes 120 days past due and are chargedoff typically within 60 days of asset repossession contract receivables related to equipment leases are generally chargedoff when an account becomes 150 days past due while contract receivables related to franchise finance and van leases are generally charged off up to 180 days past the asset return for finance and contract receivables customer bankruptcies are generally chargedoff upon notification that the associated debt is not being reaffirmed or in any event no later than 180 days past due 

  

 

 

 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued 

 

 

 

  

snapon does not believe that trade accounts finance or contract receivables represent significant concentrations of credit risk because of the diversified portfolio of individual customers and geographical areas see note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for further information on allowances for doubtful accounts 

excess and obsolete inventory snapon records allowances for excess and obsolete inventory based on historical and estimated future demand and market conditions allowances for raw materials are largely based on an analysis of raw material age and actual physical inspection of raw material for fitness for use as part of evaluating the adequacy of allowances for workinprogress and finished goods management reviews individual product stockkeeping units skus by product category and product life cycle cost adjustments for each product categoryproduct lifecycle state are generally established and maintained based on a combination of historical experience forecasted sales and promotions technological obsolescence inventory age and other actual known conditions and circumstances should actual product marketability and raw material fitness for use be affected by conditions that are different from management estimates further adjustments to inventory allowances may be required 

pension benefits the pension benefit obligation and related pension expense are calculated in accordance with us gaap and are impacted by certain actuarial assumptions changes in these assumptions are primarily influenced by factors outside of snapon’s control and can have a significant effect on the amounts reported in the financial statements snapon believes that the two most critical assumptions are i the expected return on plan assets and ii the assumed discount rate 

pension expense increases as the expected rate of return on plan assets decreases lowering the expected rate of return assumption for snapon’s domestic pension plan assets by 50 basis points would have increased snapon’s 2010 domestic pension expense by approximately 32 million snapon uses a threeyear marketrelated value asset method of amortizing the difference between actual and expected returns on its domestic plan assets 

the objective of snapon’s discount rate assumption is to reflect the rate at which the pension benefits could be effectively settled in making this determination the company takes into account the timing and amount of benefits that would be available under the plans the methodology for selecting the discount rate as of 2010 year end was to match the plan’s cash flows to that of a theoretical bond portfolio yield curve that provides the equivalent yields on zerocoupon bonds with an aa rating or better for each maturity the selection of the 53 weightedaverage discount rate for snapon’s domestic pension plans represents the single rate that produces the same present value of cash flows as the estimated benefit plan payments lowering snapon’s domestic discount rate assumption by 50 basis points would have increased snapon’s 2010 domestic pension expense and projected benefit obligation by approximately 48 million and 492 million respectively at 2010 year end snapon’s domestic projected benefit obligation comprised approximately 82 of snapon’s worldwide projected benefit obligation the weightedaverage discount rate for snapon’s foreign pension plans of 53 represents the single rate that produces the same present value of cash flows as the estimated benefit plan payments lowering snapon’s foreign discount rate assumption by 50 basis points would have increased snapon’s 2010 foreign pension expense and projected benefit obligation by approximately 16 million and 168 million respectively 

actuarial gains and losses in excess of 10 percent of the greater of the projected benefit obligation or marketrelated value of assets are amortized on a straightline basis over the average remaining service period of active participants prior service costs resulting from plan amendments are amortized in equal annual amounts over the average remaining service period of affected active participants or over the remaining life expectancy of affected retired participants see note 11 to the consolidated financial statements for further information on pension plans 

postretirement benefits snapon’s postretirement benefits obligation and related expense are calculated in accordance with us gaap and are impacted by certain actuarial assumptions including health care trend rates an increase of one percentage point in health care costs would increase the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation by 23 million and the combined annual service and interest cost by 01 million a corresponding decrease of one percentage point would decrease the accumulated postretirement benefit by 20 million and the combined annual service and interest cost by 01 million see note 12 to the consolidated financial statements for further information on postretirement plans 

income taxes snapon records deferred income tax assets and liabilities for differences between the book basis and tax basis of the related net assets snapon records a valuation allowance when appropriate to reduce its deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized while the company has considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance if these estimates and assumptions change in the future the company may be required to adjust its valuation allowance this could result in a charge to or an increase in income in the period such determination is made 

  

 

 

  

 

  

in addition the company operates within multiple taxing jurisdictions and is subject to audit in these jurisdictions the company records accruals for the estimated outcomes of these audits and the accruals may change in the future due to new developments in each matter see note 8 to the consolidated financial statements for further information on income taxes 

outlook 

snapon anticipates continuing with its planned strategic investments in 2011 including further expansion in emerging growth markets as a result capital expenditures are anticipated to be in a range of 55 million to 65 million snapon also expects to incur 11 million of higher yearoveryear pension expense in 2011 largely due to the amortization of investment losses incurred in 2008 related to its domestic pension plan assets interest expense on the 250 million of senior notes issued in december 2010 will approximate 27 million per quarter in 2011 snapon anticipates that its full year 2011 effective income tax rate will approximate 330 

  

 

 

  

 

  




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

market credit and economic risks 

market risk is the potential economic loss that may result from adverse changes in the fair value of financial instruments snapon is exposed to market risk from changes in both foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates snapon monitors its exposure to these risks and attempts to manage the underlying economic exposures through the use of financial instruments such as foreign currency forward contracts interest rate swap agreements and treasury lock agreements snapon does not use derivative instruments for speculative or trading purposes snapon’s broadbased business activities help to reduce the impact that volatility in any particular area or related areas may have on its operating earnings as a whole snapon’s management takes an active role in the risk management process and has developed policies and procedures that require specific administrative and business functions to assist in the identification assessment and control of various risks 

foreign currency risk management 

snapon has significant international operations and is subject to certain risks inherent with foreign operations that include currency fluctuations and restrictions on movement of funds foreign exchange risk exists to the extent that snapon has payment obligations or receipts denominated in currencies other than the functional currency to manage these exposures snapon identifies naturally offsetting positions and then purchases hedging instruments to protect the residual net exposures see note 10 to the consolidated financial statements for information on foreign currency risk management 

interest rate risk management 

snapon aims to control funding costs by managing the exposure created by the differing maturities and interest rate structures of snapon’s assets and liabilities through the use of interest rate swap agreements treasury lock agreements are used to manage potential changes in interest rates in anticipation of the issuance or sale of certain financial instruments see note 10 to the consolidated financial statements for information on interest rate risk management 

snapon utilizes a valueatrisk “var” model to determine the potential oneday loss in the fair value of its interest rate and foreign exchangesensitive financial instruments from adverse changes in market factors the var model estimates were made assuming normal market conditions and a 95 confidence level snapon’s computations are based on the interrelationships among movements in various currencies and interest rates variancecovariance technique these interrelationships were determined by observing interest rate and foreign currency market changes over the preceding quarter 

the estimated maximum potential oneday loss in fair value calculated using the var model as of 2010 year end was 54 million on interest ratesensitive financial instruments and 04 million on foreign currencysensitive financial instruments the var model is a risk management tool and does not purport to represent actual losses in fair value that will be incurred by snapon nor does it consider the potential effect of favorable changes in market factors 

credit risk 

credit risk is the possibility of loss from a customer’s failure to make payments according to contract terms prior to granting credit each customer is evaluated taking into consideration the borrower’s financial condition collateral debtservicing capacity past payment experience credit bureau information and other financial and qualitative factors that may affect the borrower’s ability to repay credit risk is also monitored regularly through the use of internal proprietary custom scoring models used to evaluate each transaction at the time of the application for credit and by periodically updating those credit scores for ongoing monitoring purposes snapon evaluates credit quality through the use of an internal proprietary measuring system that provides a framework to analyze finance and contract receivables on the basis of risk factors of the individual obligor as well as transaction specific risk loans that have been granted are typically monitored through an asset quality review process that closely monitors past due accounts and initiates a progressive collection action process when appropriate in addition to its direct credit risk exposure snapon also has credit risk exposure for certain socoriginated contracts with recourse provisions related to franchisee van loans sold by soc as of 2010 year end 159 million of franchisee van loans contain a recourse provision to snapon if the loans become more than 90 days past due 

  

 

 

  

 

  

counterparty risk 

snapon is exposed to credit losses in the event of nonperformance by the counterparties to various financial agreements including its foreign currency forward contracts interest rate swap agreements and treasury lock agreements snapon does not obtain collateral or other security to support financial instruments subject to credit risk but monitors the credit standing of the counterparties and enters into agreements only with financial institution counterparties with a credit rating of a or better snapon does not anticipate nonperformance by its counterparties but cannot provide assurances 

economic risk 

economic risk is the possibility of loss resulting from economic instability in certain areas of the world snapon continually monitors its exposure in these markets 

as a result of the above market credit and economic risks net income and revenues in any particular period may not be representative of fullyear results and may vary significantly from year to year inflation has not had a significant impact on the company 

commodity risk 

snapon is a purchaser of certain commodities such as steel natural gas and electricity the company is also a purchaser of components and parts that are integrated into the company’s end products as well as the purchaser of certain finished goods all of which may contain various commodities including steel aluminum and others snapon’s supply of raw materials and purchased components are generally and readily available from numerous suppliers 

the principal raw material used in the manufacture of the company’s products is steel which the company’s purchases in competitive pricesensitive markets to meet snapon’s high quality standards the company’s steel needs range from specialized alloys which are available only from a limited group of approved suppliers to commodity types of alloys these raw materials have historically exhibited price and demand cyclicality some of these materials have been and in the future may be in short supply as some steel alloys require specialized manufacturing procedures snapon could experience inventory shortages if it were required to use an alternative manufacturer on short notice additionally unexpected price increases could result in higher prices to snapon’s customers or an erosion of the margins on its products 

snapon believes its ability to sell product is also dependent on the number of vehicles on the road the number of miles driven and the general aging of vehicles these factors affect the frequency type and amount of service and repair performed on vehicles by technicians and therefore affect the demand for the number of technicians the prosperity of the technicians and subsequently the demand the technicians have for the company’s tools other products and services and the value they place on those products and services to the extent that the prices of gasoline and other petroleumbased fuels increase consumers may turn to other methods of transportation including more frequent use of public transportation a decrease in the use of privately operated vehicles may lead to fewer repairs and less demand for the company’s products 

to the extent that commodity prices increase and the company does not have firm pricing agreements with its suppliers the company may experience margin declines to the extent that it is not able to increase the selling prices of its products

sales and distribution 

snapon markets and distributes its products and related services principally to professional tool and equipment users around the world the two largest market sectors are the vehicle service and repair sector and the industrial sector 

vehicle service and repair sector 

the vehicle service and repair sector has three main customer groups i professional technicians who purchase tools and equipment for themselves ii vehicle service and repair shop owners and managers – including independent shops national chains and automotive dealerships – who purchase tools equipment and diagnostics products for use by multiple technicians within a service or repair facility and iii oems 

snapon provides innovative tool equipment and business solutions as well as technical sales support and training to meet technicians’ evolving needs snapon’s franchise van distribution system offers technicians the convenience of purchasing quality tools with minimal disruption of their work routine snapon also provides owners and managers of shops where technicians work with tools diagnostics equipment repair and service information including electronic parts catalogs and shop management products snapon’s oem facilitation business provides oems with products and services including tools consulting and facilitation services which include product procurement distribution and administrative support to customers for their dealership equipment programs 

major challenges for snapon and the vehicle service and repair sector include the increasing rate of technological change within motor vehicles vehicle population growth vehicle life and the resulting impact on the businesses of both our suppliers and customers that is necessitated by such change snapon believes it is a meaningful participant in the market sector for vehicle service and repair 

industrial sector 

snapon markets its products globally to a broad crosssection of industrial and commercial customers including maintenance and repair operations manufacturing and assembly facilities various government agencies facilities and operations including military operations vocational and technical schools aerospace and aviation oem and repair customers oil and gas developers mining operations energy and power generation equipment fabricators and operators agriculture infrastructure construction companies and other customers that require instrumentation service tools andor equipment for their products 

  

 

 

  

 

  

the industrial sector for snapon has achieved growth in recent years by providing valueadded products and services to an increasingly expanding global base of customers particularly those in the market segments of natural resources including power generation aerospace government and education through its experienced and dispersed sales organization industrial “solutioneers” strive to develop unique and highly valued productivity solutions for customers worldwide that leverage snapon’s product service and development capabilities 

major challenges in the industrial sector include a highly competitive costconscious environment and a trend toward customers making many of their tool and equipment purchases through one integrated supplier snapon believes it is a meaningful participant in the market sector for industrial tools and equipment 

distribution channels 

snapon serves customers primarily through the following channels of distribution the mobile van channel company direct sales distributors and ecommerce the following discussion summarizes snapon’s general approach for each channel and is not intended to be allinclusive 

mobile van channel 

in the united states the majority of sales to the vehicle service and repair sector are conducted through snapon’s franchise van channel snapon’s franchisees primarily serve vehicle service technicians and vehicle service shop owners generally providing weekly contact at the customer’s place of business franchisees’ sales are concentrated in hand and power tools tool storage products small diagnostic and shop equipment and diagnostics and repair information products which can easily be transported in a van and demonstrated during a brief sales call franchisees purchase snapon’s products at a discount from suggested list prices and resell them at prices established by the franchisee us franchisees are provided a list of places of business that serves as the basis of the franchisee’s sales route 

snapon also offers an option termed the “gateway program” to potential us franchisees that do not meet the franchise qualification requirements gateway program participants have less upfront investment and are provided an initial base level of consigned inventory from snapon to assist them in gaining experience and building equity toward the future purchase of a standard franchise snapon also provides certain franchisees the opportunity to add vans to their franchise or to add a limited number of additional franchises snapon charges nominal initial and ongoing monthly franchise fees since 1991 written franchise agreements have been entered into with all new us franchisees and most pre1991 independent franchisees at 2009 year end there were 3183 vans operated by us franchisees approximately 96 with written franchise agreements or individuals employed by such franchisees as compared with 3231 vans approximately 96 at 2008 year end 

snapon has replicated its us franchise van distribution model in certain other countries including australia canada germany japan the netherlands south africa and the united kingdom in many of these markets as in the united states purchase decisions are generally made or influenced by professional vehicle service technicians and shop owners 

through soc financing is available to us franchisees including financing for van and truck leases working capital loans and loans to enable new franchisees to fund the purchase of the franchise internationally snapon offers financing to its franchisees and customer networks through its wholly owned international finance subsidiaries the decision to finance through snapon or another financing entity is solely at the election of the customer 

snapon supports its franchisees with a field organization of regional offices franchise performance teams diagnostic sales developers “dsds” customer care centers and distribution centers snapon also provides sales and business training and marketing and product promotion programs as well as customer and franchisee financing programs through soc and its other wholly owned international finance subsidiaries all of which are designed to strengthen franchisee sales in the united states and canada the national franchise advisory council and the snapon tools canadian franchise advisory council both of which are composed primarily of franchisees that are elected by franchisees assist snapon in identifying and implementing enhancements to the franchise program 

in the united states franchisees work closely with the dsds the dsd specialists train franchisees on the sale of higherpricepoint diagnostics and demonstrate and sell vehicle service shop management and information systems dsds work independently and with franchisees to identify and generate sales among vehicle service technicians shop owners and managers dsds are snapon employees who beginning in 2008 are compensated through a combination of base salary and commission a franchisee receives a brokerage fee from certain sales made by the dsds to the franchisee’s customers most products sold through franchisees and the dsds are sold under the snapon bluepoint and sun brand names 

  

 

 

  

 

  

snapon also has a companyowned van program in the united states that is designed to i provide another pool of potential franchisees and field organization personnel ii service customers in select new andor open routes not currently serviced by franchisees and iii allow snapon to pilot new sales and promotional ideas prior to introducing them to franchisees as of 2009 year end companyowned vans comprised approximately 5 of the total us van population snapon may elect to increase the number of companyowned vans in the future 

company direct sales 

a significant proportion of shop equipment sales in the united states under the john bean and blackhawk brands diagnostic products under the snapon brand and information products under the mitchell1 brand are made by direct and independent sales forces that have responsibility for national and other accounts as the vehicle service and repair sector consolidates with more business conducted by national chains and franchised service centers the company believes these larger organizations can be serviced most effectively by sales people who can demonstrate and sell the full line of equipment and diagnostic products and services snapon also sells these products and services directly to oems and their franchised dealers 

snapon brand tools and equipment are marketed to industrial and governmental customers in the united states through both industrial sales representatives who are employees and independent industrial distributors in most markets outside the united states industrial sales are conducted through independent distributors the sales representatives focus on industrial customers whose main purchase criteria are quality and service at the end of 2009 snapon had industrial sales representatives in the united states including puerto rico australia canada japan mexico and some european asian latin american and middle eastern countries with the united states representing the majority of snapon’s total industrial sales 

the company also sells automotive power equipment and power sports software solutions both domestically and internationally through an internal sales force products and services are marketed to two targeted groups oems and individual dealerships to effectively reach the large oems in the automotive segment such as general motors company daimler ag ford motor company new chrysler group llc and toyota motor corporation the company has deployed a team of business development professionals in the world’s principal automotive centers in the united states the united kingdom germany italy france spain and japan in the united states and canada automotive products and services are sold directly to individual dealerships using an experienced sales force in reaching customers such as john deere deere  company jc bamford excavators ltd jcb and yamaha corporation of america yamaha in the power equipment and power sports segments teams are also positioned to support the 90 brands that snapon distributes to globally business management solutions are sold directly to the automotive oems in the united states and throughout europe including the united kingdom 

distributors 

sales of certain tools and equipment are made through independent distributors who purchase the items from snapon and resell them to end users hand tools under the bahco fish and hook and lindström brands and trade names for example are sold through distributors in europe north and south america asia and certain other parts of the world wheel service and other vehicle service equipment are sold through distributors primarily under brands including hofmann john bean cartec and blackhawk diagnostics and equipment are marketed through distributors in south america and asia and through both a direct sales force and distributors in europe under the snapon sun and bahco brands

snapon’s ecommerce development initiatives allow snapon to combine the capabilities of the internet with snapon’s existing brand sales and distribution strengths to reach new and underserved customer segments snapon offers current and prospective customers online aroundtheclock access to purchase products through its public internet web site at wwwsnaponcom  the site features an online catalog containing nearly 14000 products including snapon hand tools power tools tool storage units and diagnostic equipment available to consumers and professionals in the united states the united kingdom canada and australia at the end of 2009 snapon had more than 600000 registered users including approximately 43000 industrial accounts ecommerce and certain other system enhancement initiatives are designed to improve productivity and further leverage the oneonone relationships and service snapon has with its current and prospective customers through businesstobusiness and businesstoconsumer capabilities snapon and its franchisees are enhancing communications with customers on a realtime 24hour 7day a week basis 

  

 

 

  

 

  

competition 

snapon competes on the basis of its product quality and performance product line breadth and depth service brand awareness and imagery and technological innovation while no single company competes with snapon across all of its product lines and distribution channels various companies compete in one or more product categories andor distribution channels 

snapon believes it is a leading manufacturer and distributor of professional tools diagnostics equipment repair software and solutions offering the broadest line of these products to the vehicle service industry the major competitors selling to professional technicians in the automotive service and repair sector through the mobile van channel include mac tools the stanley works matco danaher corporation and cornwell snapon also competes with companies that sell tools and equipment to automotive technicians through retail stores and online including craftsman sears brands llc ridgid and husky the home depot inc and kobalt lowes companies inc auto parts supply outlets such as napa autozone inc and pep boys and tool supply warehousesdistributorships such as medco and integrated supply network inc isn within the power tools category snapon’s major competitors include ingersollrand co limited the black  decker corporation makita corporation chicago pneumatic atlas copco and milwaukee electric techtronic industries co ltd in the industrial sector major competitors include facom tools and proto the stanley works armstrong danaher corporation irwin newell rubbermaid inc cooper industries ltd and westward ww grainger inc the major competitors selling diagnostics and shop equipment and information to automotive dealerships independent repair shop owners and managers in the vehicle service and repair sector include corghi spa fluke and hennessy danaher corporation robinair and otc spx corporation hunter engineering rotary lift and chief automotive dover corporation caroliner ab lexcom gmbh infomedia ltd enigma alldata autozone inc and the proprietary electronic parts catalog diagnostic and information systems of oems 

raw materials and purchased product 

snapon’s supply of raw materials and purchased components are generally and readily available from numerous suppliers snapon believes it has secured an ample supply of both bar and coil steel for the near future to ensure stable supply to meet material demands the company does not anticipate experiencing any significant steel pricing or availability issues in 2010 

patents trademarks and other intellectual property 

snapon vigorously pursues and relies on patent protection to protect its intellectual property and its position in its markets at 2009 year end snapon and its subsidiaries held over 740 active and pending patents in the united states and over 1330 active and pending patents outside of the united states sales relating to any single patent did not represent a material portion of snapon’s revenues in the last three years 

examples of products that have features or designs that benefit from patent protection include wheel alignment systems wheel balancers tire changers lifts test lanes sealed ratchets electronic torque instruments ratcheting screwdrivers emissionssensing devices and diagnostic equipment 

much of the technology used in the manufacture of vehicle service tools and equipment is in the public domain snapon relies primarily on trade secret protection to protect proprietary processes used in manufacturing methods and processes are patented when appropriate copyright protection is also utilized when appropriate 

trademarks used by snapon are of continuing importance to snapon in the marketplace trademarks have been registered in the united states and more than 100 other countries and additional applications for trademark registrations are pending snapon vigorously polices proper use of its trademarks snapon’s right to manufacture and sell certain products is dependent upon licenses from others however these products under license do not represent a material portion of snapon’s net sales 

  

 

 

  

 

  

domain names have become a valuable corporate asset for companies around the world including snapon domain names often contain a trademark or service mark or even a corporate name and are often considered intellectual property the recognition and value of the snapon name trademark and domain name are core strengths of the company 

snapon is selectively and strategically licensing the snapon brand to carefully selected manufacturing and distribution companies for items such as apparel work boots lighting and a variety of other goods in order to further build equity and market presence for the company’s strongest brand 

environment 

snapon is subject to various environmental laws ordinances regulations and other requirements of government authorities in the united states and other nations at snapon these environmental liabilities are managed through the snapon environmental hygiene and safety management system “eh  sms” which is applied worldwide the system is based upon continual improvement and is certified to iso 140012004 and ohsas 180012007 verified through det norske veritas dnv certification inc 

snapon believes that it complies with applicable environmental control requirements in its operations expenditures on environmental matters through eh  sms have not had and snapon does not for the foreseeable future expect them to have a material effect upon snapon’s capital expenditures earnings or competitive position 

employees 

at the end of january 2010 snapon employed approximately 11000 people as compared to approximately 11500 people at the end of january 2009 

approximately 2650 employees or 24 of snapon’s worldwide workforce are represented by unions andor covered under collective bargaining agreements approximately 1100 employees are covered under agreements expiring in 2010 in recent years snapon has not experienced any significant work slowdowns stoppages or other labor disruptions 

the number of covered union employees whose contracts expire within the next five years approximates 1100 employees in 2010 700 employees in 2011 and 175 employees in 2012 there are no contracts currently scheduled to expire in 2013 there are approximately 200 employees whose contract is scheduled to expire in 2014 

there can be no assurance that future contracts with snapon’s unions will be renegotiated upon terms acceptable to snapon 

working capital 

most of snapon’s businesses are not seasonal and their inventory needs are relatively constant as a result of the termination of the joint venture with cit on july 16 2009 the company used its working capital in 2009 to fund in part the growth of the onbook receivables originated by soc snapon did not have a significant backlog of orders at 2009 year end 

snapon’s liquidity and capital resources and use of working capital are discussed herein in “item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” 

at 2009 year end neither snapon nor any of its segments depend on any single customer small group of customers or government for any material part of its revenues prior to july 16 2009 snapon’s financial services segment depended on cit for more than 10 of its revenues 




 item 1a risk factors 

in evaluating the company careful consideration should be given to the following risk factors in addition to the other information included in this annual report on form 10k including the consolidated financial statements and the related notes each of these risk factors could adversely affect the company’s business operating results cash flows andor financial condition as well as adversely affect the value of an investment in the company’s common stock 

  

 

 

  

 

  

economic conditions and world events could affect our operating results 

we our franchisees and our customers may continue to be adversely affected by ongoing weakness in or worsening of economic conditions these conditions may result in reduced consumer and investor confidence instability in the credit and financial markets volatile corporate profits and reduced business and consumer spending we our franchisees and our customers and the economy as a whole also may be affected by future world events such as acts of terrorism developments in the war on terrorism conflicts in international situations the impact of epidemics on business and by natural disasters these factors may affect our results of operations by reducing our sales margins andor net income as a result of a slowdown in customer orders or order cancellations in addition political and social turmoil related to international conflicts and terrorist acts may put further pressure on economic conditions abroad unstable political social and economic conditions may make it difficult for our franchisees customers suppliers and us to accurately forecast and plan future business activities if such conditions persist our business financial condition results of operations and cash flow could be negatively affected 

foreign operations are subject to currency exchange political economic and other risks that could adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flow 

the reporting currency for snapon’s consolidated financial statements is the us dollar certain of the company’s assets liabilities expenses and revenues are denominated in currencies other than the us dollar in preparing the company’s consolidated financial statements those assets liabilities expenses and revenues are translated into us dollars at applicable exchange rates increases or decreases in exchange rates between the us dollar and those other currencies affect the us dollar value of those items as reflected in the company’s consolidated financial statements substantial fluctuations in the value of the us dollar could have a significant impact on the company’s financial condition and results of operations 

approximately 41 of our revenues in 2009 were generated outside of the united states future growth rates and success of our business depends in large part on continued growth in our nonus operations including growth in emerging markets numerous risks and uncertainties affect our nonus operations these risks and uncertainties include political economic and social instability such as acts of war civil disturbance or acts of terrorism local labor conditions changes in government policies and regulations including imposition or increases in withholding and other taxes on remittances and other payments by international subsidiaries transportation delays or interruptions and difficulties in enforcement of contract and intellectual property rights in 2009 certain of our europeanbased businesses were significantly impacted by the economic downturn that particularly affected various markets in europe should the economic environment in these markets deteriorate from 2009 levels our results of operations and financial position could be materially impacted including as a result of the effects of potential impairment writedowns of goodwill andor other intangible assets related to these businesses 

we are also affected by changes in inflation rates and interest rates additionally cash generated in nonus jurisdictions may be difficult to repatriate to the united states in a taxefficient manner our foreign operations are also subject to other risks and challenges such as the need to staff and manage diverse workforces respond to the needs of multiple national and international marketplaces and differing business climates and cultures in various countries 

the performance of snapon’s mobile van tool distribution business depends on the success of its franchisees 

approximately 41 of our 2009 revenues were generated by the snapon tools group which consists of snapon’s business operations serving the worldwide van channel except in limited circumstances each of our mobile tool vans is operated by a franchisee pursuant to a franchise agreement snapon’s success is dependent on its relationships with franchisees individually and collectively as they are the primary sales and service link between the company and vehicle service and repair technicians who are an important class of end users for snapon’s products and services if our franchisees are not successful or if we do not maintain an effective relationship with our franchisees the delivery of products the collection of receivables andor our relationship with end users could be adversely affected and thereby negatively impact our business financial condition results of operations and cash flow 

  

 

 

  

 

  

in addition if we are unable to maintain effective relationships with franchisees the company or the franchisees may choose to terminate the relationship which may result in i open routes in which enduse customers are not provided reliable service ii litigation resulting from termination iii reduced collections or increased writeoffs of franchisee receivables owed to snapon andor iv reduced collections or increased writeoffs of extended credit contracts and to a lesser extent lease contracts that are collected by franchisees on behalf of soc as snapon has approximately 4800 franchisees worldwide and most of these franchise relationships are governed by contract it is not uncommon for litigation to result from the termination of these relationships 

the effects of brand rationalization dealership closures andor financial difficulties in the automotive industry could impact our business and operating results 

some of our business units have substantial interrelationships with the automotive industry substantial and continued weakness in the automotive industry has resulted in the bankruptcy of certain automobile manufacturers as well as suppliers and dealers who are dependent upon them the ongoing effects of these bankruptcies and related reorganizations cannot yet be fully determined these factors have already resulted in a reduction in the number of automobile dealerships and could result in further reductions through consolidations or as a result of changes in the automakers or their manner of conducting business additionally the weakness of companies in that industry could affect their levels of purchases from us and the collectibility of amounts owed to us even though we believe that our products and services enhance productivity a reduction in the number of automotive manufacturers andor dealers or their capital expenditures could substantially affect our sales any of those factors could negatively affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flow 

raw material and energy price fluctuations and shortages including steel and various fuel sources could adversely affect the ability to obtain needed manufacturing materials and could adversely affect our results of operations 

the principal raw material used in the manufacture of our products is steel which we purchase in competitive pricesensitive markets to meet snapon’s high quality standards our steel needs range from specialized alloys which are available only from a limited group of approved suppliers to commodity types of alloys these raw materials have historically exhibited price and demand fluctuations of a cyclical nature some of these materials have been and in the future may be in short supply as some steel alloys require specialized manufacturing procedures we could experience inventory shortages if we were required to use an alternative manufacturer on short notice additionally unexpected price increases for other raw materials could result in higher prices to our customers or an erosion of the margins on our products 

we believe our ability to sell our products is also dependent on the number of vehicles on the road the number of miles driven and the general aging of vehicles these factors affect the frequency type and amount of service and repair performed on vehicles by technicians and therefore affect the demand for the number of technicians the prosperity of the technicians and subsequently the demand technicians have for our tools other products and services and the value technicians place on those products and services to the extent that gasoline prices increase consumers may turn to other nongasoline based methods of transportation including more frequent use of public transportation a decrease in the use of gasoline consuming vehicles may lead to fewer repairs and less demand for our products 

we use various energy sources to transport produce and distribute products and some of our products have components that are petroleum based petroleum and energy prices have recently been volatile and have periodically increased significantly over short periods of time further volatility and changes may be caused by market fluctuations supply and demand currency fluctuation production and transportation disruption world events and changes in governmental programs energy price increases raise both our operating costs and the costs of our materials and we may not be able to increase our prices enough to offset these costs higher prices also may reduce the level of future customer orders and our profitability 

our inability to provide acceptable financing alternatives to enduser customers and franchisees could adversely impact our operating results 

an integral component of our business and profitability is our ability to offer financing alternatives to enduser customers and franchisees following the july 16 2009 termination of our joint venture arrangement with cit snapon is now providing the resources for the majority of this financing as a result we are more dependent upon our ability to obtain capital resources or other financing on terms that we believe are attractive to support soc’s onbook receivables the lack of our ability to obtain capital resources or financing whether resulting from the state of the financial markets our own operating performance or other factors would negatively affect our operating results and financial condition adverse fluctuations in interest rates andor our ability to provide competitive financing programs for other reasons could also have an adverse impact on our revenue and profitability 

  

 

 

  

 

  

exposure to credit risks of customers and resellers may make it difficult to collect receivables and could adversely affect operating results and financial condition 

industry and economic conditions have the potential to weaken the financial position of some of our customers if circumstances surrounding our customers’ financial capabilities were to deteriorate such writedowns or writeoffs would negatively affect our operating results for the period in which they occur and if large could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flow 

regulatory changes related to financial services operations could adversely affect operating results and financial condition 

financial services operations of all kinds are becoming subject to increasing regulation in addition to potentially increasing the costs of doing business new laws and regulations or changes to existing laws and regulations may affect the relationships between creditors and debtors or inhibit the rights of creditors to collect amounts owed to them for example if such changes impede our ability to collect amounts that are due to us or limit the rates we can charge our profitability would suffer 

instability and uncertainty in the credit and financial markets could adversely impact the availability of credit that we and our customers need to operate our businesses 

we depend upon the availability of credit to operate our business including the financing of receivables from enduser customers that are originated by soc our enduser customers franchisees and suppliers also require access to credit for their businesses instability and uncertainty in the credit and financial markets could adversely impact the availability of future financing and the terms on which it might be available to snapon its enduser customers franchisees and suppliers inability to access credit markets or a deterioration in the terms on which financing might be available could have an adverse impact on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flow 

we have increased our financial leverage which could affect our operations and profitability 

over the past several years we have increased our use of borrowed funds primarily to finance acquisitions and most recently to fund the receivables of soc the company’s increased leverage may affect both our availability of additional capital resources in the future as well as our operations in several ways including 

 

     while we believe we will have the ability to service our debt and obtain additional resources in the future if and when needed that will depend upon our results of operations and financial position at the time the thencurrent state of the credit and financial markets and other factors that may be beyond our control therefore we cannot give assurances that credit will be available on terms that we consider attractive or at all if and when necessary or beneficial to us 

failure to achieve expected investment returns on pension plan assets as well as changes in interest rates could adversely impact our results of operations financial position and cash flow 

snapon sponsors various defined benefit pension plans “pension plans” the assets of the pension plans are broadly diversified in an attempt to mitigate the risk of a large loss the assets are invested in equity securities fixed income securities real estate and other real assets other alternative investments and cash required funding for the company’s defined benefit pension plans is determined in accordance with guidelines set forth in the federal employee retirement income security act erisa additional contributions to enhance the funded status of the pension plans can be made at the company’s discretion however there can be no assurance that the value of the pension plan assets or the investment returns on those plan assets will be sufficient to meet the future benefit obligations of such plans in addition during periods of adverse investment market conditions and declining interest rates the company may be required to make additional cash contributions to the plans that could reduce our financial flexibility 

  

 

 

  

 

  

our pension plan obligations are affected by changes in market interest rates significant fluctuations in market interest rates have added and may further add volatility to our pension plan obligations declining market interest rates will increase our pension plan obligations while our plan assets are broadly diversified there are inherent market risks associated with investments our pension plan assets in the aggregate incurred a substantial loss in recent periods as a result of market conditions if further adverse market conditions occur our plan assets could incur additional losses since we may need to make additional contributions to address an increase in obligations andor a loss in plan assets the combination of declining market interest rates andor past or future plan asset investment losses could adversely impact our financial position results of operations and cash flows 

the company’s pension plan expense is comprised of the following factors i service cost ii interest on projected benefit obligations iii the expected return on plan assets iv the amortization of prior service costs and v the effects of actuarial gains and losses the accounting for pensions involves the estimation of a number of factors that are highly uncertain certain factors such as the interest cost and the expected return on plan assets are impacted by changes in market interest rates and the value of plan assets a significant decrease in market interest rates and a decrease in the fair value of plan assets would increase net pension expense and may adversely affect the company’s future results of operations see note 11 to the consolidated financial statements for further information on the company’s pension plans 

the steps taken to restructure operations rationalize operating footprint lower operating expenses and achieve greater efficiencies in the supply chain could disrupt business 

we have taken steps in the past and expect to take additional steps in 2010 intended to improve customer service and to drive further efficiencies and reduce costs some of which could be disruptive to our business these actions collectively across our operating groups are focused on the following 

 

       we believe that by executing on these focus areas along with a continued commitment to new innovative products and rci initiatives to drive higher levels of productivity and lower costs the company and its franchisees may realize stronger growth and profitability however failure to succeed in the implementation of any or all of these actions could result in an inability to achieve our financial goals and could be disruptive to the business 

in addition reductions to headcount and other cost reduction measures may result in the loss of technical expertise that could adversely affect our research and development efforts and ability to meet product development schedules efforts to reduce components of expense could result in the recording of charges for inventory and technologyrelated writeoffs workforce reduction costs or other charges relating to the consolidation of facilities if we were to incur a substantial charge to further these efforts our earnings per share would be adversely affected in such period if we are unable to effectively manage our cost reduction and restructuring efforts our business financial condition results of operations and cash flow could be negatively affected 

failure to maintain effective distribution of products and services could adversely impact revenue gross margin and profitability 

we use a variety of distribution methods to sell our products and services successfully managing the interaction of our distribution efforts to reach various potential customer segments for our products and services is a complex process moreover since each distribution method has distinct risks costs and gross margins our failure to implement the most advantageous balance in the delivery model for our products and services could adversely affect our revenue and gross margins and therefore our profitability 

  

 

 

  

 

  

risks associated with the disruption of manufacturing operations could adversely affect profitability or competitive position 

we manufacture a significant portion of the products we sell any prolonged disruption in the operations of our existing manufacturing facilities whether due to technical or labor difficulties lack of raw material or component availability destruction of or damage to any facility as a result of natural disasters use and storage of hazardous materials or other events or other reasons could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flow 

the inability to continue to introduce new products that respond to customer needs and achieve market acceptance could result in lower revenues and reduced profitability 

sales from new products represent a significant portion of our net sales and are expected to continue to represent a significant component of our future net sales we may not be able to compete effectively unless we continue to enhance existing products or introduce new products to the marketplace in a timely manner product improvements and new product introductions require significant financial and other resources including significant planning design development and testing at the technological product and manufacturing process levels our competitors’ new products may beat our products to market be more effective with more features be less expensive than our products andor render our products obsolete any new products that we develop may not receive market acceptance or otherwise generate any meaningful net sales or profits for us relative to our expectations based on among other things existing and anticipated investments in manufacturing capacity and commitments to fund advertising marketing promotional programs and research and development 

the global tool equipment and diagnostics and repair information industries are competitive 

we face strong competition in all of our market segments price competition in our various industries is intense and pricing pressures from competitors and customers are increasing in general as a manufacturer and marketer of premium products and services the expectations of snapon’s customers and its franchisees are high and increasing any inability to maintain customer satisfaction could diminish snapon’s premium image and reputation and could result in a lessening of its ability to command premium pricing we expect that the level of competition will remain high in the future which could limit our ability to maintain or increase market share or profitability 

product liability claims and litigation could affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flow 

the products that we design andor manufacture can lead to product liability claims being filed against us to the extent that plaintiffs are successful in showing that defects in the design or manufacture of our products led to personal injury or property damage we may be subject to claims for damages although we are insured for damages above a certain amount we bear the costs and expenses associated with defending claims including frivolous lawsuits and are responsible for damages below the insurance retention amount as a manufacturer we can be subject to the costs and potential negative publicity of product recalls which could impact our results 

legal disputes could adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flow 

from time to time we are subject to legal disputes that are being litigated andor settled in the ordinary course of business for example as described more fully below in “item 3 legal proceedings” snapon has a dispute pending in arbitration with cit in which both parties make claims relating to matters that occurred during the course of their joint venture that dispute and any other dispute or future lawsuit could result in the diversion of management’s time and attention away from business operations additionally negative developments with respect to legal disputes and the costs incurred in defending ourselves could have an adverse impact on us adverse outcomes or settlements could also require us to pay damages potentially in excess of amounts reserved or incur liability for other remedies that could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

information technology infrastructure is critical to supporting business objectives failure of our information technology infrastructure to operate effectively could adversely affect our business 

we depend heavily on information technology infrastructure to achieve our business objectives if a problem occurs that impairs this infrastructure the resulting disruption could impede our ability to record or process orders manufacture and ship in a timely manner or otherwise carry on business in the normal course any such events could cause us to lose customers or revenue and could require us to incur significant expense to remediate 

  

 

 

  

 

  

in association with initiatives to better integrate business units rationalize operating footprint and improve responsiveness to franchisees and customers snapon is continually replacing and enhancing its existing global enterprise resource planning erp management information systems as we integrate implement and deploy new information technology processes and a common information infrastructure across our global operations we could experience disruptions in our business that could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flow 

the recognition of impairment charges on goodwill or other intangible assets would adversely impact future financial position and results of operations 

we are required to perform impairment tests on our goodwill and other intangibles annually or at any time when events occur that could impact the value of our business segments our determination of whether impairment has occurred is based on a comparison of each of our reporting units’ fair market value with its carrying value significant and unanticipated changes in circumstances such as significant adverse changes in business climate adverse actions by regulators unanticipated competition loss of key customers including large customers associated with the automotive industry andor changes in technology or markets could require a provision for impairment in a future period that could substantially impact our reported earnings and reduce our consolidated net worth and shareholders’ equity in 2009 certain of our europeanbased businesses were significantly impacted by the economic downturn that particularly affected various markets in europe should the economic environment in these markets deteriorate from 2009 levels our results of operations and financial position could be materially impacted including as a result of the effects of potential impairment writedowns of goodwill andor other intangible assets related to these businesses 

failure to adequately protect intellectual property could adversely affect our business 

intellectual property rights are an important and integral component of our business we attempt to protect our intellectual property rights through a combination of patent trademark copyright and trade secret laws as well as licensing agreements and thirdparty nondisclosure and assignment agreements adverse determinations in a judicial or administrative proceeding could prevent us from manufacturing and selling our products or prevent us from stopping others from manufacturing and selling competing products failure to obtain or maintain adequate protection of our intellectual property rights for any reason could have a material adverse effect on our business 

our operations expose us to the risk of environmental liabilities costs litigation and violations that could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and reputation 

certain of our operations are subject to environmental laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which they operate which impose limitations on the discharge of pollutants into the ground air and water and establish standards for the generation treatment use storage and disposal of hazardous wastes we must also comply with various health and safety regulations in the united states and abroad in connection with our operations failure to comply with any of these laws could result in civil and criminal monetary and nonmonetary penalties and damage to our reputation in addition we may incur costs related to remedial efforts or alleged environmental damage associated with past or current waste disposal practices we cannot provide assurance that our costs of complying with current or future environmental protection and health and safety laws will not exceed our estimates 

the inability to successfully defend claims from taxing authorities could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flow 

we conduct business in many countries which requires us to interpret the income tax laws and rulings in each of those taxing jurisdictions due to the subjectivity of tax laws between those jurisdictions as well as the subjectivity of factual interpretations our estimates of income tax liabilities may differ from actual payments or assessments claims from taxing authorities related to these differences could have an adverse impact on our financial condition results of operations and cash flow 

failure to attract and retain qualified personnel could lead to a loss of revenue andor profitability 

snapon’s success depends in part on the efforts and abilities of its senior management team and other key employees their skills experience and industry contacts significantly benefit our operations and administration the failure to attract and retain members of our senior management team and other key employees could have a negative effect on our operating results in addition transitions of important responsibilities to new individuals inherently include the possibility of disruptions to our business and operations which could negatively affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flow 

  

 

 

  

 

  

we may not successfully integrate businesses we acquire which could have an adverse impact on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flow 

the pursuit of future growth through acquisitions including participation in joint ventures involves significant risks that could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flow these risks include

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

management overview 

unless otherwise indicated references in this management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations to “fiscal 2009” or “2009” refer to the fiscal year ended january 2 2010 references to “fiscal 2008” or “2008” refer to the fiscal year ended january 3 2009 references to “fiscal 2007” or “2007” refer to the fiscal year ended december 29 2007 references to “year end” 2009 2008 and 2007 refer to january 2 2010 january 3 2009 and december 29 2007 respectively 

the economic slowdown and tightened credit environment that began in 2008 continued into 2009 as customers curtailed spending in response to the worsening global recession despite the challenges of the ongoing recession we continued investing in and even accelerated certain of our strategic growth initiatives aimed at strengthening our business models pursuing geographic and customer diversification expanding our presence in emerging markets and driving value creation processes including innovation and rapid continuous improvement described below we continue to believe that the advancement of these strategic initiatives will help create an environment to achieve longterm value for company shareholders associates franchisees and other distributor partners across our varied business segments and channels 

net sales in 2009 of 23625 million decreased 4908 million or 172 from 2008 levels with unfavorable currency translation contributing 985 million or 200 of the sales decline operating earnings of 2507 million in 2009 decreased 1381 million from 2008 levels primarily due to the lower sales volumes in 2009 operating earnings contributions from the company’s ongoing efficiency and productivity collectively “rapid continuous improvement” or “rci” initiatives and other cost reduction activities including benefits from restructuring material cost reductions and savings from cost containment actions more than offset the impacts of costs to carry manufacturing capacity in light of lower demand and inventory reduction efforts unfavorable currency effects lower financial services income and higher yearoveryear restructuring costs 

on july 16 2009 snapon terminated its joint venture agreement with cit group inc “cit” relating to the parties’ snapon credit llc “soc” financial services joint venture and subsequently purchased cit’s 50ownership interest in the joint venture for 81 million pursuant to the terms of the joint venture agreement since july 16 2009 snapon is providing financing for the majority of new loans originated by soc and soc is recording the interest yield on the new onbook receivables over the life of the contracts previously soc sold new contract originations to cit and recorded gains on the sale of the contracts as financial services revenue the change from recognizing gains on contract sales to cit to recognizing the interest yield on the onbook receivables was a primary factor in the yearoveryear decline in both financial services revenues and operating earnings as a result of this change snapon anticipates that financial services revenue and operating income will through the second quarter of 2010 decline compared to prioryear periods as the company builds its portfolio of onbook finance receivables snapon expects that operating income from financial services will improve as the onbook finance portfolio grows 

in response to the global economic challenges we accelerated certain rci and other strategic initiatives in 2009 including those planned investments that we see as potentially enabling nearterm growth such as the further expansion of our manufacturing capacity in china and eastern europe in 2010 we intend to aggressively manage the balance between investing and capturing growth opportunities with the need for additional cost reduction actions beyond those already implemented or planned in 2009 we experienced adverse effects from foreign currency exchange rate movements given our increasingly global footprint foreign currency rates could continue to have a more pronounced effect on our sales and operating profit comparisons 

our strategic priorities and plans for 2010 will continue to build on the improvement initiatives underway to achieve sustainable profitable growth global market conditions in 2010 however may affect the level and timing of resources deployed in pursuit of these initiatives 

in the commercial  industrial group  segment net sales in 2009 of 10838 million were down 231 from 2008 levels primarily as a result of the economic downturn that particularly impacted sales volumes in various european markets excluding 639 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation organic excluding foreign currency translation effects sales in 2009 declined 2616 million or 194 year over year operating earnings of 483 million in 2009 declined 1190 million from 2008 levels as the impacts of lower sales costs to carry manufacturing capacity in light of lower demand and inventory reduction efforts primarily in europe and higher restructuring costs were only partially offset by 523 million of savings from ongoing rci and restructuring initiatives including savings from cost containment actions the commercial  industrial group incurred 182 million of restructuring costs in 2009 primarily to improve the segment’s cost structure in europe 

  

 

 

 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued 

 

 

 

  

the commercial  industrial group intends to build on the following strategic priorities in 2010 

 

    in the snapon tools group  progress continued on fundamental strategic initiatives to strengthen the group and enhance franchisee profitability and satisfaction 

segment net sales of 9985 million in 2009 declined 1055 million or 96 from 2008 levels primarily due to the continued challenging global economy excluding 237 million of unfavorable currency translation organic sales declined 76 however supply chain improvements and an ongoing transition to a marketdemandbased replenishment system continued to improve complete and ontime delivery of a broad assortment of products in 2009 operating earnings in 2009 of 1108 million declined 69 million from 2008 levels as the impacts of the lower sales and 209 million of unfavorable currency effects were largely offset by 435 million of savings from ongoing rci and other cost reduction initiatives including benefits from restructuring material cost reductions and savings from cost containment actions 

the snapon tools group intends to continue to build on the progress made in enhancing the franchise proposition and delivering customer productivity solutions with specific initiatives in 2010 focused on the following 

 

     by executing in these areas we believe that we as well as our franchisees will continue to serve more customers better and more profitably 

in the diagnostics  information group  segment net sales of 5306 million in 2009 declined 972 million or 155 from 2008 levels while operating earnings in 2009 increased 65 million year over year to 1194 million the increase in operating earnings primarily reflects the impacts of a more favorable sales mix of highermargin diagnostics and software products despite the lower sales and 248 million of savings from ongoing rci and other cost reduction initiatives including savings from cost containment actions 

the improved sales mix of diagnostics and mitchell1 information products in 2009 benefited from the development and launch of new products and the continued expansion of functionality content and product integration sales of the company’s electronic parts catalogs to original equipment manufacturers “oems” and their franchised dealer networks declined from 2008 levels primarily due to lower nonrecurring hardware training and installation revenue resulting from the completion of a major multiyear deployment in 2008 and the impact of automotive dealership closures in north america fewer major essential tool distribution programs by oems in north america and the impact of the wind down of a major facilitation program in europe also impacted 2009 sales in addition many oem dealerships delayed capital investment programs in 2009 as they evaluated the impacts of the substantial and continued weakness in the automotive industry despite lower yearoveryear sales the 2006 acquisition of snapon business solutions continues to provide a strong base for relationships with key oem customers strengthening our position as a provider of essential productivity solutions 

  

 

 

  

 

  

the diagnostics  information group intends to focus on the following strategic priorities in 2010 

 

     financial services revenue and operating earnings in 2009 decreased to 583 million and 175 million respectively financial services revenue and operating earnings in 2008 totaled 814 million and 373 million respectively as discussed above on july 16 2009 snapon terminated its financial services joint venture agreement with cit since july 16 2009 snapon is providing financing for the majority of new loans originated by soc and soc is recording the interest yield on the new onbook receivables over the life of the contracts as financial services revenue previously soc sold new contract originations to cit and recorded gains on the sale of the contracts as financial services revenue the decrease in yearoveryear financial services revenue and operating earnings is primarily due to the change from recognizing gains on contract sales to cit to recognizing the interest yield on the onbook receivables originations of 4981 million in 2009 decreased 126 million or 25 from 2008 levels 

financial services intends to focus on the following strategic priorities in 2010 

 

    cash flows 

net cash provided from operating activities was 3471 million in 2009 as compared to 2204 million in 2008 the 1267 million increase in cash flow from operating activities in 2009 resulted primarily from net changes in operating assets and liabilities partially offset by lower 2009 net earnings 

net cash used by investing activities of 2417 million in 2009 included additions to and collections of finance receivables of 2655 million and 820 million respectively following the july 2009 termination of the financial services joint venture agreement with cit capital expenditures in 2009 of 644 million included continued spending to support the company’s strategic growth initiatives including the expansion of manufacturing capabilities in emerging growth markets and lowercost regions capital expenditures in 2009 also included spending to complete the construction of a new headquarters and research and development facility for the company’s automotive parts and service information business which was completed in the fourth quarter subsequent to the july 16 2009 termination of the financial services joint venture agreement with cit snapon acquired cit’s 50ownership interest in soc for 81 million 

net cash provided by financing activities totaled 4756 million in 2009 in 2009 snapon issued 550 million of unsecured fixed rate longterm notes snapon is using the 5459 million of net proceeds from the sale of these notes for general corporate purposes including the funding of receivables contracts originated by soc and the repayment of 150 million of floating rate debt on january 12 2010 cash dividends paid to shareholders totaled 690 million in 2009 the company did not repurchase any shares of its common stock in 2009 

  

 

 

 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued 

 

 

 

  

results of operations 

2009 vs 2008 

results of operations for 2009 and 2008 are as follows

revenue recognition snapon recognizes revenue from the sale of tools diagnostics and equipment solutions when contract terms are met collectibility is reasonably assured and a product is shipped or risk of ownership has been transferred to and accepted by the customer for sales contingent upon customer acceptance or product installation revenue recognition is deferred until such obligations are fulfilled estimated product returns are recorded as a reduction in reported revenues at the time of sale based upon historical product return experience and gross profit margin adjusted for known trends provisions for customer volume rebates discounts and allowances are also recorded as a reduction of reported revenues at the time of sale based on historical experience and known trends revenue related to maintenance and subscription agreements is recognized over the terms of the respective agreements 

snapon also recognizes revenue related to multiple element arrangements including sales of software and softwarerelated services when a sales arrangement contains multiple elements such as hardware and software products andor services snapon uses vendor specific objective evidence “vsoe” of fair value to allocate revenue to each element based on its relative fair value and when necessary uses the residual method to assign value to the delivered elements when vsoe only exists for the undelivered elements snapon limits the amount of revenue recognition for delivered elements to the amount that is not contingent on the future delivery of products or services the amount assigned to future delivery of products or services is recognized when the product is delivered andor when the services are performed in instances where the product andor services are performed over an extended period as is the case with subscription agreements or the providing of ongoing support revenue is generally recognized on a straightline basis over the term of the applicable agreement which generally ranges from 12 to 60 months 

franchise fee revenue including nominal nonrefundable initial and ongoing monthly fees primarily for sales and business training and marketing and product promotion programs is recognized as the fees are earned 

financial services revenue snapon also generates revenue from various financing programs that include i loans to franchisees ii loans to franchisees’ customers and iii loans to snapon’s industrial and other customers for the purchase of tools and equipment and diagnostics products on an extendedterm payment plan these financing programs are offered through snapon’s wholly owned finance subsidiaries financial services revenue consists of installment contract revenue and franchisee loan receivable revenue for periods prior to july 16 2009 financial services revenue also included gains from soc’s sales of originated contracts to cit the decision to finance through snapon or another financing entity is solely at the election of the customer when assessing customers for potential financing snapon considers various factors regarding ability to pay including customers’ financial condition collateral debtservicing ability past payment experience and credit bureau information

prior to july 16 2009 soc substantially sold all of its loan originations to cit on a limited recourse basis soc retained the right to service such loans for a contractual servicing fee at the time the loan originations were sold to cit soc recognized a servicing asset since the contractual servicing fee provided soc with more than adequate compensation for the level of services provided contractual servicing fees were 83 million in 2009 92 million in 2008 and 93 million in 2007 

snapon’s international finance subsidiaries own the loans originated through their financing programs loans retained by soc prior to july 16 2009 and loans originated by soc subsequent to july 16 2009 are also owned by snapon revenue from interest income on the onbook financing portfolio is recognized over the life of the contracts with interest computed on the average daily balances of the underlying contracts 

impairment of goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets are tested for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the assets might be impaired annual impairment tests are performed by the company in the second quarter of each year 

snapon evaluates the recoverability of goodwill by estimating the future discounted cash flows of the businesses to which the goodwill relates estimated cash flows and related goodwill are grouped at the reporting unit level the company has determined that its reporting units for testing goodwill impairment are its operating segments or components of an operating segment that constitute a business for which discrete financial information is available and for which segment management regularly reviews the operating results in conjunction with the evaluation completed in the second quarter of 2009 and in accordance with us gaap snapon combined two of its previous reporting units into one operating segment and one reporting unit as a result of recent management realignment and other operational changes management made this determination in a manner consistent with how the company’s operating segments are managed based on this analysis the company has identified 11 reporting units within its four reportable segments 

snapon evaluates the recoverability of goodwill by utilizing an income approach that estimates the fair value of the future discounted cash flows of the reporting units to which the goodwill relates the future projections which are based on both past performance and the projections and assumptions used in the company’s current and long range operating plans are subject to change as a result of changing economic and competitive conditions significant estimates used by management in the discounted cash flows methodology include estimates of future cash flows based on expected growth rates price increases capital expenditures working capital levels the benefits of recent acquisitions and expected synergies and weightedaverage cost of capital that reflects the specific risk profile of the reporting unit being tested the company’s methodologies for valuing goodwill are applied consistently on a yearoveryear basis the assumptions used in performing the second quarter 2009 impairment calculations were evaluated in light of current market and business conditions snapon continues to believe that the future discounted cash flow valuation model provides the most reasonable and meaningful fair value estimate based upon the reporting units’ projections of future operating results and cash flows and replicates how market participants would value the company’s reporting units in an orderly transaction 

in the event the fair value of a reporting unit is less than the carrying value including goodwill the company would then perform an additional assessment that would compare the implied fair value of goodwill with the carrying amount of goodwill the determination of implied fair value of goodwill would require management to compare the estimated fair value of the reporting unit to the estimated fair value of the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit if necessary the company may consult with valuation specialists to assist with the assessment of the estimated fair value of the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit if the implied fair value of the goodwill is less than the carrying value an impairment loss would be recorded 

snapon also evaluates the recoverability of its indefinitelived trademarks by utilizing an income approach that estimates the fair value of the future discounted cash flows of each of its trademarks the future projections which are based on both past performance and the projections and assumptions used in the company’s current and long range operating plans are subject to change as a result of changing economic and competitive conditions significant estimates used by management in the discounted cash flows methodology include estimates of future cash flows based on expected growth and royalty rates expected synergies and a weightedaverage cost of equity that reflects the specific risk profile of the trademark being tested the company’s methodologies for valuing trademarks are applied consistently on a yearoveryear basis the assumptions used in performing the second quarter 2009 impairment calculations were evaluated in light of current market and business conditions snapon continues to believe that the future discounted cash flow valuation model provides the most reasonable and meaningful fair value estimate based upon the trademarks’ projected future cash flows and replicates how market participants would value the company’s trademarks in an orderly transaction 

  

 

 

  

 

  

snapon did not recognize any impairment on its goodwill or other indefinitelived intangible assets in 2009 2008 or 2007 inherent in fair value determinations are significant judgments and estimates including material assumptions about future revenue profitability and cash flows the company’s operational plans and its interpretation of current economic indicators should the operations of the businesses with which goodwill or other indefinitelived intangible assets are associated incur significant declines in profitability and cash flow due to significant adverse changes in business climate adverse actions by regulators unanticipated competition loss of key customers andor changes in technology or markets some or all of the recorded goodwill or other indefinitelived intangible assets could be subject to impairment and could result in a material adverse effect on snapon’s financial position or results of operations 

snapon completed its annual impairment testing of goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets in the second quarter of 2009 the results of which did not result in any impairment although the company consistently uses the same methods in developing the assumptions and estimates underlying the fair value calculations such estimates are uncertain by nature and can vary from actual results in performing its annual impairment testing the company performed a sensitivity analysis on the material assumptions used in the discounted cash flow valuation models for each of its 11 reporting units based on the company’s second quarter 2009 impairment testing and assuming a hypothetical 10 decrease in the estimated fair values of each of its 11 reporting units the hypothetical fair value of each of the company’s 11 reporting units would have been greater than its carrying value see note 6 to the consolidated financial statements for further information about goodwill and other intangible assets 

impairment of longlived and amortized intangible assets snapon performs impairment evaluations of its longlived assets including property plant and equipment and intangible assets with finite lives whenever business conditions or events indicate that those assets may be impaired when the estimated future undiscounted cash flows to be generated by the assets are less than the carrying value of the longlived assets the assets are written down to fair market value and a charge is recorded to current operations 

significant and unanticipated changes in circumstances such as significant adverse changes in business climate adverse actions by regulators unanticipated competition loss of key customers andor changes in technology or markets could require a provision for impairment in a future period 

allowances for doubtful accounts snapon maintains allowances for doubtful accounts to absorb probable loan losses inherent in its portfolio of receivables determination of the allowances requires management to exercise significant judgment about the timing frequency and severity of credit losses that could materially affect the provision for credit losses and therefore net income snapon evaluates the collectibility of its receivables based on a combination of various financial and qualitative factors that may affect customers’ ability to pay these factors may include customers’ financial condition collateral debtservicing ability past payment experience and credit bureau information snapon does not believe that accounts receivable represent significant concentrations of credit risk because of its diversified portfolio of individual customers and geographical areas 

the allowances for doubtful accounts represent management’s best estimate of the losses expected from the company’s trade accounts contract and finance receivable portfolios based on ongoing assessments and evaluations of collectibility and historical loss experience the levels of the allowances are based on many quantitative and qualitative factors including historical loss experience by loan type portfolio duration delinquency trends economic conditions and credit risk quality management regularly performs detailed reviews of its portfolios to determine if an impairment has occurred and to assess the adequacy of the allowances based on historical and current trends as well as other factors affecting credit losses additions to the allowances for doubtful accounts are charged to current period earnings amounts determined to be uncollectible are charged directly against the allowances while amounts recovered on previously chargedoff accounts increase the allowances if the financial condition of the company’s customers were to deteriorate resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments additional reserves would be required 

excess and obsolete inventory snapon records allowances for excess and obsolete inventory based on historical and estimated future demand and market conditions allowances for raw materials are largely based on an analysis of raw material age and actual physical inspection of raw material for fitness for use as part of evaluating the adequacy of allowances for workinprogress and finished goods management reviews individual product stockkeeping units skus by product category and product life cycle cost adjustments for each product categoryproduct lifecycle state are generally established and maintained based on a combination of historical experience forecasted sales and promotions technological obsolescence inventory age and other actual known conditions and circumstances should actual product marketability and raw material fitness for use be affected by conditions that are different from management estimates further adjustments to inventory allowances may be required 

  

 

 

 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued 

 

 

 

  

pension benefits the pension benefit obligation and related pension expense are calculated in accordance with us gaap and are impacted by certain actuarial assumptions changes in these assumptions are primarily influenced by factors outside of snapon’s control and can have a significant effect on the amounts reported in the financial statements snapon believes that the two most critical assumptions are i the expected return on plan assets and ii the assumed discount rate 

pension expense increases as the expected rate of return on plan assets decreases lowering the expected rate of return assumption for snapon’s domestic pension plan assets by 50 basis points would have increased snapon’s 2009 domestic pension expense by approximately 34 million snapon uses a threeyear marketrelated value asset method of amortizing the difference between actual and expected returns on its us plan assets 

the objective of snapon’s discount rate assumption is to reflect the rate at which the pension benefits could be effectively settled in making this determination the company takes into account the timing and amount of benefits that would be available under the plans the methodology for selecting the discount rate as of 2009 year end was to match the plan’s cash flows to that of a theoretical bond portfolio yield curve that provides the equivalent yields on zerocoupon bonds with an aa rating or better for each maturity the selection of the 59 weightedaverage discount rate for snapon’s domestic pension plans represents the single rate that produces the same present value of cash flows as the estimated benefit plan payments lowering snapon’s domestic discount rate assumption by 50 basis points would have increased snapon’s 2009 domestic pension expense and projected benefit obligation by approximately 33 million and 453 million respectively at 2009 year end snapon’s domestic projected benefit obligation comprised approximately 82 of snapon’s worldwide projected benefit obligation the weightedaverage discount rate for snapon’s foreign pension plans of 56 represents the single rate that produces the same present value of cash flows as the estimated benefit plan payments lowering snapon’s foreign discount rate assumption by 50 basis points would have increased snapon’s 2009 foreign pension expense and projected benefit obligation by approximately 11 million and 160 million respectively 

actuarial gains and losses in excess of 10 percent of the greater of the projected benefit obligation or marketrelated value of assets are amortized on a straightline basis over the average remaining service period of active participants prior service costs resulting from plan amendments are amortized in equal annual amounts over the average remaining service period of affected active participants or over the remaining life expectancy of affected retired participants see note 11 to the consolidated financial statements for further information on pension plans 

postretirement benefits snapon’s postretirement benefits obligation and related expense are calculated in accordance with us gaap and are impacted by certain actuarial assumptions including health care trend rates an increase of one percentage point in health care costs would increase the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation by 21 million and the combined annual service and interest cost by 01 million a corresponding decrease of one percentage point would decrease the accumulated postretirement benefit by 19 million and the combined annual service and interest cost by 01 million see note 12 to the consolidated financial statements for further information on postretirement plans 

income taxes snapon records deferred income tax assets and liabilities for differences between the book basis and tax basis of the related net assets snapon records a valuation allowance when appropriate to reduce its deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized while the company has considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance if these estimates and assumptions change in the future the company may be required to adjust its valuation allowance this could result in a charge to or an increase in income in the period such determination is made 

in addition the company operates within multiple taxing jurisdictions and is subject to audit in these jurisdictions the company records accruals for the estimated outcomes of these audits and the accruals may change in the future due to new developments in each matter see note 8 to the consolidated financial statements for further information on income taxes 

outlook 

snapon believes that it will realize further benefits in 2010 from its rci sourcing and other cost reduction initiatives including approximately 25 million of yearoveryear savings from its 2009 restructuring activities snapon also anticipates continuing with its planned strategic investments including expansion in emerging growth markets snapon currently expects to incur approximately 18 million to 22 million of restructuring costs in 2010 primarily to improve the company’s cost structure in europe in 2010 snapon expects to incur 5 million per quarter of higher pension expense largely due to the amortization of prioryear investment losses related to the company’s us pension plan assets capital expenditures in 2010 are anticipated to be in a range of 55 million to 60 million for 2010 snapon anticipates that its effective income tax rate will approximate 335 

in 2010 snapon intends to continue aggressively managing the balance between investing and capturing growth opportunities with the need for cost reduction actions beyond those already implemented or planned the challenges of the current global economy make it difficult to presently predict this balance 

  

 

 

  

 

  




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

market credit and economic risks 

market risk is the potential economic loss that may result from adverse changes in the fair value of financial instruments snapon is exposed to market risk from changes in both foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates snapon monitors its exposure to these risks and attempts to manage the underlying economic exposures through the use of financial instruments such as forward exchange contracts interest rate swap agreements and treasury lock agreements snapon does not use derivative instruments for speculative or trading purposes snapon’s broadbased business activities help to reduce the impact that volatility in any particular area or related areas may have on its operating earnings as a whole snapon’s management takes an active role in the risk management process and has developed policies and procedures that require specific administrative and business functions to assist in the identification assessment and control of various risks 

foreign currency risk management 

snapon has significant international operations and is subject to certain risks inherent with foreign operations that include currency fluctuations and restrictions on movement of funds foreign exchange risk exists to the extent that snapon has payment obligations or receipts denominated in currencies other than the functional currency to manage these exposures snapon identifies naturally offsetting positions and then purchases hedging instruments to protect the residual net exposures see note 10 to the consolidated financial statements for information on foreign currency risk management 

interest rate risk management 

snapon’s interest rate risk management policies are designed to reduce the potential volatility of earnings that could arise from changes in interest rates through the use of interest rate swaps snapon aims to stabilize funding costs by managing the exposure created by the differing maturities and interest rate structures of snapon’s assets and liabilities see note 10 to the consolidated financial statements for information on interest rate risk management 

snapon utilizes a valueatrisk “var” model to determine the potential oneday loss in the fair value of its interest rate and foreign exchangesensitive financial instruments from adverse changes in market factors the var model estimates were made assuming normal market conditions and a 95 confidence level snapon’s computations are based on the interrelationships among movements in various currencies and interest rates variancecovariance technique these interrelationships were determined by observing interest rate and foreign currency market changes over the preceding quarter 

the estimated maximum potential oneday loss in fair value calculated using the var model at 2009 year end was 39 million on interest ratesensitive financial instruments and 04 million on foreign currencysensitive financial instruments the var model is a risk management tool and does not purport to represent actual losses in fair value that will be incurred by snapon nor does it consider the potential effect of favorable changes in market factors 

credit risk 

credit risk is the possibility of loss from a customer’s failure to make payments according to contract terms prior to granting credit each customer is evaluated taking into consideration the borrower’s financial condition collateral debtservicing capacity past payment experience credit bureau information and other financial and qualitative factors that may affect the borrower’s ability to repay specific credit reviews and standard industry credit scoring models are used in performing this evaluation loans that have been granted are typically monitored through an asset quality review process that closely monitors past due accounts and initiates collection actions when appropriate in addition to its direct credit risk exposure snapon also has credit risk exposure for certain socoriginated contracts with recourse provisions related to franchisee van loans sold by soc at 2009 year end 176 million of franchisee van loans contain a recourse provision to snapon if the loans become more than 90 days past due 

counterparty risk 

snapon is exposed to credit losses in the event of nonperformance by the counterparties to various financial agreements including its foreign exchange interest rate swap and treasury lock agreements snapon does not obtain collateral or other security to support financial instruments subject to credit risk but monitors the credit standing of the counterparties and enters into agreements only with financial institution counterparties with a credit rating of a or better snapon does not anticipate nonperformance by its counterparties but cannot provide assurances 

  

 

 

  

 

  

economic risk 

economic risk is the possibility of loss resulting from economic instability in certain areas of the world snapon continually monitors its exposure in these markets 

as a result of the above market credit and economic risks net income and revenues in any particular period may not be representative of fullyear results and may vary significantly from year to year inflation has not had a significant impact on the company 

commodity risk 

the company is a purchaser of certain commodities such as steel natural gas and electricity the company is also a purchaser of components and parts that are integrated into the company’s end products as well as the purchaser of certain finished goods all of which may contain various commodities including steel aluminum and others snapon’s supply of raw materials and purchased components are generally and readily available from numerous suppliers 

the principal raw material used in the manufacture of our products is steel which we purchase in competitive pricesensitive markets to meet snapon’s high quality standards our steel needs range from specialized alloys which are available only from a limited group of approved suppliers to commodity types of alloys these raw materials have historically exhibited price and demand cyclicality some of these materials have been and in the future may be in short supply as some steel alloys require specialized manufacturing procedures we could experience inventory shortages if we were required to use an alternative manufacturer on short notice additionally unexpected price increases could result in higher prices to our customers or an erosion of the margins on our products 

we believe our ability to sell our products is also dependent on the number of vehicles on the road the number of miles driven and the general aging of vehicles these factors affect the frequency type and amount of service and repair performed on vehicles by technicians and therefore affect the demand for the number of technicians the prosperity of the technicians and subsequently the demand the technicians have for our tools other products and services and the value they place on those products and services to the extent that gasoline prices increase consumers may turn to other nongasoline based methods of transportation including more frequent use of public transportation a decrease in the use of gasoline consuming vehicles may lead to fewer repairs and less demand for our products 

to the extent that commodity prices increase and the company does not have firm pricing agreements with its suppliers the company may experience margin declines to the extent that it is not able to increase the selling prices of its products

franchise fee revenue including nominal nonrefundable initial and ongoing monthly fees primarily for sales and business training and marketing and product promotion programs is recognized as the fees are earned 

  

sales and distribution 

  

snapon markets and distributes its products and related services principally to professional tool and equipment users around the world the two largest market sectors are the vehicle service and repair sector and the industrial sector 

  

vehicle service and repair sector 

  

the vehicle service and repair sector has three main customer groups i professional technicians who purchase tools and equipment for themselves ii vehicle service and repair shop owners and managers  including independent shops national chains and automotive dealerships  who purchase tools equipment and diagnostics products for use by multiple technicians within a service or repair facility and iii oems 

  

snapon provides innovative tool equipment and business solutions as well as technical sales support and training to meet technicians’ evolving needs snapon’s franchise van distribution system offers technicians the convenience of purchasing quality tools with minimal disruption of their work routine snapon also provides owners and managers of shops where technicians work with tools diagnostics equipment repair and service information including electronic parts catalogs and shop management products through its equipment solutions “oem facilitation” business snapon provides oems with products and services including tools consulting and facilitation services snapon’s facilitation services include product procurement distribution and administrative support to customers for their dealership equipment programs 

  

major challenges for snapon and the vehicle service and repair sector include the increasing rate of technological change within motor vehicles vehicle population growth vehicle life and the resulting impact on the businesses of both our suppliers and customers that is necessitated by such change snapon believes it is a meaningful participant in the market sector for vehicle service and repair 

  

industrial sector 

  

snapon markets its products globally to a broad crosssection of industrial and commercial customers including maintenance and repair operations manufacturing and assembly facilities various government agencies facilities and operations including military operations vocational and technical schools aerospace and aviation oem and repair customers oil and gas developers mining operations energy and power generation equipment fabricators agriculture infrastructure construction companies and other customers that require instrumentation service tools andor equipment for their products 

  

the industrial sector for snapon has achieved growth in recent years by providing valueadded products and services to an increasingly expanding global base of customers particularly those in the market segments of natural resources power generation aerospace government and education through its experienced and dispersed sales organization industrial “solutioneers” strive to develop unique and highly valued productivity solutions for customers worldwide that leverage snapon’s product service and development capabilities 

  

major challenges in the industrial sector include a highly competitive costconscious environment and a trend toward customers making many of their tool and equipment purchases through one integrated supplier snapon believes it is a meaningful participant in the market sector for industrial tools and equipment 

  

  

 

  

  

distribution channels 

  

snapon serves customers primarily through the following channels of distribution the mobile van channel company direct sales distributors and ecommerce the following discussion summarizes snapon’s general approach for each channel and is not intended to be allinclusive 

  

mobile van channel 

  

in the united states the majority of sales to the vehicle service and repair sector are conducted through snapon’s worldwide franchise van channel snapon’s franchisees primarily serve vehicle service technicians and vehicle service shop owners generally providing weekly contact at the customer’s place of business franchisees’ sales are concentrated in hand and power tools tool storage products small diagnostic and shop equipment and diagnostics and repair information products which can easily be transported in a van and demonstrated during a brief sales call franchisees purchase snapon’s products at a discount from suggested list prices and resell them at prices established by the franchisee us franchisees are provided a list of places of business that serves as the basis of the franchisee’s sales route 

  

snapon also offers an option termed the “gateway program” to potential us franchisees that do not meet the franchise qualification requirements gateway program participants have less upfront investment and are provided an initial base level of consigned inventory from snapon to assist them in gaining experience and building equity toward the future purchase of a standard franchise snapon also provides certain franchisees the opportunity to add vans to their franchise or to add a limited number of additional franchises snapon charges nominal initial and ongoing monthly franchise fees since 1991 new us franchisees and a majority of the pre1991 us franchisees have been enrolled as franchisees of snapon at 2008 year end 3231 us franchisees approximately 96 were enrolled as franchisees or employed by franchisees as compared with 3269 us franchisees approximately 96 at yearend 2007 

  

snapon has replicated its us franchise van distribution model in certain other countries including australia canada germany japan the netherlands south africa and the united kingdom in many of these markets as in the united states purchase decisions are generally made or influenced by professional vehicle service technicians and shop owners 

  

through soc financing is available to us franchisees including financing for van and truck leases working capital loans and loans to enable new franchisees to fund the purchase of the franchise internationally snapon offers financing to its franchisees and customer networks through its wholly owned finance subsidiaries while snapon offers financing to qualified franchisees and their customers through soc and its wholly owned international finance subsidiaries the decision to finance through snapon or another financing entity is solely at the election of the customer 

  

snapon supports its franchisees with a field organization of regional offices franchise performance teams diagnostic sales developers “dsds” customer care centers and distribution centers snapon also provides sales and business training and marketing and product promotion programs as well as customer and franchisee financing programs through soc and its wholly owned international finance subsidiaries all of which are designed to strengthen franchisee sales in the united states and canada the national franchise advisory council and the snapon tools canadian franchise advisory council both of which are composed of franchisees that are elected by franchisees assist snapon in identifying and implementing enhancements to the franchise program 

  

in the united states franchisees work closely with the dsds the dsd specialists demonstrate and sell higherpricepoint diagnostics and vehicle service shop management information systems dsds work independently and with franchisees to identify and generate sales leads among vehicle service shop owners and managers dsds are snapon employees who beginning in 2008 are compensated through a combination of base salary and commission a franchisee receives a brokerage fee from certain sales made by the dsds to the franchisee’s customers most products sold through franchisees and the dsds are sold under the snapon  bluepoint and sun brand names 

  

in late 2007 snapon started transitioning its former sales representative program in the united states into a new companyowned van program this program is designed to provide another pool of potential franchisees service customers in select new andor open routes not currently serviced by franchisees and allow snapon to pilot new sales and promotional ideas prior to introducing them to franchisees as of fiscal 2008 year end companyowned vans comprised less than 3 of the total us van population snapon may elect to increase the number of companyowned vans in the future 

  

  

 

  

  

company direct sales 

  

in the united states a significant proportion of shop equipment sales under the sun john bean and blackhawk brands and information products under the mitchell1 brand are made by a direct sales force that has responsibility for national and other accounts as the vehicle service and repair sector consolidates with more business conducted by national chains automotive dealerships and franchised service centers the company believes these larger organizations can be serviced most effectively by sales people who can demonstrate and sell the full line of equipment and diagnostic products and services snapon also sells these products and services directly to oems 

  

snapon brand tools and equipment are marketed to industrial and governmental customers in the united states through both industrial sales representatives who are employees and independent industrial distributors in most markets outside the united states industrial sales are conducted through independent distributors the sales representatives focus on industrial customers whose main purchase criteria are quality and service at the end of 2008 snapon had industrial sales representatives in the united states australia canada japan mexico puerto rico and some european asian latin american and middle eastern countries with the united states representing the majority of snapon’s total industrial sales 

  

business solutions sells automotive power equipment and power sports software solutions both domestically and internationally through an internal sales force products and services are marketed to two targeted groups oems and individual dealerships to effectively reach the large oems in the automotive segment such as general motors corporation daimler ag ford motor company chrysler llc and toyota motor corporation business solutions has deployed a team of business development professionals in the world’s principal automotive centers in the united states the united kingdom germany italy france spain and japan in the united states and canada automotive products and services are sold directly to individual dealerships using an experienced sales force in reaching customers such as john deere deere  company jc bamford excavators ltd jcb and yamaha corporation of america yamaha in the power equipment and power sports segments teams are also positioned to support the 90 brands that business solutions distributes to globally business management solutions are sold directly to the automotive oems in the united states and throughout europe including the united kingdom 

  

distributors 

  

sales of certain tools and equipment are made through independent vehicle service and industrial distributors who purchase the items from snapon and resell them to end users hand tools under the bahco and fish and hook brands and trade names for example are sold through distributors in europe north and south america asia and certain other parts of the world wheel service and other vehicle service equipment are sold through distributors primarily under brands including hofmann john bean cartec and blackhawk  sun branded equipment is marketed through distributors in south america and asia  and through both a direct sales force and distributors in europe 

  

ecommerce 

  

snapon’s ecommerce development initiatives allow snapon to combine the capabilities of the internet with snapon’s existing brand sales and distribution strengths to reach new and underserved customer segments snapon offers current and prospective customers online aroundtheclock access to purchase products through its public internet web site at wwwsnaponcom  the site features an online catalog containing nearly 14000 products including snapon hand tools power tools tool storage units and diagnostic equipment available to consumers and professionals in the united states the united kingdom canada and australia   at the end of 2008 snapon had more than 500000 registered users including approximately 39000 industrial accounts ecommerce and certain other system enhancement initiatives are designed to improve productivity and further leverage the oneonone relationships and service snapon has with its current and prospective customers through businesstobusiness and businesstoconsumer capabilities snapon and its franchisees are enhancing communications with customers on a realtime 24hour 7day a week basis 

  

competition 

  

snapon competes on the basis of its product quality and performance product line breadth and depth service brand awareness and imagery and technological innovation while no single company competes with snapon across all of its product lines and distribution channels various companies compete in one or more product categories andor distribution channels 

  

  

 

  

  

snapon believes it is a leading manufacturer and distributor of professional tools diagnostics equipment repair software and solutions offering the broadest line of these products to the vehicle service industry the major competitors selling to professional technicians in the automotive service and repair sector through the mobile van channel include mac tools the stanley works matco danaher corporation and cornwell snapon also competes with companies that sell tools and equipment to automotive technicians through nonmobile van distributors including craftsman sears brands llc ridgid and husky the home depot inc and kobalt lowes companies inc auto parts supply outlets such as napa autozone inc and pep boys and tool supply warehousesdistributorships such as medco and integrated supply network inc isn within the power tools category snapon’s major competitors include ingersollrand co limited the black  decker corporation makita corporation chicago pneumatic atlas copco and milwaukee electric techtronic industries co ltd in the industrial sector major competitors include facom tools and proto the stanley works armstrong danaher corporation irwin newell rubbermaid inc cooper industries ltd and westward ww grainger inc the major competitors selling diagnostics and shop equipment and information to automotive dealerships independent repair shop owners and managers in the vehicle service and repair sector include corghi spa fluke and hennessy danaher corporation robinair and otc spx corporation hunter engineering rotary lift and chief automotive dover corporation caroliner ab lexcom gmbh infomedia ltd enigma alldata autozone inc and the proprietary electronic parts catalog diagnostic and information systems of oems 

  

raw materials and purchased product 

  

snapon’s supply of raw materials and purchased components are generally and readily available from numerous suppliers during 2007 and 2008 snapon experienced higher pricing related to certain grades and alloys of steel snapon believes it has secured an ample supply of both bar and coil steel for the near future to ensure stable supply to meet material demands the company does not anticipate experiencing any significant steel pricing or availability issues in 2009 

  

patents trademarks and other intellectual property 

  

snapon vigorously pursues and relies on patent protection to protect its intellectual property and its position in its markets as of january 3 2009 snapon and its subsidiaries held over 860 active and pending patents in the united states and over 1660 active and pending patents outside of the united states sales relating to any single patent did not represent a material portion of snapon’s revenues in the last three years 

  

examples of products that have features or designs that benefit from patent protection include wheel alignment systems wheel balancers tire changers lifts test lanes sealed ratchets electronic torque instruments ratcheting screwdrivers emissionssensing devices and diagnostic equipment 

  

much of the technology used in the manufacture of vehicle service tools and equipment is in the public domain snapon relies primarily on trade secret protection to protect proprietary processes used in manufacturing methods and processes are patented when appropriate copyright protection is also utilized when appropriate 

  

trademarks used by snapon are of continuing importance to snapon in the marketplace trademarks have been registered in the united states and more than 100 other countries and additional applications for trademark registrations are pending snapon vigorously polices proper use of its trademarks snapon’s right to manufacture and sell certain products is dependent upon licenses from others however these products under license do not represent a material portion of snapon’s net sales 

  

domain names have become a valuable corporate asset for companies around the world including snapon domain names often contain a trademark or service mark or even a corporate name and are often considered intellectual property the recognition and value of the snapon name trademark and domain name are core strengths of the company 

  

  

 

  

  

  

snapon is selectively and strategically licensing the snapon brand to carefully selected manufacturing and distribution companies for items such as apparel work boots lighting and a variety of other goods in order to further build equity and market presence for the company’s strongest brand 

  

environment 

  

snapon is subject to various environmental laws ordinances regulations and other requirements of government authorities in the united states and other nations at snapon these environmental liabilities are managed through the snapon environmental hygiene and safety management system “eh  sms” which is applied worldwide the system is based upon continual improvement and is certified to iso 140012004 and ohsas 180011999 verified through det norske veritas dnv certification inc 

  

snapon believes that it complies with applicable environmental control requirements in its operations expenditures on environmental matters through eh  sms have not had and snapon does not for the foreseeable future expect them to have a material effect upon snapon’s capital expenditures earnings or competitive position 

  

employees 

  

at the end of january 2009 snapon employed approximately 11500 people compared to approximately 11600 people at the end of january 2008 the yearoveryear decrease reflects the impacts of restructuringrelated and management realignment actions at various snapon facilities partially offset by the addition of approximately 600 employees from the company’s march 5 2008 acquisition of wanda snapon a tool manufacturer in china 

  

approximately 3000 employees or 26 of snapon’s worldwide workforce are represented by unions andor covered under collective bargaining agreements approximately 1400 employees are covered under agreements expiring in 2009 in recent years snapon has not experienced any significant work slowdowns stoppages or other labor disruptions 

  

the number of covered union employees whose contracts expire within the next five years approximates 1400 employees in 2009 900 employees in 2010 400 employees in 2011 and zero employees in 2012 and 2013 

  

there can be no assurance that future contracts with snapon’s unions will be renegotiated upon terms acceptable to snapon 

  

working capital 

  

as most of snapon’s business is not seasonal and its inventory needs are relatively constant no unusual working capital needs arose during the year snapon did not have a significant backlog of orders at january 3 2009 

  

snapon’s liquidity and capital resources and use of working capital are discussed herein in “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” 

  

neither snapon nor any of its segments except financial services depend on any single customer small group of customers or government for any material part of its revenues as a result of soc’s relationship with cit snapon’s financial services segment depends on cit for more than 10 of its revenues 

  




 item 1a  risk factors   in evaluating the company careful consideration should be given to the following risk factors in addition to the other information included in this annual report on form 10k including the consolidated financial statements and the related notes each of these risk factors could adversely affect the company’s business operating results cash flows andor financial condition as well as adversely affect the value of an investment in the company’s common stock 

  

  

 

  

  

economic conditions and world events could affect our operating results 

  

we our franchisees and our customers may be adversely affected by an economic downturn such as changes in consumer and investor confidence instability in the credit and financial markets volatile corporate profits and reduced business and consumer spending we our franchisees and customers and the economy as a whole also may be affected by future world events such as acts of terrorism developments in the war on terrorism conflicts in international situations and by natural disasters these factors may affect our results of operations by reducing our sales margins andor net income as a result of a slowdown in customer orders or order cancellations in addition political and social turmoil related to international conflicts and terrorist acts may put further pressure on economic conditions abroad unstable political social and economic conditions may make it difficult for our franchisees customers suppliers and us to accurately forecast and plan future business activities if such conditions persist our business financial condition results of operations and cash flow could be negatively affected 

  

the success of snapon’s mobile van tool distribution business depends on the success of its franchisees 

  

approximately 38 of our 2008 revenues were generated by the snapon tools group which consists of snapon’s business operations serving the worldwide van channel except in limited circumstances each of our mobile tool vans is operated by a franchisee pursuant to a franchise agreement snapon’s success is dependent on its relationships with franchisees individually and collectively as they are the primary sales and service link between the company and vehicle service and repair technicians who are an important class of end users for snapon’s products and services if our franchisees are not successful or if we do not maintain an effective relationship with our franchisees the delivery of products the collection of receivables andor our relationship with end users could be adversely affected and thereby negatively impact our business financial condition results of operations and cash flow 

  

in addition if we are unable to maintain effective relationships with franchisees the company or the franchisees may choose to terminate the relationship which may result in i open routes in which enduse customers are not provided reliable service ii litigation resulting from termination iii reduced collections or increased writeoffs of franchisee receivables owed to snapon andor iv reduced collections or increased writeoffs of extended credit contracts and to a lesser extent lease contracts that are collected by franchisees on behalf of soc as snapon has approximately 4700 franchisees worldwide and most of these franchise relationships are governed by contract it is not uncommon for litigation to result from the termination of these relationships 

  

the automotive industry is currently experiencing financial difficulties which could affect our business and operating results 

  

some of our business units have substantial interrelationships with the automotive industry there is currently substantial weakness and turmoil in the united states’ automotive industry this weakness could result in the failure of certain automobile manufacturers as well as suppliers and dealers who are dependent upon them it could also result in a reduction in the number of automobile dealerships through consolidations or as a result of changes in the automakers or their manner of conducting business additionally the weakness of companies in that industry could affect their levels of purchases from us and the collectibility of amounts owed to us even though we believe that our products and services enhance productivity a reduction in the number of automotive manufacturers or dealers or their capital expenditures could substantially affect our sales any of those factors could negatively affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flow 

  

raw material and energy price fluctuations and shortages including steel and various fuel sources could adversely affect the ability to obtain needed manufacturing materials and could adversely affect our results of operations 

  

the principal raw material used in the manufacture of our products is steel which we purchase in competitive pricesensitive markets to meet snapon’s high quality standards our steel needs range from specialized alloys which are available only from a limited group of approved suppliers to commodity types of alloys these raw materials have historically exhibited price and demand fluctuations of a cyclical nature some of these materials have been and in the future may be in short supply as some steel alloys require specialized manufacturing procedures we could experience inventory shortages if we were required to use an alternative manufacturer on short notice additionally unexpected price increases for other raw materials could result in higher prices to our customers or an erosion of the margins on our products 

  

  

 

  

  

we believe our ability to sell our products is also dependent on the number of vehicles on the road the number of miles driven and the general aging of vehicles these factors affect the frequency type and amount of service and repair performed on vehicles by technicians and therefore affect the demand for the number of technicians the prosperity of the technicians and subsequently the demand technicians have for our tools other products and services and the value technicians place on those products and services to the extent that gasoline prices increase consumers may turn to other nongasoline based methods of transportation including more frequent use of public transportation a decrease in the use of gasoline consuming vehicles may lead to fewer repairs and less demand for our products 

  

we use various energy sources to transport produce and distribute products and some of our products have components that are petroleum based petroleum and energy prices have recently been volatile and have generally increased further volatility and changes may be caused by market fluctuations supply and demand currency fluctuation production and transportation disruption world events and changes in governmental programs energy price increases raise both our operating costs and the costs of our materials and we may not be able to increase our prices enough to offset these costs higher prices also may reduce the level of future customer orders and our profitability 

  

instability and uncertainty in the credit and financial markets could adversely impact the availability of credit 

  

instability and uncertainty in the credit and financial markets could adversely impact the availability of future financing and the terms on which it might be available to snapon its enduser customers franchisees and suppliers inability to access credit markets or a deterioration in the terms on which financing might be available could have an adverse impact on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flow 

  

the inability to provide acceptable financing alternatives to enduser customers and franchisees could adversely impact operating results 

  

an integral component of our business and profitability is our ability to offer financing alternatives to enduser customers and franchisees which for our domestic financing operations are managed through a joint venture with cit since 1999 cit has been the exclusive purchaser of the credit and installment financing arranged by soc in the united states a deterioration of the relationship between the joint venture partners including if the joint venture should be unexpectedly dissolved or if cit were to no longer purchase the credit and installment financing contracts originated by soc could have an adverse impact on our results of operations and ability to provide financing to enduser customers and franchisees in the united states adverse fluctuations in interest rates andor the ability to provide competitive financing programs could also have an adverse impact on our revenue and profitability 

  

exposure to credit risks of customers and resellers may make it difficult to collect receivables and could adversely affect operating results and financial condition 

  

industry and economic conditions have the potential to weaken the financial position of some of our customers if circumstances surrounding our customers’ financial capabilities were to deteriorate such writedowns or writeoffs would negatively affect our operating results for the period in which they occur and if large could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flow 

  

failure to achieve expected investment returns on pension plan assets as well as changes in interest rates could adversely impact our results of operations financial position and cash flow 

  

snapon sponsors various pension benefit plans the assets of the pension plans are broadly diversified in an attempt to mitigate the risk of a large loss the assets are invested in equity securities fixed income securities real estate and other real assets other alternative investments and cash required funding for the company’s defined benefit pension plans is determined in accordance with guidelines set forth in the federal employee retirement income security act erisa additional contributions to enhance the funded status of the pension plans can be made at the company’s discretion however there can be no assurance that the value of the pension plan assets or the investment returns on those plan assets will be sufficient to meet the future benefit obligations of such plans in addition during periods of adverse investment market conditions and declining interest rates the company may be required to make additional cash contributions to the plans that could reduce our financial flexibility 

  

  

 

  

  

our defined benefit pension plan obligations are affected by changes in market interest rates significant fluctuations in market interest rates have added and may further add volatility to our pension plan obligations declining market interest rates will increase our pension plan obligations while our plan assets are broadly diversified there are inherent market risks associated with investments our defined benefit pension plan assets in the aggregate incurred a substantial loss in fiscal 2008 as a result of market conditions if adverse market conditions continue our plan assets could incur further losses since we may need to make additional contributions to address an increase in obligations andor a loss in plan assets the combination of declining market interest rates andor plan asset investment losses could adversely impact our financial position and results of operations 

  

the company’s defined benefit pension expense is comprised of the following factors i service cost ii interest on projected benefit obligations iii the expected return on plan assets iv the amortization of prior service costs and v the effects of actuarial gains and losses the accounting for pensions involves the estimation of a number of factors that are highly uncertain certain factors such as the interest cost and the expected return on plan assets are impacted by changes in market interest rates and the value of plan assets a significant decrease in market interest rates and a decrease in the fair value of plan assets would increase net pension expense and may adversely affect the company’s future results of operations see note 11 to the consolidated financial statements for further information on the company’s pension benefit plans 

  

the steps taken to restructure operations rationalize operating footprint lower operating expenses and achieve greater efficiencies in the supply chain could disrupt business 

  

we have taken steps in the past and expect to take additional steps in 2009 intended to improve customer service and to drive further efficiencies and reduce costs some of which could be disruptive to our business these actions collectively across our operating groups are focused on the following 

  

   

we believe that by executing on these focus areas along with a continued commitment to new innovative products and rci initiatives to drive higher levels of productivity and lower costs the company and its franchisees will realize stronger growth and profitability however failure to succeed in the implementation of any or all of these actions could result in an inability to achieve our financial goals and could be disruptive to the business 

  

in addition reductions to headcount and other cost reduction measures may result in the loss of technical expertise that could adversely affect our research and development efforts and ability to meet product development schedules efforts to reduce components of expense could result in the recording of charges for inventory and technologyrelated writeoffs workforce reduction costs or other charges relating to the consolidation of facilities if we were to incur a substantial charge to further these efforts our earnings or loss per share would be adversely affected in such period if we are unable to effectively manage our cost reduction and restructuring efforts our business financial condition results of operations and cash flow could be negatively affected 

  

failure to maintain effective distribution of products and services could adversely impact revenue gross margin and profitability 

  

we use a variety of distribution methods to sell our products and services successfully managing the interaction of our distribution efforts to reach various potential customer segments for our products and services is a complex process moreover since each distribution method has distinct risks costs and gross margins our failure to implement the most advantageous balance in the delivery model for our products and services could adversely affect our revenue and gross margins and therefore our profitability 

  

  

 

  

  

risks associated with the disruption of manufacturing operations could adversely affect profitability or competitive position 

  

we manufacture a significant portion of the products we sell any prolonged disruption in the operations of our existing manufacturing facilities whether due to technical or labor difficulties lack of raw material or component availability destruction of or damage to any facility including natural disasters use and storage of hazardous materials or other events or other reasons could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flow 

  

the inability to continue to introduce new products that respond to customer needs and achieve market acceptance could result in lower revenues and reduced profitability 

  

sales from new products represent a significant portion of our net sales and are expected to continue to represent a significant component of our future net sales we may not be able to compete effectively unless we continue to enhance existing products or introduce new products to the marketplace in a timely manner product improvements and new product introductions require significant financial and other resources including significant planning design development and testing at the technological product and manufacturing process levels our competitors’ new products may beat our products to market be more effective with more features be less expensive than our products andor render our products obsolete any new products that we develop may not receive market acceptance or otherwise generate any meaningful net sales or profits for us relative to our expectations based on among other things existing and anticipated investments in manufacturing capacity and commitments to fund advertising marketing promotional programs and research and development 

  

the global tool equipment and diagnostics and repair industry is competitive 

  

we face strong competition in all of our market segments price competition in our various industries is intense and pricing pressures from competitors and customers are increasing in general as a manufacturer and marketer of premium products and services the expectations of snapon’s customers and its franchisees are high and increasing any inability to maintain customer satisfaction could diminish snapon’s premium image and reputation and could result in a lessening of its ability to command premium pricing we expect that the level of competition will remain high in the future which could limit our ability to maintain or increase market share or profitability 

  

product liability claims and litigation could affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flow 

  

the products that we design andor manufacture can lead to product liability claims being filed against us to the extent that plaintiffs are successful in showing that defects in the design or manufacture of our products led to personal injury or property damage we may be subject to claims for damages although we are insured for damages above a certain amount we bear the costs and expenses associated with defending claims including frivolous lawsuits and are responsible for damages below the insurance retention amount as a manufacturer we can be subject to the costs and potential negative publicity of product recalls which could impact our results 

  

we may not successfully integrate businesses we acquire which could have an adverse impact on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flow 

  

the pursuit of future growth through acquisitions including participation in joint ventures involves significant risks that could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial position these risks include 

  

·   loss of the acquired businesses’ customers 

·   an inability to integrate successfully the acquired businesses’ operations 

·   inability to coordinate management and integrate and retain employees of the acquired businesses 

·   difficulties in implementing and maintaining consistent standards controls procedures policies and information systems 

·   failure to realize anticipated synergies economies of scale or other anticipated benefits or to maintain operating margins 

·   strain on our personnel systems and resources and diversion of attention from other priorities 

·   incurrence of additional debt and related interest expense 

·   the dilutive effect of the issuance of additional equity securities 

·   unforeseen or contingent liabilities of the acquired businesses and 

·   large writeoffs or writedowns or the impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets 

  

  

 

  

  

information technology infrastructure is critical to supporting business objectives failure of our information technology infrastructure to operate effectively could adversely affect our business 

  

we depend heavily on information technology infrastructure to achieve our business objectives if a problem occurs that impairs this infrastructure the resulting disruption could impede our ability to record or process orders manufacture and ship in a timely manner or otherwise carry on business in the normal course any such events could cause us to lose customers or revenue and could require us to incur significant expense to remediate 

  

in association with initiatives to better integrate business units rationalize operating footprint and improve responsiveness to franchisees and customers snapon is replacing and enhancing its existing global enterprise resource planning erp management information systems the integration implementation and deployment of new information technology processes and a common information infrastructure which began in 2006 is occurring over a multiyear period we could experience disruptions in our business as we implement the system enhancements which could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flow 

  

the recognition of impairment charges on goodwill or other intangible assets would adversely impact future financial position and results of operations 

  

we are required to perform impairment tests on our goodwill and other intangibles annually or at any time when events occur which could impact the value of our business segments our determination of whether impairment has occurred is based on a comparison of each of our reporting units’ fair market value with its carrying value significant and unanticipated changes in circumstances such as significant adverse changes in business climate adverse actions by regulators unanticipated competition loss of key customers andor changes in technology or markets could require a provision for impairment in a future period that could substantially affect our reported earnings and reduce our consolidated net worth and shareholders’ equity 

  

failure to adequately protect intellectual property could adversely affect our business 

  

intellectual property rights are an important and integral component of our business we attempt to protect our intellectual property rights through a combination of patent trademark copyright and trade secret laws as well as licensing agreements and thirdparty nondisclosure and assignment agreements adverse determinations in a judicial or administrative proceeding could prevent us from manufacturing and selling our products or prevent us from stopping others from manufacturing and selling competing products failure to obtain or maintain adequate protection of our intellectual property rights for any reason could have a material adverse effect on our business 

  

our operations expose us to the risk of environmental liabilities costs litigation and violations that could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and reputation 

  

certain of our operations are subject to environmental laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which they operate which impose limitations on the discharge of pollutants into the ground air and water and establish standards for the generation treatment use storage and disposal of hazardous wastes we must also comply with various health and safety regulations in the united states and abroad in connection with our operations failure to comply with any of these laws could result in civil and criminal monetary and nonmonetary penalties and damage to our reputation in addition we may incur costs related to remedial efforts or alleged environmental damage associated with past or current waste disposal practices we cannot provide assurance that our costs of complying with current or future environmental protection and health and safety laws will not exceed our estimates 

  

  

 

  

  

foreign operations are subject to currency exchange political economic and other risks that could adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flow 

  

approximately 43 of our revenues in 2008 were generated outside of the united states future growth rates and success of our business depends in large part on continued growth in our nonus operations including growth in emerging markets numerous risks and uncertainties affect our nonus operations these risks and uncertainties include political economic and social instability such as acts of war civil disturbance or acts of terrorism local labor conditions changes in government policies and regulations including imposition or increases in withholding and other taxes on remittances and other payments by international subsidiaries transportation delays or interruptions and difficulties in enforcement of contract and intellectual property rights we are also affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates inflation rates and interest rates additionally cash generated in nonus jurisdictions may be difficult to repatriate to the united states in a taxefficient manner our foreign operations are also subject to other risks and challenges such as the need to staff and manage diverse workforces respond to the needs of multiple national and international marketplaces and differing business climates and cultures in various countries 

  

the inability to successfully defend claims from taxing authorities could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flow 

  

we conduct business in many countries which requires us to interpret the income tax laws and rulings in each of those taxing jurisdictions due to the subjectivity of tax laws between those jurisdictions as well as the subjectivity of factual interpretations our estimates of income tax liabilities may differ from actual payments or assessments claims from taxing authorities related to these differences could have an adverse impact on our operating results and financial position 

  

failure to attract and retain qualified personnel could lead to a loss of revenue andor profitability 

  

snapon’s success depends in part on the efforts and abilities of its senior management team and other key employees their skills experience and industry contacts significantly benefit our operations and administration the failure to attract and retain members of our senior management team and other key employees could have a negative effect on our operating results in addition transitions of important responsibilities to new individuals inherently include the possibility of disruptions to our business and operations which could negatively affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flow

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

  

management overview 

  

in 2008 the world experienced a global economic slowdown and tightened credit environment despite the challenges of a deepening global recession many of snapon’s businesses experienced sales growth in 2008 and we continued investing in our strategic growth initiatives aimed at fortifying our business models pursuing geographic and customer diversification expanding our presence in emerging markets and driving value creation processes including innovation and rapid continuous improvement we believe the continued advancement of these strategic initiatives will help create an environment to achieve longterm value for company shareholders associates franchisees and other distributor partners across our varied business segments and channels 

  

net sales in 2008 of 28533 million increased slightly from 28412 million in 2007 while operating earnings of 3888 million in 2008 increased 197 from 3248 million in 2007 the significant increase in yearoveryear operating earnings was primarily driven by contributions from our ongoing efficiency productivity and cost reduction collectively “rapid continuous improvement” or “rci” initiatives as well as increased income from our financial services businesses these benefits were partially offset by higher costs in 2008 as a result of price increases for steel fuel and other commodities 

  

economic challenges however increased significantly during the fourth quarter of 2008 as customers curtailed spending in response to the worsening global recession as a result of the economic slowdown snapon’s sales in the fourth quarter of 2008 declined 101 from prior year levels in response to these economic challenges we accelerated certain rci initiatives and are continuing – even accelerating – certain planned investments that include further expansion of our manufacturing capacity in china and in eastern europe as we see these investments as potentially enabling nearterm growth in 2009 we intend to aggressively manage the balance between investing and capturing growth opportunities with the need for additional cost reduction actions beyond those already implemented we also experienced considerable adverse effects from foreign currency exchange rate movements in the fourth quarter of 2008 given our increasingly global footprint foreign currency exchange rates could have a more pronounced effect on our sales and operating profit comparisons in 2009 

  

our strategic priorities and plans for 2009 will continue to build on the improvement initiatives underway to achieve sustainable profitable growth global market conditions however may affect the level and timing of resources deployed in pursuit of these initiatives in 2009 

  

in the commercial  industrial group  higher sales including growth in emerging markets combined with expense control and savings from restructuring initiatives delivered improvements in operating performance segment net sales of 14093 million in 2008 were up 43 over 2007 levels and operating earnings of 1673 million in 2008 were up 272 over 2007 levels benefits from continued sales growth and improved levels of customer service along with savings from ongoing rci and restructuring initiatives including increased production and sourcing of materials from lowercost regions were major contributors to the yearoveryear earnings improvement 

  

the commercial  industrial group expects to continue to build on the following strategic priorities in 2009 

  

·   continue to invest in emerging market growth initiatives including china india and eastern europe 

·   increase market share in key industrial market segments by reaching new customers expanding our business with existing customers and continually expanding valueadded content 

·   continue to invest in innovation that delivers productivityenhancing solutions that utilize the latest technology 

·   continue to pursue key customer segments that offer longterm growth potential and 

·   continue to rationalize the operating footprint and reduce structural costs 

  

in the snapon tools group  progress continued on fundamental strategic initiatives to strengthen the group and enhance franchisee profitability and satisfaction 

  

segment net sales of 11040 million in 2008 were down slightly from 2007 levels primarily due to a more challenging economic environment for sales of higherpriced products and hand tools supply chain improvements and an ongoing transition to a marketdemandbased replenishment system in 2008 continued to improve complete and ontime delivery of a broad assortment of products operating earnings of 1177 million in 2008 declined from 1251 million in 2007 primarily due to increased commodity and inflation costs higher restructuring costs and increased “lastin firstout” “lifo” related inventory valuation expense 

  

  

 

  

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued 

  

the snapon tools group expects to continue to build on the progress made in enhancing the franchise proposition and delivering customer productivity solutions with specific initiatives in 2009 focused on the following 

  

·   continue to improve franchisee profitability and satisfaction 

·   continue to fill open territories in the united states 

·   develop new programs to expand market coverage 

·   continue to invest in new product innovation and development and 

·   increase supply chain flexibility through investments in manufacturing and rci initiatives 

  

by executing in these areas we believe that we as well as our franchisees will continue to serve more customers better and more profitably 

  

in the diagnostics  information group  segment net sales of 6278 million in 2008 declined 35 from 2007 levels while operating earnings in 2008 increased 135 over 2007 levels to 1129 million this significant increase in operating earnings reflects increased sales of certain product lines contributions from increased productivity and lower costs as a result of rci initiatives across all businesses and 54 million from the adjustment of a preacquisition contingency acquired with the snapon business solutions “business solutions” acquisition in november 2006 

  

sales of diagnostics products worldwide and mitchell1™ information products continued to grow as a result of the development and launch of new products and the continued expansion of functionality and product integration these sales increases were more than offset by lower original equipment manufacturer “oem” program sales and lower sales at business solutions oem sales in 2008 declined from 2007 levels primarily as a result of the rollout of a major essential tool program in north america in 2007 that was not repeated in 2008 and the impact of the wind down of a facilitation program in europe despite a yearoveryear sales decline including the impact from the planned exit of certain noncore product lines the 2006 acquisition of business solutions continues to provide a strong base for relationships with key oem customers strengthening our position as a provider of essential productivity solutions 

  

the diagnostics  information group expects to focus on the following strategic priorities in 2009 

  

·   continue hardware and software content upgrades 

·   expand product range with new products and services 

·   increase penetration of geographic markets 

·   leverage integration of software solutions and 

·   continue productivity advancements through rci initiatives and leveraging of resources 

  

financial services revenue increased 292 to 814 million in 2008 and operating income of 373 million was up 665 from prior year primarily due to lower market discount rates in 2008 originations in 2008 were essentially flat with prioryear levels 

  

cash flows 

  

cash flow from operations was 2150 million in 2008 as compared to 2311 million in 2007 snapon used available cash in 2008 to invest 739 million in capital expenditures repurchase 1230000 shares of snapon common stock for 698 million and pay dividends totaling 697 million capital expenditures in 2008 of 739 million reflect higher levels of spending to support strategic supply chain and other growth initiatives including the expansion of the company’s manufacturing capabilities in lowercost regions and emerging markets as well as higher levels of efficiency and costreduction capital investments cash at yearend 2008 of 1158 million was up from 930 million at yearend 2007 in 2007 the company used available cash to repurchase 1860000 shares of snapon common stock for 944 million pay dividends totaling 648 million invest 619 million in capital expenditures and pay down debt of 366 million

liquidity and capital resources 

  

snapon’s growth has historically been funded by a combination of cash provided by operating activities and debt financing snapon believes that its cash from operations coupled with its sources of borrowings are sufficient to fund its anticipated requirements for working capital capital expenditures restructuring activities acquisitions common stock repurchases and dividend payments due to snapon’s credit rating over the years external funds have been available at a reasonable cost as of the close of business on february 13 2009 snapon’s longterm debt and commercial paper was rated a3 and p2 by moody’s investors service and a and a2 by standard  poor’s as of the date of this form 10k the credit and financial markets are in a period of substantial instability and uncertainty that is affecting the availability of credit to borrowers snapon believes that its current credit arrangements are sound and that the strength of its balance sheet affords the company the financial flexibility to respond to both internal growth opportunities and those available through acquisitions in light of the current state of the credit and financial markets however the company cannot provide any assurances of the availability of future financing or the terms on which it might be available

although the credit and financial markets are currently in a state of substantial instability and uncertainty snapon believes that it has sufficient available committed and uncommitted lines of credit and liquidity facilities to cover its expected funding needs on both a shortterm and longterm basis snapon manages its aggregate shortterm borrowings so as not to exceed its availability under its revolving credit facilities and committed lines of credit while the instability of the credit and financial markets has affected the market for commercial paper issuances and other shortterm debt snapon currently believes that it could access those markets for shortterm liquidity if the need were to arise snapon regularly monitors the credit and financial markets and may take advantage of what it believes are favorable market conditions to issue longterm debt to further improve its liquidity and capital resources nearterm liquidity requirements for snapon include the funding of its investments in capital expenditures and restructuring activities payments of dividends and interest and funding for share repurchases if any snapon also expects to make contributions of 82 million to its foreign pension plans and 13 million to its domestic pension plans in 2009 depending on market and other conditions snapon may elect to make discretionary cash contributions to its domestic pension plans in 2009

capital expenditures were 739 million in 2008 619 million in 2007 and 505 million in 2006 the increase in 2008 capital expenditures over 2007 levels included continued higher spending to accelerate the expansion of the company’s manufacturing capabilities in lowercost regions and emerging markets as well as increased spending to construct a new headquarters and development facility for snapon business solutions the company’s automotive parts and service information business which is expected to be completed in the fourth quarter of 2009 capital expenditures in all three years include higher levels of spending to support the company’s strategic supply chain and other growth initiatives including the installation of new production equipment and machine tooling to enhance manufacturing and distribution operations as well as provide ongoing replacements of manufacturing and distribution equipment capital spending over the last three years also included spending for the replacement and enhancement of the company’s existing global enterprise resource planning erp management information systems which will continue over a period of several years snapon believes that its cash generated from operations as well as the funds available from its credit facilities will be sufficient to fund the company’s capital expenditure requirements in 2009 

  

amortization expense was 241 million in 2008 222 million in 2007 and 34 million in 2006 the increase in amortization expense over 2006 levels is primarily due to the amortization of intangibles from the november 2006 acquisition of business solutions see note 6 to the consolidated financial statements for information on acquired intangible assets

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued 

  

  

consolidated joint venture 

  

soc a consolidated 50owned joint venture between snapon and cit provides a broad range of financial services to snapon’s us franchisee and customer network and to snapon’s industrial and other customers snapon and cit have identical voting and participation rights and responsibilities in soc see note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for further information on soc

new accounting standards 

  

see note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for information on new accounting standards 

  

critical accounting policies and estimates 

  

the consolidated financial statements and related notes contain information that is pertinent to management’s discussion and analysis the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period these estimates are generally based on historical experience current conditions and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily available from other sources as well as identifying and assessing our accounting treatment with respect to commitments and contingencies actual results could differ from those estimates 

  

the company’s significant accounting policies are described in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements 

  

snapon considers the following policies and estimates to be the most critical in understanding the judgments that are involved in the preparation of the company’s consolidated financial statements and the uncertainties that could impact the company’s financial position results of operations and cash flows 

  

  

 

  

  

  

revenue recognition snapon recognizes revenue from the sale of tools diagnostics and equipment solutions when contract terms are met collectibility is reasonably assured and a product is shipped or risk of ownership has been transferred to and accepted by the customer for sales contingent upon customer acceptance or product installation revenue recognition is deferred until such obligations are fulfilled estimated product returns are recorded as a reduction in reported revenues at the time of sale based upon historical product return experience and gross profit margin adjusted for known trends provisions for customer volume rebates discounts and allowances are also recorded as a reduction of reported revenues at the time of sale based on historical experience and known trends revenue related to maintenance and subscription agreements is recognized over the term of the agreement 

  

snapon also recognizes revenue related to multiple element arrangements including sales of software and softwarerelated services when a sales arrangement contains multiple elements such as hardware and software products andor services snapon uses vendor specific objective evidence “vsoe” of fair value to allocate revenue to each element based on its relative fair value and when necessary uses the residual method to assign value to the delivered elements when vsoe only exists for the undelivered elements snapon limits the amount of revenue recognition for delivered elements to the amount that is not contingent on the future delivery of products or services the amount assigned to future delivery of products or services is recognized when the product is delivered andor when the services are performed in instances where the product andor services are performed over an extended period as is the case with subscription agreements or the providing of ongoing support revenue is generally recognized on a straightline basis over the term of the agreement which generally ranges from 12 to 60 months 

  

financial services revenue snapon also generates revenue from various financing programs that include i loans to franchisees ii loans to franchisees’ customers and iii loans to snapon’s industrial and other customers for the purchase of tools and equipment on an extendedterm payment plan these financing programs are offered through soc a consolidated 50owned joint venture with cit and snapon’s wholly owned international finance subsidiaries financial services revenue consists of soc’s sales of originated contracts to cit and service fee income as well as installment contract revenue and franchisee loan receivable revenue derived from soc and snapon’s wholly owned international finance operations the decision to finance through snapon or another financing entity is solely at the election of the customer when assessing customers for potential financing snapon considers various factors regarding ability to pay including financial condition collateral debtservicing ability past payment experience and credit bureau information contracts originated by soc and subsequently sold to cit are also subject to the underwriting approval of cit 

  

financing revenue from soc is recognized primarily from the sale of originated contracts to cit soc continues to service these contracts based on an estimated servicing fee servicing fees are paid to soc by cit and such revenue is recognized over the contractual term of the loan with a portion of the servicing fee recognized at the time of origination financing revenue from originated loans that are retained is recognized over the life of the contract with interest computed on a daily basis 

  

snapon’s wholly owned international finance subsidiaries own the loans originated through their financing programs revenue from interest income is recognized over the life of the contract with interest computed on a daily basis 

  

franchise fee revenue including nominal nonrefundable initial and ongoing monthly fees primarily for sales and business training and marketing and product promotion programs is recognized as the fees are earned 

  

internally developed software costs incurred in the development of software that will ultimately be sold are capitalized from the time technological feasibility has been attained and ceases when the related product is ready for general release during 2008 2007 and 2006 the company capitalized 97 million 106 million and 50 million respectively of such costs amortization of capitalized software development costs was 82 million in 2008 49 million in 2007 and 25 million in 2006 unamortized capitalized software development costs were 255 million at january 3 2009 and 240 million at december 29 2007 

  

impairment of goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets  goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets are tested for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the assets might be impaired annual impairment tests are performed by the company in the second quarter of each fiscal year 

  

snapon evaluates the recoverability of goodwill by estimating the future discounted cash flows of the businesses to which the goodwill relates estimated cash flows and related goodwill are grouped at the reporting unit level a reporting unit is an operating segment or under certain circumstances a component of an operating segment that constitutes a business when estimated future discounted cash flows are less than the carrying value of the net assets and related goodwill an 

  

  

 

  

  

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued 

  

  

impairment test is performed to measure and recognize the amount of the impairment loss if any impairment losses which are limited to the carrying value of goodwill represent the excess of the carrying amount of a reporting unit’s goodwill over the implied fair value of that goodwill in determining the estimated future cash flows snapon considers current and projected future levels of income as well as business trends prospects and market and economic conditions impairment tests involve the use of judgmental estimates related to the fair market value of the business operations with which goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets are associated taking into consideration both historical operating performance and anticipated financial position and future earnings discounted by the company’s weighted average cost of capital 

  

snapon cannot predict the occurrence of certain events that might adversely affect the carrying value of goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets should the operations of the businesses with which goodwill or indefinitelived intangible assets are associated incur significant declines in profitability and cash flow in future years due to significant adverse changes in business climate adverse actions by regulators unanticipated competition loss of key customers andor changes in technology or markets some or all of the recorded goodwill or intangibles could be subject to impairment see note 6 to the consolidated financial statements for further information on goodwill and other intangible assets 

  

impairment of longlived and amortized intangible assets snapon performs impairment evaluations of its longlived assets including property plant and equipment and intangible assets with finite lives whenever business conditions or events indicate that those assets may be impaired when the estimated future undiscounted cash flows to be generated by the assets are less than the carrying value of the longlived assets the assets are written down to fair market value and a charge is recorded to current operations 

  

significant and unanticipated changes in circumstances such as significant adverse changes in business climate adverse actions by regulators unanticipated competition loss of key customers andor changes in technology or markets could require a provision for impairment in a future period 

  

allowance for doubtful accounts snapon evaluates the collectibility of receivables based on a combination of various financial and qualitative factors that may affect customers’ ability to pay these factors may include customers’ financial condition collateral debtservicing ability past payment experience and credit bureau information snapon does not believe that accounts receivable represent significant concentrations of credit risk because of its diversified portfolio of individual customers and geographical areas 

  

snapon regularly reviews the accounts receivable allowance estimation process and adjusts the allowances as appropriate in circumstances where the company is aware of a specific customer’s inability to meet its financial obligations a specific reserve is recorded against amounts due to reduce the net recognized receivable to the amount reasonably expected to be collected additional reserves are established based upon the company’s perception of the quality of the current receivables including the length of time the receivables are past due past experience of collectibility and underlying economic conditions if the financial condition of the company’s customers were to deteriorate resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments additional reserves would be required 

  

excess and obsolete inventory snapon records allowances for excess and obsolete inventory based on historical and estimated future demand and market conditions allowances for raw materials are largely based on an analysis of raw material age and actual physical inspection of raw material for fitness for use as part of evaluating the adequacy of allowances for workinprogress and finished goods management reviews individual product stockkeeping units skus by product category and product life cycle cost adjustments for each product categoryproduct lifecycle state are generally established and maintained based on a combination of historical experience forecasted sales and promotions technological obsolescence inventory age and other actual known conditions and circumstances should actual product marketability and raw material fitness for use be affected by conditions that are different from management estimates further adjustments to inventory allowances may be required 

  

warranty snapon’s policy is to record a liability for the expected cost of warrantyrelated claims at the time of sale the amount of warranty liability accrued reflects management’s best estimate of the expected future cost of honoring the company’s obligations under its warranty plans snapon calculates its accrual requirements based on historic warranty loss experience that is periodically adjusted for recent actual experience including the timing of claims during the warranty period and actual costs incurred if actual return rates andor repair and replacement costs differ significantly from our estimates adjustments to cost of sales may be required in future periods see note 15 to the consolidated financial statements for further information on warranty 

  

  

 

  

  

  

stockbased compensation snapon recognizes the cost of employee services in exchange for awards of equity instruments based on the grantdate fair value of those awards with limited exceptions that cost based on the estimated number of awards that are expected to vest is recognized on a straightline basis over the period during which the employee is required to provide the service in exchange for the award no compensation cost is recognized for awards for which employees do not render the requisite service the grantdate fair value of employee share options and similar instruments is estimated using the blackscholes valuation model

  

the blackscholes valuation model requires the input of subjective assumptions including the expected life of the stockbased award and stock price volatility the assumptions used are management’s best estimates but the estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management judgment as a result if other assumptions had been used the recorded stockbased compensation expense could have been materially different from that depicted in the financial statements see note 13 to the consolidated financial statements for further information on stockbased compensation 

  

pension benefits the pension benefit obligation and related pension expense are calculated in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards “sfas” no 87 “employer’s accounting for pensions” and are impacted by certain actuarial assumptions changes in these assumptions are primarily influenced by factors outside of snapon’s control and can have a significant effect on the amounts reported in the financial statements snapon believes that the two most critical assumptions are i the expected return on plan assets and ii the assumed discount rate

  

pension expense increases as the expected rate of return on plan assets decreases lowering the expected rate of return assumption for snapon’s domestic pension plan assets by 05 would have increased snapon’s 2008 domestic pension expense by approximately 36 million snapon uses a threeyear marketrelated value asset method of amortizing the difference between actual and expected returns on its us plan assets 

  

the objective of snapon’s discount rate assumption is to reflect the rate at which the pension benefits could be effectively settled in making this determination the company takes into account the timing and amount of benefits that would be available under the plans the methodology for selecting the discount rate as of yearend 2008 was to match the plan’s cash flows to that of a theoretical bond portfolio yield curve that provides the equivalent yields on zerocoupon bonds with an aa rating or better for each maturity the selection of the 63 weightedaverage discount rate for snapon’s domestic pension plans represents the single rate that produces the same present value of cash flows as the estimated benefit plan payments lowering snapon’s domestic discount rate assumption by 05 would have increased snapon’s 2008 domestic pension expense and projected benefit obligation by approximately 08 million and 403 million respectively at yearend 2008 snapon’s domestic projected benefit obligation comprised approximately 85 of snapon’s worldwide projected benefit obligation 

  

actuarial gains and losses in excess of 10 percent of the greater of the projected benefit obligation or marketrelated value of assets are amortized on a straightline basis over the average remaining service period of active participants prior service costs resulting from plan amendments are amortized in equal annual amounts over the average remaining service period of affected active participants or over the remaining life expectancy of affected retired participants see note 11 to the consolidated financial statements for further information on pension benefits 

  

postretirement benefits   snapon’s postretirement benefits obligation and related expense are calculated in accordance with sfas no 106 “employers’ accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions” and are impacted by certain actuarial assumptions including health care trend rates an increase of one percentage point in health care costs would increase the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation by 15 million and would increase the annual service and interest cost by 01 million a corresponding decrease of one percentage point would decrease the accumulated postretirement benefit by 14 million and decrease the annual service and interest cost by 01 million see note 12 to the consolidated financial statements for further information on postretirement plans

  

income taxes snapon records deferred income tax assets and liabilities for differences between the book basis and tax basis of the related net assets snapon records a valuation allowance when appropriate to reduce its deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized while the company has considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance if these estimates and assumptions change in the future the company may be required to adjust its valuation allowance this could result in a charge to or an increase in income in the period such determination is made

  

  

 

  

  

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued 

  

in addition the company operates within multiple taxing jurisdictions and is subject to audit in these jurisdictions the company records accruals for the estimated outcomes of these audits and the accruals may change in the future due to new developments in each matter see note 8 to the consolidated financial statements for further information on income taxes 

  

outlook 

  

the challenges posed by the global economy increased significantly during the fourth quarter furthering the impact on snapon’s sales of higher priced products such as tool storage and vehicle repair equipment additional slowdowns in the economies of europe particularly southern europe negatively impacted volume at the company’s europeanbased tools business furthermore the general economic difficulties are now spreading across more industries and to additional geographies creating more widespread pressure on business activity in the near term snapon anticipates no change in this environment and as a result expects sales and credit originations in the first quarter of 2009 to be down year over year 

  

additional headwinds in 2009 now include approximately 30 million per quarter of higher yearoveryear pension expense due to declines in pension asset values assuming foreign currency exchange rates remain at recent levels the company also anticipates approximately 80 million of unfavorable foreign exchange impact on first quarter operating earnings 

  

snapon believes that its business models are sound and that it continues to maintain and expand its strong brand positions when coupled with its innovation processes snapon believes that these strengths have enabled the advancement of its market position in 2008 the company expects to benefit from those strengths in 2009 and to improve its strategic position going forward snapon also expects further benefits in 2009 from its rci sourcing and other cost reduction initiatives that will help to limit the impact of any volume decline 

  

snapon does not as a general practice furnish quarterly sales or earnings projections however in light of these factors and conditions the company believes that first quarter 2009 sales and earnings will be lower than reported first quarter 2008 amounts 

  

snapon is responding to the global macroeconomic challenges by deepening and accelerating its rci and cost reduction initiatives snapon recorded 67 million of restructuring costs in the fourth quarter of 2008 bringing fullyear 2008 restructuring costs to 147 million snapon expects to incur approximately 12 million to 16 million of restructuring costs in full year 2009 snapon is also continuing and accelerating a number of its planned growth investments including further expansion of its manufacturing capacity in china and in eastern europe as a result capital expenditures in 2009 are expected to be in a range of 75 million to 80 million snapon views these investments as potentially enabling nearterm growth for full year 2009 snapon anticipates that its effective income tax rate on earnings before equity earnings and minority interests will approximate 34 

  

in 2009 snapon will continue to aggressively manage the balance between investing and capturing growth opportunities with the need for cost reduction actions beyond those already implemented the current economic uncertainty makes it extremely difficult to presently predict this balance as the company continually adjusts to the challenging business environment 

  

  

 

  

  

  




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

  

market credit and economic risks 

  

market risk is the potential economic loss that may result from adverse changes in the fair value of financial instruments snapon is exposed to market risk from changes in both foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates snapon monitors its exposure to these risks and attempts to manage the underlying economic exposures through the use of financial instruments such as interest rate swap foreign exchange and treasury lock agreements snapon does not use derivative instruments for speculative or trading purposes snapon’s broadbased business activities help to reduce the impact that volatility in any particular area or related areas may have on its operating earnings as a whole snapon’s management takes an active role in the risk management process and has developed policies and procedures that require specific administrative and business functions to assist in the identification assessment and control of various risks   foreign currency risk management 

  

snapon has significant international operations and is subject to certain risks inherent with foreign operations that include currency fluctuations and restrictions on movement of funds foreign exchange risk exists to the extent that snapon has payment obligations or receipts denominated in currencies other than the functional currency to manage these exposures snapon identifies naturally offsetting positions and then generally purchases hedging instruments to protect the residual net exposures see note 10 to the consolidated financial statements for information on foreign currency risk management 

  

interest rate risk management 

  

snapon’s interest rate risk management policies are designed to reduce the potential volatility of earnings that could arise from changes in interest rates through the use of interest rate swaps snapon aims to stabilize funding costs by managing the exposure created by the differing maturities and interest rate structures of snapon’s assets and liabilities snapon also enters into treasury lock agreements to manage the risk associated with changing benchmark interest rates on its extended contract installment loans that are sold to cit see note 10 to the consolidated financial statements for information on interest rate risk management 

  

snapon utilizes a valueatrisk “var” model to determine the potential oneday loss in the fair value of its interest rate and foreign exchangesensitive financial instruments from adverse changes in market factors the var model estimates were made assuming normal market conditions and a 95 confidence level snapon’s computations are based on the interrelationships among movements in various currencies and interest rates variancecovariance technique these interrelationships were determined by observing interest rate and foreign currency market changes over the preceding quarter 

  

the estimated maximum potential oneday loss in fair value calculated using the var model at january 3 2009 was 12 million on interest ratesensitive financial instruments and 19 million on foreign currencysensitive financial instruments the var model is a risk management tool and does not purport to represent actual losses in fair value that will be incurred by snapon nor does it consider the potential effect of favorable changes in market factors 

  

  

 

  

  

  

credit risk

snapon is exposed to credit losses in the event of nonperformance by the counterparties to various financial agreements including its interest rate swap foreign exchange and treasury lock agreements snapon does not obtain collateral or other security to support financial instruments subject to credit risk but monitors the credit standing of the counterparties and enters into agreements only with financial institution counterparties with a credit rating of a or better snapon does not anticipate nonperformance by its counterparties 

  

economic risk 

  

economic risk is the possibility of loss resulting from economic instability in certain areas of the world snapon continually monitors its exposure in these markets 

  

as a result of the above market credit and economic risks net income and revenues in any particular period may not be representative of fullyear results and may vary significantly from year to year inflation has not had a significant impact on the company 

  

commodity risk 

  

the company is a purchaser of certain commodities such as steel natural gas and electricity the company is also a purchaser of components and parts that are integrated into the company’s end products as well as the purchaser of certain finished goods all of which may contain various commodities including steel aluminum and others snapon’s supply of raw materials and purchased components are generally and readily available from numerous suppliers 

  

the principal raw material used in the manufacture of our products is steel which we purchase in competitive pricesensitive markets to meet snapon’s high quality standards our steel needs range from specialized alloys which are available only from a limited group of approved suppliers to commodity types of alloys these raw materials have historically exhibited price and demand cyclicality some of these materials have been and in the future may be in short supply as some steel alloys require specialized manufacturing procedures we could experience inventory shortages if we were required to use an alternative manufacturer on short notice additionally unexpected price increases could result in higher prices to our customers or an erosion of the margins on our products 

  

we believe our ability to sell our products is also dependent on the number of vehicles on the road the number of miles driven and the general aging of vehicles these factors affect the frequency type and amount of service and repair performed on vehicles by technicians and therefore affect the demand for the number of technicians the prosperity of the technicians and subsequently the demand the technicians have for our tools other products and services and the value they place on those products and services to the extent that gasoline prices increase consumers may turn to other nongasoline based methods of transportation including more frequent use of public transportation a decrease in the use of gasoline consuming vehicles may lead to fewer repairs and less demand for our products 

  

  

 

  

  

  

to the extent that commodity prices increase and the company does not have firm pricing agreements with its suppliers the company may experience margin declines to the extent that it is not able to increase the selling prices of its products

sales and distribution 

  

snapon markets and distributes its products and related services principally to professional tool and equipment users around the world the two largest market sectors are the vehicle service and repair sector and the industrial sector 

  

vehicle service and repair sector 

  

the vehicle service and repair sector has three main customer groups i professional technicians who purchase tools and equipment for themselves ii vehicle service and repair shop owners and managers  including independent shops national chains and automotive dealerships  who purchase tools equipment and diagnostics products for use by multiple technicians within a service or repair facility and iii oems 

  

snapon provides innovative tool equipment and business solutions as well as technical sales support and training to meet technicians’ evolving needs snapon’s franchise van distribution system offers technicians the convenience of purchasing quality tools with minimal disruption of their work routine snapon also provides owners and managers of shops where technicians work with tools diagnostics equipment repair and service information including electronic parts catalogs and shop management products through its equipment solutions “oem facilitation” business snapon provides oems with products and services including tools consulting services and facilitation services snapon’s facilitation services include product procurement distribution and administrative support to customers for their dealership equipment programs 

  

major challenges for snapon and the vehicle service and repair sector include the increasing rate of technological change within motor vehicles vehicle population growth vehicle life and the resulting impact on the businesses of both our suppliers and customers that is necessitated by such change snapon believes it is a meaningful participant in the market sector for vehicle service and repair 

  

industrial sector 

  

snapon markets its products globally to a broad crosssection of industrial and commercial customers including maintenance and repair operations manufacturing and assembly facilities various government agencies facilities and operations including military operations vocational and technical schools aerospace and aviation oem and repair customers oil and gas developers mining operations energy and power generation equipment fabricators agriculture infrastructure construction companies and other customers that require instrumentation service tools andor equipment for their products

major challenges in the industrial sector include a highly competitive costconscious environment and a trend toward customers making many of their tool and equipment purchases through one integrated supplier snapon believes it is a meaningful participant in the market sector for industrial tools and equipment 

  

distribution channels 

  

snapon serves customers primarily through the following channels of distribution the mobile franchise van channel companydirect sales distributors and ecommerce the following discussion summarizes snapon’s general approach for each channel and is not intended to be allinclusive 

  

  

franchisees 

  

in the united states the majority of sales to the vehicle service and repair sector are conducted through snapon’s franchise van distribution system snapon’s franchisees primarily serve vehicle service technicians and vehicle service shop owners generally providing weekly contact at the customer’s place of business franchisees’ sales are concentrated in hand and power tools tool storage units small diagnostic and shop equipment and diagnostics and repair information products which can easily be transported in a van and demonstrated during a brief sales call franchisees purchase snapon’s products at a discount from suggested list prices and resell them at prices established by the franchisee most us franchisees are provided a list of places of business that serves as the basis of the franchisee’s sales route although some franchisees have sales areas defined by other methods 

  

snapon also offers a trial franchise option – termed the “gateway program” – to potential us franchisees that do not meet the franchise qualification requirements gateway program participants have less upfront investment and are provided an initial base level of consigned inventory from snapon to assist them in gaining experience and building equity toward the future purchase of a standard franchise snapon also provides certain franchisees the opportunity to add vans to their franchise or to add a limited number of franchises snapon charges nominal initial and ongoing monthly license fees since 1991 new us franchisees and a majority of the pre1991 us franchisees have been enrolled as franchisees of snapon at 2007 year end 3269 us franchisees approximately 96 were enrolled as franchisees or employed by franchisees as compared with 3308 us franchisees approximately 95 at yearend 2006 

  

snapon has replicated its us franchise van distribution model in certain other countries including australia canada japan the netherlands south africa and the united kingdom in many of these markets as in the united states purchase decisions are generally made or influenced by professional vehicle service technicians and shop owners snapon markets products in certain other countries through its subsidiary snapon tools international llc which sells to foreign distributors under license or contract with snapon 

  

through soc financing is available to us franchisees including financing for van and truck leases working capital loans and loans to enable new franchisees to fund the purchase of the franchise internationally snapon offers financing to its franchisees and customer networks through its wholly owned finance subsidiaries while snapon offers financing to qualified franchisees and their customers through soc and its wholly owned international finance subsidiaries the decision to finance through snapon or another financing entity is solely at the election of the customer 

  

snapon supports its franchisees with a field organization of regional offices franchise performance teams diagnostic sales developers “dsds” service centers and distribution centers snapon also provides sales and business training and marketing and product promotion programs as well as customer and franchisee financing programs through soc and its wholly owned international finance subsidiaries all of which are designed to strengthen franchisee sales in the united states and canada the national franchise advisory council and the snapon tools canadian franchise advisory council both of which are composed of franchisees that are elected by franchisees assist snapon in identifying and implementing enhancements to the franchise program 

  

in the united states franchisees work closely with the dsds the dsd specialists demonstrate and sell higherpricepoint diagnostics and vehicle service shop management information systems dsds work independently and with franchisees to identify and generate sales leads among vehicle service shop owners and managers dsds are snapon employees who beginning in 2008 are compensated through a combination of base salary and commission a franchisee receives a brokerage fee from certain sales made by the dsds to the franchisee’s customers most products sold through franchisees and the dsds are sold under the snapon  bluepoint and sun brand names 

  

company direct sales 

  

in the united states a significant proportion of shop equipment sales under the sun john bean and blackhawk brands and information products under the mitchell1 brand are made by a direct sales force that has responsibility for national accounts as the vehicle service and repair sector consolidates with more business conducted by national chains automotive dealerships and franchised service centers the company believes these larger organizations can be serviced 

  

  

most effectively by sales people who can demonstrate and sell the full line of equipment and diagnostic products and services snapon also sells these products and services directly to oems 

  

snapon brand tools and equipment are marketed to industrial and governmental customers in the united states through both industrial sales representatives who are employees and independent industrial distributors in most markets outside the united states industrial sales are conducted through independent distributors the sales representatives focus on industrial customers whose main purchase criteria are quality and service at the end of 2007 snapon had industrial sales representatives in the united states australia canada japan mexico puerto rico and some european asian latin american and middle eastern countries with the united states representing the majority of snapon’s total industrial sales 

  

business solutions sells automotive power equipment and power sports software solutions both domestically and internationally through an internal sales force products and services are marketed to two targeted groups oems and individual dealerships to effectively reach the large oems in the automotive segment such as general motors corporation daimler ag ford motor company chrysler llc and toyota motor corporation business solutions has deployed a team of business development professionals in the world’s principal automotive centers in the united states the united kingdom germany italy france spain and japan in the united states and canada automotive products and services are sold directly to individual dealerships using an experienced sales force in reaching customers such as john deere deere  company jc bamford excavators ltd jcb and yamaha corporation of america yamaha in the power equipment and power sports segments teams are also positioned to support the 90 brands that business solutions distributes to globally business management solutions are sold directly to the automotive oems in the united states and throughout europe including the united kingdom

examples of products that have features or designs that benefit from patent protection include wheel alignment systems wheel balancers tire changers lifts test lanes sealed ratchets electronic torque instruments ratcheting screwdrivers emissionssensing devices and diagnostic equipment 

  

much of the technology used in the manufacture of vehicle service tools and equipment is in the public domain snapon relies primarily on trade secret protection to protect proprietary processes used in manufacturing methods and processes are patented when appropriate copyright protection is also utilized when appropriate 

  

trademarks used by snapon are of continuing importance to snapon in the marketplace trademarks have been registered in the united states and more than 100 other countries and additional applications for trademark registrations are pending snapon vigorously polices proper use of its trademarks snapon’s right to manufacture and sell certain products is dependent upon licenses from others however these products under license do not represent a material portion of snapon’s net sales 

  

domain names have become a valuable corporate asset for companies around the world including snapon domain names often contain a trademark or service mark or even a corporate name and are often considered intellectual property the recognition and value of the snapon name trademark and domain name are core strengths of the company 

  

snapon is selectively and strategically licensing the snapon brand to carefully selected manufacturing and distribution companies for items such as apparel work boots and a variety of other goods in order to further build equity and market presence for the company’s strongest brand 

  

  

environment 

  

snapon is subject to various environmental laws ordinances regulations and other requirements of government authorities in the united states and other nations at snapon these environmental liabilities are managed through the snapon environmental hygiene and safety management system “eh  sms” which is applied worldwide the system is based upon continual improvement and is certified to iso 140011996 and ohsas 180011999 verified through det norske veritas dnv certification inc 

  

snapon believes that it complies with applicable environmental control requirements in its operations expenditures on environmental matters through eh  sms have not had and snapon does not for the foreseeable future expect them to have a material effect upon snapon’s capital expenditures earnings or competitive position 

  

employees 

  

at the end of january 2008 snapon employed approximately 11600 people compared to approximately 12400 people at the end of january 2007 the yearoveryear decrease primarily reflects the impacts of restructuringrelated and management realignment actions at various snapon facilities as well as the june 2007 sale of a nonstrategic business based in the netherlands 

  

approximately 3100 employees or 27 of snapon’s worldwide workforce are represented by unions andor covered under collective bargaining agreements approximately 1100 employees are covered under agreements expiring in 2008 in recent years snapon has not experienced any significant work slowdowns stoppages or other labor disruptions 

  

the number of covered union employees whose contracts expire within the next five years approximates 1100 employees in 2008 500 employees in 2009 650 employees in 2010 100 employees in 2011 and zero employees in 2012 

  

there can be no assurance that future contracts with snapon’s unions will be renegotiated upon terms acceptable to snapon 

  

working capital 

  

as most of snapon’s business is not seasonal and its inventory needs are relatively constant no unusual working capital needs arise during the year snapon did not have a significant backlog of orders at december 29 2007 

  

snapon’s financial condition and use of working capital are discussed herein in “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” 

  

neither snapon nor any of its segments except financial services depend on any single customer small group of customers or government for any material part of its revenues as a result of soc’s relationship with cit snapon’s financial services segment depends on cit for more than 10 of its revenues 

  




 item 1a risk factors   in evaluating the company careful consideration should be given to the following risk factors in addition to the other information included in this annual report on form 10k including the consolidated financial statements and the related notes each of these risk factors could adversely affect the company’s business operating results cash flows andor financial condition as well as adversely affect the value of an investment in the company’s common stock 

  

the success of snapon’s mobile van tool distribution business depends on the success of its franchisees 

  

approximately 38 of our 2007 revenues were generated by the snapon tools group which consists of snapon’s business operations serving the worldwide franchise van channel except in limited circumstances each of our mobile tool vans is operated by a franchisee pursuant to a franchise agreement snapon’s success is dependent on its relationships with franchisees individually and collectively as they are the primary sales and service link between the company and vehicle service and repair technicians who are an important class of end users for snapon’s products and services if our franchisees are not successful or if we do not maintain an effective relationship with our franchisees the delivery of products the collection of receivables andor our relationship with end users could be adversely affected and thereby negatively impact our financial results 

  

  

in addition if we are unable to maintain effective relationships with franchisees the company or the franchisees may choose to terminate the relationship which may result in i open routes in which enduse customers are not provided reliable service ii litigation resulting from termination andor iii reduced collections or increased writeoffs of franchisee receivables owed to snapon as snapon has approximately 4700 franchisees worldwide and most of these franchise relationships are governed by contract it is not uncommon for litigation to result from the termination of these relationships 

  

we may not successfully integrate businesses we acquire which could have an adverse impact on our results of operations and financial position 

  

if we pursue future growth through further acquisitions including participation in joint ventures this would involve significant risks that could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial position these risks include 

  

·   loss of the acquired businesses’ customers 

·   an inability to integrate successfully the acquired businesses’ operations 

·   inability to coordinate management and integrate and retain employees of the acquired businesses 

·   difficulties in implementing and maintaining consistent standards controls procedures policies and information systems 

·   failure to realize anticipated synergies economies of scale or other anticipated benefits or to maintain operating margins 

·   strain on our personnel systems and resources and diversion of attention from other priorities 

·   incurrence of additional debt and related interest expense 

·   the dilutive effect of the issuance of additional equity securities 

·   unforeseen or contingent liabilities of the acquired businesses and 

·   large writeoffs or writedowns or the impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets 

  

information technology infrastructure is critical to supporting business objectives 

  

we depend heavily on information technology infrastructure to achieve our business objectives if a problem occurs that impairs this infrastructure the resulting disruption could impede our ability to record or process orders manufacture and ship in a timely manner or otherwise carry on business in the normal course any such events could cause us to lose customers or revenue and could require us to incur significant expense to remediate 

  

in association with initiatives to better integrate business units rationalize operating footprint and improve responsiveness to franchisees and customers snapon is replacing and enhancing its existing global enterprise resource planning erp management information system the integration implementation and deployment of new information technology processes and a common information infrastructure which began in 2006 is occurring over a multiyear period we could experience disruptions in our business as we implement the system enhancements which could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

  

the recognition of impairment charges on goodwill or other intangible assets would adversely impact future financial position and results of operations 

  

we are required to perform impairment tests on our goodwill and other intangibles annually or at any time when events occur which could impact the value of our business segments our determination of whether impairment has occurred is based on a comparison of each of our reporting units’ fair market value with its carrying value significant and unanticipated changes could require a provision for impairment in a future period that could substantially affect our reported earnings and reduce our consolidated net worth and shareholders’ equity 

  

  

the steps taken to restructure operations rationalize operating footprint lower operating expenses and achieve greater efficiencies in the supply chain could disrupt business 

  

we have taken steps in the past and expect to take additional steps in 2008 intended to improve customer service and to drive further efficiencies and reduce costs some of which could be disruptive to our business these actions collectively across our operating groups are focused on the following 

  

·   continue on the company’s existing path to improve and transform global manufacturing and the supply chain into a marketdemandbased replenishment system with lower costs 

·   continue to enhance service and value to snapon’s franchisees and customers 

·   continue to invest in initiatives focused on building a strong sales and operating presence in emerging growth markets 

·   continue to implement rci activities throughout the organization to drive further efficiencies and reduce costs 

·   continue to invest in developing and marketing new innovative highervalueadded products and advanced technologies and 

·   extend snapon’s products and services into additional andor adjacent markets or to new customers 

  

specific initiatives in each of these areas are underway snapon believes that by executing on these focus areas along with a continued commitment to new innovative products and rci to drive higher levels of productivity and lower costs the company and its franchisees will realize stronger growth and profitability however failure to succeed in the implementation of any or all of these actions could result in an inability to achieve our financial goals and could be disruptive to the business 

  

in addition reductions to headcount and other cost reduction measures may result in the loss of technical expertise that could adversely affect our research and development efforts and ability to meet product development schedules efforts to reduce components of expense could result in the recording of charges for inventory and technologyrelated writeoffs workforce reduction costs or other charges relating to the consolidation of facilities if we were to incur a substantial charge to further these efforts our earnings or loss per share would be adversely affected in such period if we are unable to effectively manage our cost reduction and restructuring efforts our business results of operations and financial condition could be harmed 

  

exposure to credit risks of customers and resellers may make it difficult to collect receivables and could adversely affect operating results and financial condition 

  

industry and economic conditions have the potential to weaken the financial position of some of our customers if circumstances surrounding our customers’ financial capabilities were to deteriorate such writedowns or writeoffs would negatively affect our operating results for the period in which they occur and if large could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition 

  

failure to maintain effective distribution of products and services could adversely impact revenue gross margin and profitability 

  

we use a variety of distribution methods to sell our products and services successfully managing the interaction of our distribution efforts to reach various potential customer segments for our products and services is a complex process moreover since each distribution method has distinct risks and gross margins our failure to implement the most advantageous balance in the delivery model for our products and services could adversely affect our revenue and gross margins and therefore our profitability 

  

risks associated with the disruption of manufacturing operations could adversely affect profitability or competitive position 

  

we manufacture a significant portion of the products we sell any prolonged disruption in the operations of our existing manufacturing facilities whether due to technical or labor difficulties lack of raw material or component availability destruction of or damage to any facility including natural disasters use and storage of hazardous materials or other events or other reasons could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

  

  

the inability to provide acceptable financing alternatives to enduser customers and franchisees could adversely impact operating results 

  

an integral component of snapon’s business and profitability is its ability to offer financing alternatives to enduser customers and franchisees which for its domestic financing operations are managed through a joint venture with cit historically cit has been the exclusive purchaser of the credit and installment financing arranged by soc a deterioration of the relationship between the joint venture partners or if the joint venture should be unexpectedly dissolved could have an adverse impact on snapon’s results of operations and ability to provide financing to enduser customers and franchisees in the united states adverse fluctuations in interest rates andor the ability to provide competitive financing programs could also have an adverse impact on snapon’s revenue and profitability 

  

the global tool equipment and diagnostics and repair industry is competitive 

  

we face strong competition in all of our market segments price competition in our various industries is intense and pricing pressures from competitors and customers are increasing in general as a manufacturer and marketer of premium products and services the expectations of snapon’s customers and its franchisees are high and increasing any inability to maintain customer satisfaction could diminish snapon’s premium image and reputation and could result in a lessening of its ability to command premium pricing we expect that the level of competition will remain high in the future which could limit our ability to maintain or increase market share or profitability 

  

the inability to continue to introduce new products that respond to customer needs and achieve market acceptance could result in lower revenues and reduced profitability 

  

sales from new products represent a significant portion of our net sales and are expected to continue to represent a significant component of our future net sales we may not be able to compete effectively unless we continue to enhance existing products or introduce new products to the marketplace in a timely manner product improvements and new product introductions require significant financial and other resources including significant planning design development and testing at the technological product and manufacturing process levels our competitors’ new products may beat our products to market be more effective with more features be less expensive than our products andor render our products obsolete any new products that we develop may not receive market acceptance or otherwise generate any meaningful net sales or profits for us relative to our expectations based on among other things existing and anticipated investments in manufacturing capacity and commitments to fund advertising marketing promotional programs and research and development 

  

economic conditions and world events could affect our operating results 

  

we our franchisees and our customers may be adversely affected by an economic downturn such as changes in consumer and investor confidence volatile corporate profits and reduced business and consumer spending we our franchisees and customers and the economy as a whole also may be affected by future world events such as acts of terrorism developments in the war on terrorism conflicts in the middle east and other international situations and by natural disasters these factors may affect our results of operations by reducing our sales margins andor net income as a result of a slowdown in customer orders or order cancellations in addition political and social turmoil related to international conflicts and terrorist acts may put further pressure on economic conditions abroad unstable political social and economic conditions may make it difficult for our franchisees customers suppliers and us to accurately forecast and plan future business activities if such conditions persist our business financial condition results of operations and cash flow could be negatively affected 

  

raw material and energy price fluctuations and shortages including steel and various fuel sources could adversely affect the ability to obtain needed manufacturing materials and could adversely affect results of operations 

  

the principal raw material used in the manufacture of our products is steel which we purchase in competitive pricesensitive markets to meet snapon’s high quality standards our steel needs range from specialized alloys which are available only from a limited group of approved suppliers to commodity types of alloys these raw materials have historically exhibited price and demand cyclicality some of these materials have been and in the future may be in short supply as some steel alloys require specialized manufacturing procedures we could experience inventory shortages if we were required to use an alternative manufacturer on short notice additionally unexpected price increases could result in higher prices to our customers or an erosion of the margins on our products 

  

  

we believe our ability to sell our products is also dependent on the number of vehicles on the road the number of miles driven and the general aging of vehicles these factors affect the frequency type and amount of service and repair performed on vehicles by technicians and therefore affect the demand for the number of technicians the prosperity of the technicians and subsequently the demand technicians have for our tools other products and services and the value technicians place on those products and services to the extent that gasoline prices increase consumers may turn to other nongasoline based methods of transportation including more frequent use of public transportation a decrease in the use of gasoline consuming vehicles may lead to fewer repairs and less demand for our products 

  

we use various energy sources to transport produce and distribute products and some of our products have components that are petroleum based petroleum and energy prices have recently been volatile and have generally increased further volatility and increases may be caused by market fluctuations supply and demand currency fluctuation production and transportation disruption world events and changes in governmental programs price increases raise both our operating costs and the costs of our materials and we may not be able to increase our prices enough to offset these costs higher prices also may reduce the level of future customer orders and our profitability 

  

our operations expose us to the risk of environmental liabilities costs litigation and violations that could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and reputation 

  

certain of our operations are subject to environmental laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which they operate which impose limitations on the discharge of pollutants into the ground air and water and establish standards for the generation treatment use storage and disposal of hazardous wastes we must also comply with various health and safety regulations in the united states and abroad in connection with our operations failure to comply with any of these laws could result in civil and criminal monetary and nonmonetary penalties and damage to our reputation in addition we may incur costs related to remedial efforts or alleged environmental damage associated with past or current waste disposal practices we cannot provide assurance that our costs of complying with current or future environmental protection and health and safety laws will not exceed our estimates or adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

  

foreign operations are subject to currency exchange political and other risks that could adversely affect results of operations 

  

approximately 43 of our revenues in 2007 were generated outside of the united states future growth rates and success of our business depends in large part on continued growth in our nonus operations including growth in emerging markets numerous risks and uncertainties affect our nonus operations these risks and uncertainties include political economic and social instability including acts of war civil disturbance or acts of terrorism local labor conditions changes in government policies and regulations including imposition or increases in withholding and other taxes on remittances and other payments by international subsidiaries transportation delays or interruptions and difficulties in enforcement of contract and intellectual property rights we are also affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates inflation rates and interest rates additionally cash generated in nonus jurisdictions may be difficult to repatriate to the united states in a taxefficient manner our foreign operations are also subject to other risks and challenges such as the need to staff and manage diverse workforces respond to the needs of multiple national and international marketplaces and differing business climates and cultures in various countries 

  

failure to adequately protect intellectual property could adversely affect business 

  

intellectual property rights are an important and integral component of our business we attempt to protect our intellectual property rights through a combination of patent trademark copyright and trade secret laws as well as licensing agreements and thirdparty nondisclosure and assignment agreements adverse determinations in a judicial or administrative proceeding could prevent us from manufacturing and selling our products or prevent us from stopping others from manufacturing and selling competing products failure to obtain or maintain adequate protection of our intellectual property rights for any reason could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

  

the inability to successfully defend claims from taxing authorities could adversely affect operating results and financial position 

  

we conduct business in many countries which requires us to interpret the income tax laws and rulings in each of those taxing jurisdictions due to the subjectivity of tax laws between those jurisdictions as well as the subjectivity of factual 

  

  

interpretations our estimates of income tax liabilities may differ from actual payments or assessments claims from taxing authorities related to these differences could have an adverse impact on our operating results and financial position 

  

failure to attract and retain qualified personnel could lead to a loss of revenue andor profitability 

  

snapon’s success depends in part on the efforts and abilities of its senior management team and other key employees their skills experience and industry contacts significantly benefit our operations and administration the failure to attract and retain members of our senior management team and other key employees could have a negative effect on our operating results in addition transitions of important responsibilities to new individuals inherently include the possibility of disruptions to our business and operations which could negatively affect our operating results and financial position 

  

failure to achieve expected investment returns on pension plan assets as well as changes in interest rates could adversely impact our results of operations financial position and cash flow 

  

snapon sponsors various pension benefit plans the assets of the pension plans are broadly diversified in an attempt to mitigate the risk of a large loss the assets are invested in equity securities fixed income securities real estate and other real assets other alternative investments and cash required funding for the company’s defined benefit pension plans is determined in accordance with guidelines set forth in the federal employee retirement income security act erisa additional contributions to enhance the funded status of the pension plans can be made at the company’s discretion however there can be no assurance that the value of the pension plan assets or the investment returns on those plan assets will be sufficient to meet the future benefit obligations of such plans in addition during periods of adverse investment market conditions and declining interest rates the company may be required to make additional cash contributions to the plans that would reduce our financial flexibility 

  

our defined benefit pension plan obligations are affected by changes in market interest rates significant fluctuations in market interest rates will add volatility to our pension plan obligations declining market interest rates will increase our pension plan obligations while our plan assets are broadly diversified there is inherent market risks associated with investments if adverse market conditions develop our plan assets could incur a loss the combination of declining market interest rates and plan asset investment losses may adversely impact our financial position and results of operations 

  

the company’s defined benefit pension expense is calculated by netting five factors i service cost ii interest on projected benefit obligations iii the expected return on plan assets iv the amortization of prior service costs and v the effects of actuarial gains and losses the accounting for pensions involves the estimation of a number of factors that are highly uncertain certain factors such as the interest cost and the expected return on plan assets are impacted by changes in market interest rates and the value of plan assets a significant decrease in market interest rates and a decrease in the fair value of plan assets would increase net pension expense and may adversely affect the company’s future results of operations see note 11 to the consolidated financial statements for further information on the company’s pension benefit plans

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

  

management overview 

  

in 2007 snapon continued to implement strategic initiatives intended to create longterm value for company shareholders associates franchisees and other distributor partners across all of its business segments and channels during the year snapon believes it made measurable progress on many fronts 

  

net sales grew 157 year over year with sales increases in each segment operating earnings of 3248 million in 2007 nearly doubled from 1628 million in 2006 higher sales increased income from financial services and improved operating expense margins from ongoing efficiency productivity and cost reduction collectively “rapid continuous improvement” or “rci” initiatives along with the absence of the 2006 franchisee litigation settlement cost all contributed to the significant yearoveryear earnings improvement 

  

our strategic priorities and plans for 2008 will continue to build on the improvement initiatives underway to achieve sustainable profitable growth through increased sales and lower costs 

  

in the commercial  industrial group  higher sales including growth in emerging markets combined with expense control and savings from restructuring initiatives to deliver continued improvements in operating performance segment net sales in 2007 were up 133 and operating earnings were up 238 

  

benefits from ongoing cost reduction and rci initiatives including increased production and sourcing of materials from lowercost regions and facilities were major contributors to the yearoveryear earnings improvement as a result of continued sales growth improved levels of customer service and savings from rci and restructuring activities operating earnings increased to 1315 million in 2007 

  

the commercial  industrial group expects to continue to build on the following strategic priorities in 2008 

  

·   continue to invest in emerging market growth initiatives such as china india and eastern europe 

  

·   increase market share in key industrial market segments by reaching new customers building business with existing customers and continually improving order fill rates 

  

·   continued innovation in productivityenhancing products that utilize increasingly advanced technology 

  

·   continue to pursue key large customers that offer longterm growth potential and 

  

·   continue to rationalize the operating footprint and shift manufacturing activities to lowercost regions 

  

in the snapon tools group  considerable progress on fundamental strategic initiatives strengthened company operating and financial performance as well as franchisee performance and satisfaction 

  

higher sales of a midtier brand of tools and equipment blue point a relaunch of the company’s warehouse distribution program and a more focused promotional program all contributed to the 81 sales growth in 2007 supply chain improvements and an ongoing transition to a marketdemandbased replenishment system continued to improve complete and ontime delivery of a broad assortment of products operating earnings of 1251 million in 2007 improved significantly from prioryear levels primarily due to contributions from the higher sales and benefits from ongoing cost reduction and rci initiatives as well as the absence of the 380 million franchisee litigation settlement charge in 2006 

  

  

  

the snapon tools group expects to continue to build on the progress made in enhancing the franchise proposition and delivering customer productivity solutions with specific initiatives in 2008 focused on the following 

  

·   continue to improve franchisee profitability and satisfaction 

·   improve service to existing customers 

·   introduce programs to capture unserved customers 

·   continued new product innovation and development 

·   continually improve the supply chain through investments in manufacturing and use of rci and 

·   integrate customer driven pullmarketing initiatives 

  

by executing in these areas snapon believes the company and its franchisees will continue to serve more customers better and more profitably 

  

in the diagnostics  information group  significant progress was realized across many facets of the business in 2007 segment sales increased 285 to over 650 million despite lower original equipment manufacturers “oem” facilitation sales due primarily to the wind down of a major facilitation program in europe and the outsourcing of certain nonstrategic lowmargin products previously manufactured for the snapon tools group 

  

the integration of the snapon business solutions “business solutions” acquisition which was acquired november 28 2006 provided an opportunity to successfully build closer relationships with key oem customers and strengthen snapon’s position as a provider of productivity solutions new product and program offerings coupled with a renewed focus and dedication to customer delivery were rewarded with solid sales growth integrating snapon’s rci initiatives also drove improved operating cost leverage 

  

the diagnostics equipment and software business as well as the shop management business grew through the development and launch of new hardware and software products targeted at a broader and growing customer base focus on rci initiatives also achieved strong cost reduction and improved inventory turns 

  

the diagnostics  information group expects to build on the following strategic priorities in 2008 

  

·   continued growth in the base business and emerging markets 

·   further leveraging of customer relationships and product and service offerings and 

·   continued innovation in new products and services

financial condition 

  

snapon’s growth has historically been funded by a combination of cash provided by operating activities and debt financing snapon believes that its cash from operations coupled with its sources of borrowings are sufficient to fund its anticipated requirements for working capital capital expenditures restructuring activities acquisitions common stock repurchases and dividend payments due to snapon’s credit rating over the years external funds have been available at a reasonable cost as of the close of business on february 15 2008 snapon’s longterm debt and commercial paper was rated a3 and p2 by moody’s investors service and a and a2 by standard  poor’s snapon believes that the strength of its balance sheet combined with its cash flows from operating activities affords the company the financial flexibility to respond to both internal growth opportunities and those available through acquisitions

inventories of 3224 million at yearend 2007 were essentially flat with yearend 2006 levels as a 153 million net decrease in inventories was largely offset by 147 million of currency translation lower yearoveryear inventory levels from the wind down of a 2006 oem facilitation program in europe essential equipment and diagnostics deployments for major oems and reduced us supply chain inventory were partially offset by higher inventory levels to better meet increased demand for industrial products and professional tools and equipment in europe inventories accounted for using the firstin firstout “fifo” method as of december 29 2007 and december 30 2006 approximated 65 and 62 respectively of total inventories all other inventories are accounted for using the lifo cost method the company’s lifo reserve decreased from 867 million at december 30 2006 to 750 million at december 29 2007 inventory turns full year cost of goods sold divided by the average of the beginning and ending inventory balances for the year were 49 turns at yearend 2007 as compared to 46 turns at yearend 2006 

  

accounts payable at december 29 2007 was 1716 million down 72 million from yearend 2006 levels primarily due to the timing of payments and the impact of lower inventory levels partially offset by 68 million of currency translation

critical accounting policies 

  

the consolidated financial statements and related notes contain information that is pertinent to management’s discussion and analysis the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period these estimates are generally based on historical experience current conditions and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily available from other sources as well as identifying and assessing our accounting treatment with respect to commitments and contingencies actual results could differ from those estimates snapon considers the following policies to be the most critical in understanding the judgments that are involved in the preparation of the company’s consolidated financial statements and the uncertainties that could impact the company’s financial position results of operations and cash flow

goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets  goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price paid over the value of net tangible and identifiable intangible assets of businesses acquired goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets are not amortized but instead are tested for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that these assets might be impaired impairment tests involve the use of judgmental estimates

  

  

related to the fair market value of the business operations with which goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets are associated taking into consideration both historical operating performance and anticipated financial position and future earnings discounted by the company’s weighted average cost of capital annual impairment tests are performed by the company in the second quarter of each year the 2007 evaluation indicated that no goodwill or intangible asset impairment adjustments were required 

  

should the operations of the businesses with which goodwill or indefinitelived intangible assets are associated incur significant declines in profitability and cash flow in future years due to significant adverse changes in business climate adverse actions by regulators unanticipated competition loss of key personnel andor changes in technology or markets some or all of the recorded goodwill or intangibles could be subject to impairment see note 6 to the consolidated financial statements for further information on goodwill and other intangible assets 

  

allowances for doubtful accounts snapon’s accounts receivable are reported net of estimated bad debt allowances which are regularly evaluated by management for adequacy the evaluations take into consideration various financial and qualitative factors that may affect customers’ ability to pay these factors may include customers’ financial condition collateral debtservicing ability past payment experience and credit bureau information snapon regularly reviews the allowance estimation process and adjusts the allowances as appropriate it is possible however that the accuracy of snapon’s estimation process could be adversely impacted if the financial condition of its customers were to deteriorate the company does not believe that accounts receivable represent significant concentrations of credit risk because of the diversified portfolio of individual customers and geographical areas

  

inventory valuation snapon values its inventory at the lower of cost or market and adjusts for the value of inventory that is estimated to be excess obsolete or otherwise unmarketable inventory adjustments for raw materials are largely based on analysis of raw material age and actual physical inspection of raw material for fitness for use as part of evaluating workinprogress and finished goods management reviews individual product stockkeeping units skus by product category and product life cycle cost adjustments for each product categoryproduct lifecycle state are generally established and maintained based on a combination of historical experience forecasted sales and promotions technological obsolescence inventory age and other actual known conditions and circumstances should actual product marketability and raw material fitness for use be affected by conditions that are different from management estimates further adjustments to inventory allowances may be required

  

internaluse software   in accordance with sop 981 “accounting for the costs of computer software developed or obtained for internal use” costs that are incurred internally in creating software solutions and enhancements to those solutions are expensed until technological feasibility has been established

  

warranty accruals snapon provides product warranties for specific product lines and accrues for estimated future warranty costs in the period in which the sale is recorded snapon calculates its accrual requirements based on historic warranty loss experience that is periodically adjusted for recent actual experience including the timing of claims during the warranty period and actual costs incurred if actual return rates andor repair and replacement costs differ significantly from our estimates adjustments to cost of sales may be required in future periods see note 15 to the consolidated financial statements for further information on snapon’s warranty accrual

  

pension benefits the calculation of snapon’s pension expense and projected benefit obligation requires the use of a number of assumptions changes in these assumptions are primarily influenced by factors outside of snapon’s control and can have a significant effect on the amounts reported in the financial statements snapon believes that the two most critical assumptions are i the expected return on plan assets and ii the assumed discount rate 

  

pension expense increases as the expected rate of return on plan assets decreases lowering the expected rate of return assumption for snapon’s domestic pension plan assets by 05 would have increased snapon’s 2007 domestic pension expense by approximately 34 million at yearend 2007 snapon’s domestic plan assets comprised approximately 87 of snapon’s worldwide pension plan assets see note 11 to the consolidated financial statements for further information on snapon’s pension plans 

  

  

the objective of snapon’s discount rate assumption is to reflect the rate at which the pension benefits could be effectively settled in making this determination the company takes into account the timing and amount of benefits that would be available under the plans the methodology for selecting the discount rate as of yearend 2007 was to match the plan’s cash flows to that of a yield curve that provides the equivalent yields on longterm bonds with an aa rating or better for each maturity the selection of the 65 weightedaverage discount rate for snapon’s domestic pension plans represents the single rate that produces the same present value of cash flows as the estimated benefit plan payments lowering snapon’s domestic discount rate assumption by 05 would have increased snapon’s 2007 domestic pension expense and projected benefit obligation by approximately 25 million and 351 million respectively at yearend 2007 snapon’s domestic projected benefit obligation comprised approximately 81 of snapon’s worldwide projected benefit obligation 

  

income taxes the company records a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized while the company has considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance if these estimates and assumptions change in the future the company may be required to adjust its valuation allowance this could result in a charge to or an increase in income in the period such determination is made 

  

in addition the company operates within multiple taxing jurisdictions and is subject to audit in these jurisdictions the company records accruals for the estimated outcomes of these audits and the accruals may change in the future due to new developments in each matter 

  

stockbased compensation effective january 1 2006 the company adopted sfas no 123r “sharebased payment” using the modified prospective method sfas no 123r requires entities to recognize the cost of employee services in exchange for awards of equity instruments based on the grantdate fair value of those awards with limited exceptions that cost based on the estimated number of awards that are expected to vest will be recognized over the period during which the employee is required to provide the service in exchange for the award no compensation cost is recognized for awards for which employees do not render the requisite service upon adoption the grantdate fair value of employee share options and similar instruments was estimated using the blackscholes valuation model 

  

the blackscholes valuation model requires the input of subjective assumptions including the expected life of the stockbased award and stock price volatility the assumptions used are management’s best estimates but the estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management judgment as a result if other assumptions had been used the recorded and pro forma stockbased compensation expense could have been materially different from that depicted in the financial statements 

  

outlook 

  

snapon expects to continue investing in its growth initiatives aimed at expanding value provided to its traditional customers penetrating new and adjacent segments and extending its presence in the emerging markets of asiapacific and eastern europe in addition snapon also expects to continue implementing its strategic growth rci and lowcost sourcing initiatives intended to provide higher levels of growth and profitability snapon anticipates 2008 restructuring costs to be in a range of 15 million to 20 million down from the 26 million incurred in 2007 capital expenditures in 2008 are expected to be in a range of 55 million to 60 million snapon also expects that its 2008 effective income tax rate on earnings before minority interests and equity earnings loss will approximate 33 as a result snapon expects fullyear 2008 sales and operating earnings to improve over 2007 levels

snapon has significant international operations and is subject to certain risks inherent with foreign operations that include currency fluctuations and restrictions on movement of funds foreign exchange risk exists to the extent that snapon has payment obligations or receipts denominated in currencies other than the functional currency to manage these exposures snapon identifies naturally offsetting positions and then generally purchases hedging instruments to protect the residual net anticipated exposures snapon’s financial position and results of operations have not been materially affected by such events to date see note 10 to the consolidated financial statements for further information on foreign currency risk management 

  

interest rate risk management 

  

snapon’s interest rate risk management policies are designed to reduce the potential earnings volatility that could arise from changes in interest rates through the use of interest rate swaps snapon aims to stabilize funding costs by managing the exposure created by the differing maturities and interest rate structures of snapon’s assets and liabilities see note 10 to the consolidated financial statements for further information on interest rate risk management 

  

snapon utilizes a valueatrisk “var” model to determine the potential oneday loss in the fair value of its interest rate and foreign exchangesensitive financial instruments from adverse changes in market factors the var model estimates were made assuming normal market conditions and a 95 confidence level snapon’s computations are based on the interrelationships among movements in various currencies and interest rates variancecovariance technique these interrelationships were determined by observing interest rate and foreign currency market changes over the preceding quarter 

  

the estimated maximum potential oneday loss in fair value calculated using the var model at december 29 2007 was 05 million on interest ratesensitive financial instruments and 03 million on foreign currencysensitive financial instruments the var model is a risk management tool and does not purport to represent actual losses in fair value that will be incurred by snapon nor does it consider the potential effect of favorable changes in market factors 

  

  

credit risk 

  

credit risk is the possibility of loss from a customer’s failure to make payments according to contract terms prior to granting credit each customer is evaluated taking into consideration the borrower’s financial condition collateral debtservicing ability past payment experience credit bureau information and other financial and qualitative factors that may affect the borrower’s ability to repay specific credit reviews and standard industry credit scoring models are used in performing this evaluation loans that have been granted are typically monitored through an assetqualityreview process that closely monitors past due accounts and initiates collection actions when appropriate in addition to its direct credit risk exposure snapon also has credit risk exposure for certain soc loan originations with recourse provisions against snapon primarily for franchisee van loans at december 29 2007 161 million of loans originated by soc have a recourse provision to snapon if the loans become more than 90 days past due for additional information on soc refer to the section entitled “consolidated joint venture” in this management’s discussion and analysis and note 1 to the consolidated financial statements 

  

commodity risk 

  

the company is a purchaser of certain commodities such as steel natural gas and electricity the company is also a purchaser of components and parts that are integrated into the company’s end products as well as the purchaser of certain finished goods all of which may contain various commodities including steel aluminum and others snapon’s supply of raw materials and purchased components are generally and readily available from numerous suppliers 

  

the principal raw material used in the manufacture of our products is steel which we purchase in competitive pricesensitive markets to meet snapon’s high quality standards our steel needs range from specialized alloys which are available only from a limited group of approved suppliers to commodity types of alloys these raw materials have historically exhibited price and demand cyclicality some of these materials have been and in the future may be in short supply as some steel alloys require specialized manufacturing procedures we could experience inventory shortages if we were required to use an alternative manufacturer on short notice additionally unexpected price increases could result in higher prices to our customers or an erosion of the margins on our products 

  

we believe our ability to sell our products is also dependent on the number of vehicles on the road the number of miles driven and the general aging of vehicles these factors affect the frequency type and amount of service and repair performed on vehicles by technicians and therefore affect the demand for the number of technicians the prosperity of the technicians and subsequently the demand the technicians have for our tools other products and services and the value they place on those products and services to the extent that gasoline prices increase consumers may turn to other nongasoline based methods of transportation including more frequent use of public transportation a decrease in the use of gasoline consuming vehicles may lead to fewer repairs and less demand for our products 

  

to the extent that commodity prices increase and the company does not have firm pricing agreements with its suppliers the company may experience margin declines to the extent that it is not able to increase the selling prices of its products

our management including the chief executive officer and chief financial officer does not expect that our internal control over financial reporting will prevent all error or fraud because of inherent limitations a system of internal control over financial reporting can provide only reasonable assurance and may not prevent or detect misstatements further because of changes in conditions effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting may vary over time 

  

  

report of independent registered public accounting firm

snapon incorporated 

  

we have audited the internal control over financial reporting of snapon incorporated and subsidiaries the “company” as of december 29 2007 based on criteria established in internal control – integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission the company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying management’s report on internal control over financial reporting our responsibility is to express an opinion on the company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit 

  

we conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board united states those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting assessing the risk that a material weakness exists testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances we believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinions 

  

a company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by or under the supervision of the company’s principal executive and principal financial officers or persons performing similar functions and effected by the company’s board of directors management and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles a company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 1 pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company 2 provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company and 3 provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements 

  

because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis also projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate 

  

in our opinion the company maintained in all material respects effective internal control over financial reporting as of december 29 2007 based on the criteria established in internal control — integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission

franchise fee revenue including nominal nonrefundable initial and ongoing monthly fees primarily for sales and business training and marketing and product promotion programs is recognized as the fees are earned 

sales and distribution 

snapon markets and distributes its products and related services principally to professional tool and equipment users around the world the two largest market sectors are the vehicle service and repair sector and the industrial sector 

vehicle service and repair sector 

the vehicle service and repair sector has three main customer groups professional technicians who purchase tools and equipment for themselves vehicle service and repair shop owners and managers  including independent shops national chains and automotive dealerships  who purchase equipment for use by multiple technicians within a service or repair facility and vehicle manufacturers 

snapon provides innovative tool equipment solutions and business solutions as well as technical sales support and training to meet technicians’ evolving needs snapon’s franchise van distribution system offers technicians the convenience of purchasing quality tools with minimal disruption of their work routine snapon also provides owners and managers of shops where technicians work with tools diagnostics equipment repair and service information including electronic parts catalogs and shop management products through its equipment solutions business snapon provides oems with products and services including tools consulting services and facilitation services snapon’s facilitation services include product procurement distribution and administrative support to customers for their dealership equipment programs 

major challenges for snapon and the vehicle service and repair sector include the increasing rate of technological change within motor vehicles vehicle population growth vehicle life and the resulting impact on the businesses of both our suppliers and customers that is necessitated by such change snapon believes it is a meaningful participant in the market sector for vehicle service and repair 

industrial sector 

snapon markets its products to a wide variety of industrial customers including industrial maintenance and repair operations manufacturing and assembly facilities various government agencies and facilities schools and oems that require instrumentation or service tools and equipment for their products 

major challenges in the industrial sector include a highly competitive costconscious environment and a trend toward customers making many of their tool purchases through one integrated supplier snapon believes it is a meaningful participant in the market sector for industrial tools and equipment 

distribution channels 

snapon serves customers primarily through the following channels of distribution the mobile franchise van channel company direct sales distributors and ecommerce the following discussion summarizes snapon’s general approach for each channel and is not intended to be allinclusive 

franchisees 

in the united states the majority of sales to the vehicle service and repair sector are conducted through snapon’s franchisees snapon’s franchisees primarily serve vehicle service technicians and vehicle service shop owners generally providing weekly contact at the customer’s place of business franchisees’ sales are concentrated in hand and power tools tool storage units and small diagnostic and shop equipment which can easily be transported in a van and demonstrated during a brief sales call franchisees purchase snapon’s products at a discount from suggested list prices and resell them at prices established by the franchisee although some franchisees have sales areas defined by other methods most us franchisees are provided a list of places of business that serves as the basis of the franchisee’s sales route 

since 1991 new us franchisees and a majority of the pre1991 us franchisees have been enrolled as franchisees of snapon snapon began offering in 2001 a trial franchise option to potential us franchisees that do not meet the franchise qualification requirements trial franchisees typically have less upfront investment and are provided an initial base level of consigned inventory from snapon to assist them in gaining experience and building equity toward the future purchase of a standard franchise snapon also provides certain franchisees the opportunity to add vans to their franchise or to add a limited number of franchises snapon charges nominal initial and ongoing monthly license fees at 2006 year end 3308 us franchisees approximately 95 were enrolled as franchisees or employed by franchisees as compared with 3498 us franchisees approximately 95 at yearend 2005 through soc financing is available to franchisees which includes van and truck leases working capital loans and loans to enable new franchisees to fund the purchase of the franchise while snapon offers financing to qualified 

franchisees and their customers through soc and its wholly owned international finance subsidiaries the decision to finance through snapon or another financing entity is solely at the election of the customer 

snapon has replicated its us franchise van distribution model in certain other countries including australia canada germany japan the netherlands south africa and the united kingdom in many of these markets as in the united states purchase decisions are generally made or influenced by professional vehicle service technicians and shop owners snapon markets products in certain other countries through its subsidiary snapon tools international llc which sells to foreign distributors under license or contract with snapon internationally snapon offers financing to its franchisees and customer networks through its wholly owned finance subsidiaries 

snapon supports its franchisees with a field organization of regional offices franchise performance support teams diagnostic sales developers “dsds” service centers and distribution centers snapon also provides sales and business training and marketing and product promotion programs as well as customer and franchisee financing programs through soc and its wholly owned international finance operations all of which are designed to strengthen franchisee sales in the united states and canada the national franchise advisory council and the snapon tools canadian franchise advisory council both of which are composed of franchisees that are elected by franchisees assist snapon in identifying and implementing enhancements to the franchise program 

in the united states franchisees work closely with dsds the dsd specialists demonstrate and sell higherpricepoint diagnostics and vehicle service shop management information systems dsds work independently and with franchisees to identify and generate sales leads among vehicle service shop owners and managers dsds are snapon employees who are compensated primarily on the basis of commission a franchisee receives a brokerage fee from certain sales made by the dsds to the franchisee’s customers most products sold through the franchisee and dsds are sold under the snapon  bluepoint and sun brand names 

company direct sales 

in the united states a significant proportion of shop equipment sales under the sun john bean and blackhawk brands and information products under the mitchell1 brand are made by a direct sales force that has responsibility for national accounts as the vehicle service and repair sector consolidates with more business conducted by national chains automotive dealerships and franchised service centers the company believes these larger organizations can be serviced most effectively by sales people who can demonstrate and sell the full line of equipment and diagnostic products and services snapon also sells these products and services directly to oems   john bean and blackhawk brands are sold directly to end customers primarily through sales leads generated from franchisees and dsds 

snapon brand tools and equipment are marketed to industrial and governmental customers in the united states through both industrial sales representatives who are employees and independent industrial distributors in most markets outside the united states industrial sales are conducted through independent distributors the sales representatives focus on industrial customers whose main purchase criteria are quality and service at the end of 2006 snapon had industrial sales representatives in the united states australia canada japan mexico puerto rico and some european countries with the united states representing the majority of snapon’s total industrial sales 

business solutions sells automotive and power equipment products both domestically and internationally through an internal sales force products and services are marketed to two targeted groups oems and individual dealerships to effectively reach the large oems such as general motors corporation daimlerchrysler ag ford motor company and toyota motor corporation business solutions has deployed a team of business development professionals in the world’s principal automotive centers in the united states the united kingdom germany and japan in the united states and canada automotive and power equipment products and services are sold directly to individual dealerships using an experienced sales force 

distributors 

sales of certain tools and equipment are made through independent vehicle service and industrial distributors who purchase the items from snapon and resell them to the end users hand tools under the bahco fish and hook design  pradines and lindstrom brands and trade names for example are sold through distributors in europe north and south america asia and certain other parts of the world wheel 

service and other vehicle service equipment are sold through distributors primarily under brands including hofmann and kansas jack  hand tools under the irimo palmera and acesa brands and power tools under the sioux brand are differentiated from those products sold through the franchisee dsd and direct sales channels sun branded equipment is marketed through distributors in south america and asia  and through both a direct sales force and distributors in europe 

ecommerce

snapon’s supply of raw materials and purchased components are generally and readily available from numerous suppliers during 2005 and 2006 snapon experienced higher pricing related to certain grades and alloys of steel snapon has secured an ample supply of both bar and coil steel for the near future to ensure stable supply to meet material demands while snapon believes that steel prices will continue to remain high for 2007 the company does not anticipate experiencing any significant pricing or availability issues with regards to 2007 steel purchases 

patents trademarks and other intellectual property 

snapon vigorously pursues and relies on patent protection to protect its intellectual property and its position in its markets as of december 30 2006 snapon and its subsidiaries held over 700 active and pending patents in the united 

states and over 1600 active and pending patents outside of the united states sales relating to any single patent did not represent a material portion of snapon’s revenues in the last three years 

examples of products that have features or designs that benefit from patent protection include wheel alignment systems wheel balancers sealed ratchets electronic torque instruments ratcheting screwdrivers emissionssensing devices and diagnostic equipment 

much of the technology used in the manufacture of vehicle service tools and equipment is in the public domain snapon relies primarily on trade secret protection to protect proprietary processes used in manufacturing methods and processes are patented when appropriate copyright protection is also utilized when appropriate 

trademarks used by snapon are of continuing importance to snapon in the marketplace trademarks have been registered in the united states and more than 100 other countries and additional applications for trademark registrations are pending snapon vigorously polices proper use of its trademarks snapon’s right to manufacture and sell certain products is dependent upon licenses from others however these products under license do not represent a material portion of snapon’s net sales 

domain names have become a valuable corporate asset for companies around the world including snapon domain names often contain a trademark or service mark or even a corporate name and are often considered intellectual property the recognition and value of the snapon name trademark and domain name are core strengths of the company snapon monitors new developments in toplevel domains and countrycode domains in order to preserve snapon’s right to relevant domain names 

snapon is selectively and strategically licensing the snapon brand to carefully selected manufacturing and distribution companies including apparel work boots and a variety of other goods in order to further build equity and market presence for the company’s strongest brand 

environment 

snapon is subject to various environmental laws ordinances regulations and other requirements of government authorities in the united states and other nations at snapon these environmental liabilities are managed through the snapon environmental hygiene and safety management system “eh  sms” which is applied worldwide the system is based upon continual improvement and is certified to iso 140011996 and ohsas 180011999 verified through det norske veritas dnv certification inc 

snapon believes that it complies with applicable environmental control requirements in its operations expenditures on environmental matters through eh  sms have not had and snapon does not for the foreseeable future expect them to have a material effect upon snapon’s capital expenditures earnings or competitive position 

employees 

at the end of january 2007 snapon employed approximately 12400 people compared to approximately 11400 people at the end of january 2006 the yearoveryear increase in employees primarily reflects the 2006 acquisition of proquest business solutions partially offset by the impact of restructuringrelated and management realignment actions at various snapon facilities 

approximately 3200 employees or 26 of snapon’s worldwide workforce are represented by unions andor covered under collective bargaining agreements approximately 1560 employees are covered under agreements expiring in 2007 in recent years snapon has not experienced any significant work slowdowns stoppages or other labor disruptions 

the number of covered union employees whose contracts expire within the next five years is approximately 1560 in 2007 1630 in 2008 20 in 2009 and zero in both 2010 and 2011 

there can be no assurance that future contracts with snapon’s unions will be renegotiated upon terms acceptable to snapon 

working capital 

as most of snapon’s business is not seasonal and its inventory needs are relatively constant no unusual working capital needs arise during the year snapon does not have a significant backlog of orders at december 30 2006 

snapon’s financial condition and use of working capital are discussed in “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” 

neither snapon nor any of its segments except financial services depend on any single customer small group of customers or government for any material part of its revenues as a result of soc’s relationship with cit snapon’s financial services business segment depends on cit for more than 10 of its revenues 




 item 1a risk factors in evaluating the company careful consideration should be given to the following risk factors in addition to the other information included in this annual report on form 10k each of these risk factors could adversely affect the company’s business operating results andor financial condition as well as adversely affect the value of an investment in the company’s common stock in addition to the following disclosures please refer to the other information contained in this report including the consolidated financial statements and the related notes 

the success of snapon’s mobile van tool distribution business depends on the success of its franchisees 

approximately 41 of our 2006 revenues were generated by the snapon tools group which consists of snapon’s business operations serving the worldwide franchise van channel except in limited circumstances each of our mobile tool vans is operated by a franchisee pursuant to a franchise agreement snapon’s success is dependent on its relationships with franchisees individually and collectively as they are the primary sales and service link between the company and vehicle service and repair technicians who are an important class of end users for snapon’s products and services if our franchisees are not successful or if we do not maintain an effective relationship with our franchisees the delivery of products the collection of receivables andor our relationship with end users could be adversely affected and thereby negatively impact our financial results 

in addition if we are unable to maintain effective relationships with franchisees the company or the franchisees may choose to terminate the relationship which may result in i open routes in which enduse customers are not provided reliable service ii litigation resulting from termination andor iii reduced collections or increased writeoffs of franchisee receivables owed to snapon as snapon has over 4800 franchisees worldwide and most of these franchise relationships are governed by contract it is not uncommon for litigation to result from the termination of these relationships 

the steps taken to restructure operations rationalize operating footprint lower operating expenses and achieve greater efficiencies in the supply chain could disrupt business 

we have taken steps in the past and expect to take additional steps in 2007 intended to improve customer service and to drive further efficiencies and reduce costs some of which could be disruptive to our business these actions collectively across our operating groups are focused on the following 

·   continue on the company’s existing path to improve and transform global manufacturing and the supply chain into a marketdemandbased replenishment system with lower costs

·   continue to enhance service and value to snapon’s franchisees and customers

·   continue to invest in initiatives focused on building a strong sales and operating presence in emerging growth markets

·   continue to implement rapid continuous improvement rci activities throughout the organization to drive further efficiencies and reduce costs

·   continue to invest in developing and marketing new innovative highervalueadded products and advanced technologies and

·   extend snapon’s products and services into additional markets or to new customers

specific initiatives in each of these areas are underway snapon believes that by executing on these focus areas along with a continued commitment to new innovative products and rapid continuous improvement to drive lower costs the company and its franchisees will realize stronger growth and profitability however 

failure to succeed in the implementation of any or all of these actions could result in our being unable to achieve our financial goals and could be disruptive to the business 

in addition reductions to headcount and other cost reduction measures may result in the loss of technical expertise that could adversely affect our research and development efforts and ability to meet product development schedules efforts to reduce components of expense could result in the recording of charges for inventory and technologyrelated writeoffs workforce reduction costs or other charges relating to the consolidation of facilities if we were to incur a substantial charge to further these efforts our earnings or loss per share would be adversely affected in such period if we are unable to effectively manage our cost reduction and restructuring efforts our business results of operations and financial condition could be harmed 

risks associated with the integration of snapon’s acquisition of proquest business solutions or other future acquisitions could have an adverse impact on snapon’s results of operations and financial position 

we completed the acquisition of proquest business solutions on november 28 2006 if our integration of this business is not successful it could adversely affect our earnings cash flow and share price the acquisition also involves risks and uncertainties that include 

·   retaining the customers of business solutions and achieving the expected benefits of the acquisition including i accelerating earnings and cash flows ii expanding our existing product offerings into the global automotive oem dealership segment and iii creating new customer relationships and product integration opportunities

·   losing key employees of business solutions

·   incurring additional debt earnings dilution and contingent liabilities

·   implementing and maintaining consistent standards controls procedures policies and information systems and

·   diverting management’s attention from other business concerns

proquest company the predecessor parent company of proquest business solutions is the subject of an ongoing accounting review by the sec proquest company has announced that this review will result in the restatement of previously reported earnings when it files its 2005 annual report on form 10k with the sec in connection with snapon’s acquisition of the proquest business solutions segment proquest company prepared financial statements of proquest business solutions on a standalone basis as of and for the year ended december 31 2005 proquest company’s independent auditors audited those financial statements and snapon filed those audited financial statements with the sec in a current report on form 8ka dated january 9 2007 which amended the company’s current report on form 8k dated november 28 2006 because proquest company’s restated financial statements are not yet finalized and the proquest company sec investigation is ongoing we cannot assure that when proquest company files its restated results they will not contain additional information that could impact the proquest business solutions’ audited standalone financial statements snapon will evaluate any new information and if it is material the information could result in the company’s need to amend its form 8ka filing to restate the proquest business solutions’ financial statements 

information technology infrastructure is critical to supporting business objectives 

we depend heavily on information technology infrastructure to achieve our business objectives if a problem occurs that impairs this infrastructure the resulting disruption could impede our ability to record or process orders manufacture and ship in a timely manner or otherwise carry on business in the normal course any such events could cause us to lose customers or revenue and could require us to incur significant expense to remediate 

in association with initiatives to better integrate business units rationalize operating footprint and improve responsiveness to franchisees and customers snapon is replacing and enhancing its existing global enterprise resource planning erp management information system the integration implementation and deployment of new information technology processes and a common information infrastructure which began in 2006 is expected to cover a period of several years we could experience disruptions in our business as we implement the system enhancements including the possibility that the new system may not perform as expected which could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

the recognition of impairment charges on goodwill would adversely impact future financial position and results of operations 

we are required to perform impairment tests on our goodwill balance annually or at any time when events occur which could impact the value of our business segments our determination of whether impairment has occurred is based on a comparison of each of our reporting units’ fair market value with its carrying value significant and unanticipated changes could require a provision for impairment in a future period that could substantially affect our reported earnings and reduce our consolidated net worth and shareholders’ equity 

business interruptions for franchisees could adversely impact operating results 

franchisees have historically experienced business interruptions due to adverse weather conditions or other extraordinary events such as hurricanes in the southern united states and wild fires in california to the extent our franchisees experience future similar events our operating results may be adversely impacted 

exposure to credit risks of customers and resellers may make it difficult to collect receivables and could adversely affect operating results and financial condition 

industry and economic conditions have the potential to weaken the financial position of some of our customers if circumstances surrounding our customers’ financial capabilities were to deteriorate such writedowns or writeoffs would negatively affect our operating results for the period in which they occur and if large could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition 

failure to maintain effective distribution of products and services could adversely impact revenue gross margin and profitability 

we use a variety of distribution methods to sell our products and services successfully managing the interaction of our distribution efforts to reach various potential customer segments for our products and services is a complex process moreover since each distribution method has distinct risks and gross margins our failure to implement the most advantageous balance in the delivery model for our products and services could adversely affect our revenue and gross margins and therefore our profitability 

risks associated with the disruption of manufacturing operations could adversely affect profitability or competitive position 

we manufacture a significant portion of the products we sell any prolonged disruption in the operations of our existing manufacturing facilities whether due to technical or labor difficulties lack of raw material or component availability destruction of or damage to any facility including natural disasters use and storage of hazardous materials or other events or other reasons could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

the inability to provide acceptable financing alternatives to enduser customers and franchisees could adversely impact operating results 

an integral component of snapon’s business and profitability is its ability to provide financing alternatives to enduser customers and franchisees which for its domestic financing operations are managed through a joint venture with cit historically cit has been the exclusive purchaser of the credit and installment financing arranged by soc a deterioration of the relationship between the joint venture partners or if the joint venture should be unexpectedly dissolved could have an adverse impact on snapon’s results of operations and ability to provide financing to enduser customers and franchisees in the united states adverse fluctuations in interest rates andor the ability to provide competitive financing programs could also have an adverse impact on snapon’s revenue and profitability 

the global tool and equipment industry is competitive 

we face strong competition in all of our market segments price competition in our various industries is intense and pricing pressures from competitors and customers are increasing in general as a manufacturer and marketer of premium products and services the expectations of snapon’s customers and its franchisees are high and increasing any inability to maintain customer satisfaction could diminish snapon’s premium image and reputation and could result in a lessening of its ability to command premium 

pricing we expect that the level of competition will remain high in the future which could limit our ability to maintain or increase market share or profitability 

the inability to continue to introduce new products that respond to customer needs and achieve market acceptance could result in lower revenues and reduced profitability 

sales from new products represent a significant portion of our net sales and are expected to continue to represent a significant component of our future net sales we may not be able to compete effectively unless we continue to enhance existing products or introduce new products to the marketplace in a timely manner product improvements and new product introductions require significant financial and other resources including significant planning design development and testing at the technological product and manufacturing process levels our competitors’ new products may beat our products to market be more effective with more features be less expensive than our products andor render our products obsolete any new products that we develop may not receive market acceptance or otherwise generate any meaningful net sales or profits for us relative to our expectations based on among other things existing and anticipated investments in manufacturing capacity and commitments to fund advertising marketing promotional programs and research and development 

raw material and energy price fluctuations and shortages including steel and various fuel sources could adversely affect the ability to obtain needed manufacturing materials and could adversely affect results of operations 

the principal raw material used in the manufacture of our products is steel which we purchase in competitive pricesensitive markets to meet snapon’s high quality standards our steel needs range from specialized alloys which are available only from a limited group of approved suppliers to commodity types of alloys these raw materials have historically exhibited price and demand cyclicality some of these materials have been and in the future may be in short supply as some steel alloys require specialized manufacturing procedures we could experience inventory shortages if we were required to use an alternative manufacturer on short notice additionally unexpected price increases could result in higher prices to our customers or an erosion of the margins on our products 

we believe our ability to sell our products is also dependent on the number of vehicles on the road the number of miles driven and the general aging of vehicles these factors affect the frequency type and amount of service and repair performed on vehicles by technicians and therefore affect the demand for the number of technicians the prosperity of the technicians and subsequently the demand technicians have for our tools other products and services and the value technicians place on those products and services to the extent that gasoline prices increase consumers may turn to other nongasoline based methods of transportation including more frequent use of public transportation a decrease in the use of gasoline consuming vehicles may lead to fewer repairs and less demand for our products 

foreign operations are subject to currency exchange and political risks that could adversely affect results of operations 

approximately 44 of our revenues in 2006 were generated outside of the united states future growth rates and success of our business depends in large part on continued growth in our nonus operations including growth in emerging markets numerous risks and uncertainties affect our nonus operations these risks and uncertainties include political economic and social instability including acts of war civil disturbance or acts of terrorism local labor conditions changes in government policies and regulations including imposition or increases in withholding and other taxes on remittances and other payments by international subsidiaries and enforcement of contract and intellectual property rights we are also affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates inflation rates and interest rates additionally cash generated in nonus jurisdictions may be difficult to transfer to the united states in a taxefficient manner 

failure to adequately protect intellectual property could adversely affect business 

intellectual property rights are an important and integral component of our business we attempt to protect our intellectual property rights through a combination of patent trademark copyright and trade secret laws as well as licensing agreements and thirdparty nondisclosure and assignment agreements adverse determinations in a judicial or administrative proceeding could prevent us from manufacturing and selling our products or prevent us from stopping others from manufacturing and selling competing products failure to obtain or maintain adequate protection of our intellectual property rights for any reason could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

the inability to successfully defend claims from taxing authorities could adversely affect operating results and financial position 

we conduct business in many countries which requires us to interpret the income tax laws and rulings in each of those taxing jurisdictions due to the subjectivity of tax laws between those jurisdictions as well as the subjectivity of factual interpretations our estimates of income tax liabilities may differ from actual payments or assessments claims from taxing authorities related to these differences could have an adverse impact on our operating results and financial position 

failure to attract and retain qualified personnel could lead to a loss of revenue andor profitability 

snapon’s success depends in part on the efforts and abilities of its senior management team and other key employees their skills experience and industry contacts significantly benefit our operations and administration the failure to attract and retain members of our senior management team and other key employees could have a negative effect on our operating results 

failure to achieve expected investment returns on pension plan assets could adversely impact our results of operations financial position and cash flow 

snapon sponsors various pension benefit plans the assets of the pension plan are broadly diversified in an attempt to mitigate the risk of a large loss the assets are invested in equity securities fixed income securities real estate and other real assets and money market instruments required funding for the company’s defined benefit pension plans is determined in accordance with guidelines set forth in the federal employee retirement income security act erisa additional contributions to enhance the funded status of the pension plans can be made at the company’s discretion however there can be no assurance that the value of the pension plan assets or the investment returns on those plan assets will be sufficient to meet the future benefit obligations of such plans in addition during periods of adverse investment market conditions and declining interest rates the company may be required to make additional cash contributions to the plans that would reduce our financial flexibility see note 12 to the consolidated financial statements for further information on the company’s pension benefit plans 

our defined benefit pension plan obligations are affected by changes in market interest rates significant fluctuations in market interest rates will add volatility to our pension plan obligations declining market interest rates will increase our pension plan obligations while our plan assets are broadly diversified there is inherent market risks associated with investments if adverse market conditions develop our plan assets could incur a loss the combination of declining market interest rates and plan asset investment losses may adversely impact our financial position and results of operations 

the company’s defined benefit pension expense is calculated by netting five factors service cost interest on projected benefit obligations the expected return on plan assets the amortization of prior service costs and the effects of actuarial gains and losses the accounting for pensions involves the estimation of a number of factors that are highly uncertain certain factors such as the interest cost and the expected return on plan assets are impacted by changes in market interest rates and the value of plan assets a significant decrease in market interest rates and a decrease in the fair value of plan assets would increase net pension expense and may adversely affect the company’s future results of operations

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

management overview 

snapon continued implementing its strategic initiatives in 2006 to create longterm value for the company’s shareholders associates franchisees and other distributor partners across all of its business segments 

during 2006 measurable progress was realized net sales grew 71 year over year driven largely by growth in the diagnostics  information group’s equipment solutions business which provides essential diagnostics and equipment to original equipment manufacturers “oems” and their dealerships as well as growth in emerging markets in the commercial  industrial group operating earnings of 1649 million in 2006 decreased 31 million from 2005 levels largely due to a 380 million pretax franchisee litigation settlement charge recorded in the snapon tools group snapon has not admitted any wrongdoing by way of this settlement see note 16 to the consolidated financial statements for information on the litigation settlement 

on november 28 2006 snapon acquired the proquest business solutions business and certain net assets hereinafter referred to as “proquest business solutions” or “business solutions” from proquest company for a preliminary purchase price of approximately 516 million including 8 million of estimated transaction costs and the assumption of approximately 19 million of debt the acquisition of proquest business solutions a world leader in automotive parts and service information expanded the company’s diagnostics  information group’s product offerings business solutions’ products which are aimed at helping oems and their dealerships enhance their service operations include integrated software services and systems that transform complex technical data for parts catalogs into easily accessed electronic information in the form of electronic parts catalogs other business solutions’ products and services include warranty and management systems and analytics to help dealerships manage and track performance over 33000 automotive dealerships worldwide use business solutions’ electronic parts catalogs which are available in 26 different languages and support 15 automotive manufacturers and 31 brands business solutions’ products are also sold to over 85000 dealers in the power equipment and power sports markets snapon believes that the strategic acquisition of proquest business solutions positions the company to add value for global oems and enhance the productivity and profitability of oem dealerships while affording growth opportunities for snapon’s other customers associates and shareholders 

while progress in 2006 has been encouraging the company believes there is still much more to be done to improve operating performance and profitability the strategic priorities and plans for 2007 will continue to build on the improvement initiatives already underway to achieve longterm profitable growth through increased sales and further lowering of costs 

in the snapon tools group  considerable progress was made in strengthening its operating and financial performance strategic priorities in 2006 focused on efforts to enhance snapon’s responsiveness to its franchisees and customers and to strengthen the financial and operating performance of both the franchisees and the company 

through improvements in the company’s supply chain and the transition to a marketdemand based replenishment system snapon’s complete and ontime delivery rate for the top 88 of demanded stock keeping units “skus” improved to 93 in 2006 with a goal to achieve a 99 complete and ontime delivery rate on all skus by the end of 2007 the snapon tools group also completed the transformation of its field support system to a “teambased” organization in 2006 which is designed to provide more specialized and focused support to its franchisees the company also implemented “pull marketing” efforts such as increased media advertising van merchandising and online web site and enews to generate product excitement and drive increased traffic to the franchisee van in addition the snapon tools group also revamped its warehouse distribution program and launched a new midtier product line aimed at capturing additional customers and capitalizing on more purchase occasions 

segment net sales in the snapon tools group in 2006 were up 31 over 2005 levels primarily due to a significant fourthquarter sales increase in the united states combined with continued growth in international sales despite the sales increase and savings realized from rapid continuous improvement “rci” activities operating earnings in 2006 of 376 million were negatively impacted by the 380 million pretax franchisee litigation settlement charge discussed above and by 133 million of higher planned costs to support the strategic supply chain and franchise system initiatives 

the snapon tools group 2007 strategic priorities will continue to build on the progress made in enhancing the franchise proposition and improving the supply chain with specific initiatives focused on the following 

·   continue to improve franchisee profitability

·   expand pull marketing initiatives

·   capture additional customers

segment revenues and operating income were 536 million and 157 million in 2005 down 245 million and 184 million from prioryear levels primarily due to the impact of higher yearoveryear interest rates in snapon’s domestic financing business as well as an 114 decline in originations 

corporate

financial condition

snapon has been focused on improving asset utilization by making more effective use of its investment in certain working capital items the company assesses management’s operating performance and effectiveness relative to those components of working capital particularly accounts receivable and inventories which are more directly impacted by operational decisions 

as of december 30 2006 working capital current assets less current liabilities of 4312 million was down 1356 million from 5668 million as of december 31 2005 primarily due to the impacts from the company’s november 28 2006 acquisition of proquest business solutions

cash at the end of 2006 was 634 million down 1070 million from yearend 2005 levels the decrease in cash from 2005 levels is the result of disbursing approximately 203 million of available cash on hand to fund in part the acquisition of proquest business solutions see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for information on the proquest business solutions acquisition 

accounts receivable at the end of 2006 was 5592 million up 733 million from yearend 2005 levels including 350 million from the 2006 business solutions acquisition and 210 million of currency translation the yearoveryear increase in accounts receivable also reflects the impact of higher sales in the fourth quarter of 2006 largely driven by increased sales in the diagnostic  information group’s equipment solutions business days sales outstanding at yearend 2006 was 76 days as compared with 74 days at yearend 2005 

inventories totaled 3230 million at the end of 2006 up 398 million from yearend 2005 levels including 153 million from currency translation the yearoveryear increase in inventories primarily reflects the impacts of the company’s decision to maintain higher inventory levels to better meet customer demand as it proceeds with implementing its strategic supply chain and other initiatives and increased inventory associated with essential equipment and diagnostics deployments for major oems inventories accounted for using the firstin firstout “fifo” method as of december 30 2006 and december 31 2005 approximated 62 and 63 of total inventories all other inventories are accounted for using the lifo cost method the company’s lifo reserve increased from 821 million at december 31 2005 to 867 million at december 30 2006 inventory turns full year cost of goods sold divided by the average of the beginning and ending inventory balances for the year at december 30 2006 were 46 turns as compared to 41 turns at yearend 2005

depreciation in 2006 was 485 million compared with 495 million in 2005 and 585 million in 2004 the decline in depreciation from 2004 levels reflects the absence of depreciation for both the company’s northamerican based erp system which became fully depreciated midyear 2004 and two us handtool facilities that were closed in 2004 amortization expense was 34 million in 2006 27 million in 2005 and 25 million in 2004

new accounting standards 

see note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for information on new accounting standards 

critical accounting policies 

the consolidated financial statements and related notes contain information that is pertinent to management’s discussion and analysis the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period these estimates are generally based on historical experience current conditions and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily available from other sources as well as identifying and assessing our accounting treatment with respect to commitments and contingencies actual results could differ from those estimates snapon considers the following policies to be the most critical in understanding the judgments that are involved in the preparation of the company’s consolidated financial statements and the uncertainties that could impact the company’s financial position results of operations and cash flow 

  

revenue recognition snapon derives revenue primarily from the sale of tools diagnostics and equipment solutions for professional tool and equipment users snapon markets its products and services through the worldwide franchise mobile van channel company direct sales and independent distributor and other nonfranchise channels including its public internet web site snapon also derives revenue from various financing programs to facilitate the sales of its products

  

snapon recognizes revenue from the sale of tools diagnostics and equipment solutions when all of the following conditions are satisfied i persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists ii the price is fixed or determinable iii collectibility is reasonably assured and iv delivery has occurred or services have been rendered delivery generally occurs when the title and the risks and rewards of ownership have substantially transferred to the customer for sales contingent upon customer acceptance or product installation revenue recognition is deferred until such obligations are fulfilled as required by sfas no 48 “ revenue recognition when right of return exists” estimated product returns are recorded as a reduction in reported revenues at the time of sale based upon historical product return experience and assumptions for the gross profit margin and volume of future sales returns provisions for customer volume rebates discounts and allowances are also recorded as a reduction of reported revenues at the time of sale based on historical experience and known trends revenue related to maintenance and subscription agreements is recognized over the term of the agreement 

  

financial services revenue in addition to its sales of tools diagnostics and equipment solutions snapon also generates revenue from various financing programs that include i loans to franchisees and ii loans to the franchisees’ customer network and to snapon’s industrial and other customers for the purchase of tools and equipment on an extendedterm payment plan these financing programs are offered through soc a consolidated 50owned joint venture with cit and the company’s wholly owned international finance subsidiaries financial services revenue consists of soc’s sales of originated contracts to cit and service fee income as well as installment contract revenue and franchisee loan receivable revenue derived from soc and snapon’s wholly owned international finance operations the decision to finance through snapon or another financing entity is solely at the election of the customer when assessing customers for potential financing snapon considers various factors regarding ability to pay including financial condition collateral debtservicing ability past payment experience and credit bureau information contracts originated by soc and subsequently sold to cit are also subject to the underwriting approval of cit 

  

financing revenue from soc is recognized primarily from the sale of originated contracts to cit net of various fees including securitization warehousing bad debt and prepayment fees soc continues to service these contracts for an estimated marketrate servicing fee servicing fees are paid to soc by cit and such revenue is recognized over the contractual term of the loan with a portion of the servicing fee recognized at the time of origination financing revenue from originated loans that are retained is recognized over the life of the contract with interest computed on a daily basis 

  

snapon’s wholly owned international finance subsidiaries own all of the loans originated through their financing programs revenue from interest income is recognized over the life of the contract with interest computed on a daily basis 

  

franchise fee revenue including nominal nonrefundable initial and ongoing monthly fees primarily for sales and business training and marketing and product promotion programs is recognized as the fees are earned 

  

allowances for doubtful accounts snapon’s accounts receivable are reported net of estimated bad debt allowances which are regularly evaluated by management for adequacy the evaluations take into consideration various financial and qualitative factors that may affect customers’ ability to pay these factors may include customers’ financial condition collateral debtservicing ability past payment experience and credit bureau information snapon regularly reviews the allowance estimation process and adjusts the allowances as appropriate it is possible however that the accuracy of snapon’s estimation process could be adversely impacted if the financial condition of its customers were to deteriorate the company does not believe that accounts receivable represent significant concentrations of credit risk because of the diversified portfolio of individual customers and geographical areas

inventory valuation snapon values its inventory at the lower of cost or market and adjusts for the value of inventory that is estimated to be excess obsolete or otherwise unmarketable inventory adjustments for raw materials are largely based on analysis of raw material age and actual physical inspection of raw material for fitness for use as part of evaluating workinprogress and finished goods management reviews individual product skus by product category and product life cycle cost adjustments for each product categoryproduct lifecycle state are generally established and maintained based on a combination of historical experience forecasted sales and promotions technological obsolescence inventory age and other actual known conditions and circumstances should actual product marketability and raw material fitness for use be affected by conditions that are different from management estimates further adjustments to inventory allowances may be required

warranty accruals snapon provides product warranties for specific product lines and accrues for estimated future warranty costs in the period in which the sale is recorded snapon calculates its accrual requirements based on historic warranty loss experience that is periodically adjusted for recent actual experience including the timing of claims during the warranty period and actual costs incurred see note 16 to the consolidated financial statements for further information on snapon’s warranty accrual

pension benefits the calculation of snapon’s pension expense and projected benefit obligation requires the use of a number of assumptions changes in these assumptions are primarily influenced by factors outside of snapon’s control and can have a significant effect on the amounts reported in the financial statements snapon believes that the two most critical assumptions are the expected return on plan assets and the assumed discount rate 

pension expense increases as the expected rate of return on plan assets decreases lowering the expected rate of return assumption for snapon’s domestic pension plan assets by 05 would increase snapon’s 2006 domestic pension expense by approximately 33 million at yearend 2006 snapon’s domestic plan assets comprised approximately 88 of snapon’s worldwide pension plan assets see note 12 to the consolidated financial statements for further information on snapon’s pension plans 

snapon establishes the discount rate using the current rates earned on longterm bonds with a moody’s aa rating pension expense and projected benefit obligation both increase as the discount rate is reduced lowering snapon’s domestic discount rate assumption by 05 would increase snapon’s 2006 domestic pension expense and projected benefit obligation by approximately 38 million and 408 million respectively at yearend 2006 snapon’s domestic projected benefit obligation comprised approximately 82 of snapon’s worldwide projected benefit obligation 

income taxes the company records a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized while the company has considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance if these estimates and assumptions change in the future the company may be required to adjust its valuation allowance this could result in a charge to or an increase in income in the period such determination is made 

in addition the company operates within multiple taxing jurisdictions and is subject to audit in these jurisdictions the company records accruals for the estimated outcomes of these audits and the accruals may change in the future due to new developments in each matter 

stockbased compensation effective january 1 2006 the company adopted sfas no 123r “ sharebased payment ” using the modified prospective method sfas no 123r requires entities to recognize the cost of employee services in exchange for awards of equity instruments based on the grantdate fair value of those awards with limited exceptions that cost based on the estimated number of awards that are expected to vest will be recognized over the period during which the employee is required to provide the service in exchange for the award no compensation cost is recognized for awards for which employees do

  

not render the requisite service upon adoption the grantdate fair value of employee share options and similar instruments was estimated using the blackscholes valuation model 

  

the blackscholes valuation model requires the input of highly subjective assumptions including the expected life of the stockbased award and stock price volatility the assumptions used are management’s best estimates but the estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management judgment as a result if other assumptions had been used the recorded and pro forma stockbased compensation expense could have been materially different from that depicted in the financial statements

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

market credit and economic risks 

market risk is the potential economic loss that may result from adverse changes in the fair value of financial instruments snapon is exposed to market risk from changes in both foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates snapon monitors its exposure to these risks and attempts to manage the underlying economic exposures through the use of financial instruments such as forward exchange contracts and interest rate swap agreements snapon does not use derivative instruments for speculative or trading purposes snapon’s broadbased business activities help to reduce the impact that volatility in any particular area or related areas may have on its operating earnings as a whole snapon’s management takes an active role in the risk management process and has developed policies and procedures that require specific administrative and business functions to assist in the identification assessment and control of various risks foreign currency risk management 

snapon has significant international operations and is subject to certain risks inherent with foreign operations that include currency fluctuations and restrictions on movement of funds foreign exchange risk exists to the extent that snapon has payment obligations or receipts denominated in currencies other than the functional currency to manage these exposures snapon identifies naturally offsetting positions and then generally purchases hedging instruments to protect the residual net anticipated exposures snapon’s financial position and results of operations have not been materially affected by such events to date see note 11 to the consolidated financial statements for further information on foreign currency risk management 

interest rate risk management 

snapon’s interest rate risk management policies are designed to reduce the potential earnings volatility that could arise from changes in interest rates through the use of interest rate swaps snapon aims to stabilize funding costs by managing the exposure created by the differing maturities and interest rate structures of snapon’s assets and liabilities see note 11 to the consolidated financial statements for further information on interest rate risk management 

snapon utilizes a valueatrisk “var” model to determine the potential oneday loss in the fair value of its interest rate and foreign exchangesensitive financial instruments from adverse changes in market factors the var model estimates were made assuming normal market conditions and a 95 confidence level snapon’s computations are based on the interrelationships among movements in various currencies and interest rates variancecovariance technique these interrelationships were determined by observing interest rate and foreign currency market changes over the preceding quarter 

the estimated maximum potential oneday loss in fair value calculated using the var model at december 30 2006 was 03 million on interest ratesensitive financial instruments and 02 million on foreign currencysensitive financial instruments the var model is a risk management tool and does not purport to represent actual losses in fair value that will be incurred by snapon nor does it consider the potential effect of favorable changes in market factors

credit risk is the possibility of loss from a customer’s failure to make payments according to contract terms prior to granting credit each customer is evaluated taking into consideration the borrower’s financial condition collateral debtservicing ability past payment experience credit bureau information and other financial and qualitative factors that may affect the borrower’s ability to repay specific credit reviews and standard industry credit scoring models are used in performing this evaluation loans that have been granted are typically monitored through an assetqualityreview process that closely monitors past due accounts and initiates collection actions when appropriate in addition to its direct credit risk exposure snapon also has credit risk exposure for certain soc loan originations with recourse provisions against snapon primarily for franchisee van loans at december 30 2006 162 million of loans originated by soc have a recourse provision to snapon if the loans become more than 90 days past due for additional information on soc refer to the section entitled “consolidated joint venture” in this management’s discussion and analysis and notes 1 and 7 to the consolidated financial statements 

commodity risk 

the company is a purchaser of certain commodities such as steel natural gas and electricity the company is also a purchaser of components and parts that are integrated into the company’s end products as well as the purchaser of certain finished goods all of which may contain various commodities including steel aluminum and others snapon’s supply of raw materials and purchased components are generally and readily available from numerous suppliers 

the principal raw material used in the manufacture of our products is steel which we purchase in competitive pricesensitive markets to meet snapon’s high quality standards our steel needs range from specialized alloys which are available only from a limited group of approved suppliers to commodity types of alloys these raw materials have historically exhibited price and demand cyclicality some of these materials have been and in the future may be in short supply as some steel alloys require specialized manufacturing procedures we could experience inventory shortages if we were required to use an alternative manufacturer on short notice additionally unexpected price increases could result in higher prices to our customers or an erosion of the margins on our products 

we believe our ability to sell our products is also dependent on the number of vehicles on the road the number of miles driven and the general aging of vehicles these factors affect the frequency type and amount of service and repair performed on vehicles by technicians and therefore affect the demand for the number of technicians the prosperity of the technicians and subsequently the demand the technicians have for our tools other products and services and the value they place on those products and services to the extent that gasoline prices increase consumers may turn to other nongasoline based methods of transportation including more frequent use of public transportation a decrease in the use of gasoline consuming vehicles may lead to fewer repairs and less demand for our products 

to the extent that commodity prices increase and the company does not have firm pricing agreements with its suppliers the company may experience margin declines to the extent that it is not able to increase the selling prices of its products

management’s report on internal control over financial reporting 

  

our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in exchange act rules 13a15f under the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended under the supervision and with the participation of our management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer we evaluated the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the criteria set forth by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission in internal control – integrated framework  as permitted by the public company accounting oversight board auditing standards the company’s november 28 2006 acquisition of proquest business solutions which represented 237 of total assets at december 30 2006 and less than 1 of 2006 net sales was excluded from the scope of management’s assessment of internal control over financial reporting as of december 30 2006 based on this assessment the company’s management believes that as of december 30 2006 our internal control over financial reporting was effective 

management’s assessment of the effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting as of december 30 2006 has been audited by deloitte  touche llp an independent registered public accounting firm as stated in their report which is included herein 

our management including the chief executive officer and chief financial officer does not expect that our internal control over financial reporting will prevent all error or fraud because of inherent limitations a system of internal control over financial reporting can provide only reasonable assurance and may not prevent or detect misstatements further because of changes in conditions effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting may vary over time 

report of independent registered public accounting firm 

to the board of directors and shareholders of snapon incorporated 

we have audited management’s assessment included in the accompanying management’s report on internal control over financial reporting that snapon incorporated and subsidiaries the “company” maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of december 30 2006 based on criteria established in internal control – integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission as described in management’s report on internal control over financial reporting management excluded from its assessment the internal control over financial reporting at proquest business solutions which was acquired on november 28 2006 and whose financial statements constitute 237 percent of net assets as of december 30 2006 and less than 1 percent of 2006 net sales accordingly our audit did not include the internal control over financial reporting at proquest business solutions the company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting our responsibility is to express an opinion on management’s assessment and an opinion on the effectiveness of the company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit 

we conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board united states those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting evaluating management’s assessment testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances we believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinions 

a company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by or under the supervision of the company’s principal executive and principal financial officers or persons performing similar functions and effected by the company’s board of directors management and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles a company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 1 pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company 2 provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company and 3 provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements 

because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis also projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate 

in our opinion management’s assessment that the company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of december 30 2006 is fairly stated in all material respects based on the criteria established in internal control— integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission also in our opinion the company maintained in all material respects effective internal control over financial reporting as of december 30 2006 based on the criteria established in internal control – integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission 

we have also audited in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board united states the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended december 30 2006 of the company and our report dated february 19 2007 expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements and included an explanatory paragraph relating to the adoption of statement of financial accounting standards no 123r sharebased payment and statement of financial accounting standards no 158 employers’ accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans – an amendment of fasb statements no 87 88 106 and 132r

 snapon also derives income from financing its products through soc and through snapon’s wholly owned finance subsidiaries snapon utilizes various financing programs to facilitate the sales of its products 

snapon established soc in january 1999 with newcourt financial usa inc now cit soc provides financial services to snapon’s us dealer and customer network and to snapon’s industrial and other customers beginning in 2004 snapon began consolidating soc on a prospective basis as a result of the january 4 2004 adoption of the financial accounting standards board’s interpretation no 46r “consolidation of variable interest entities an interpretation of arb no 51” see notes 2 and 7 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of soc 

soc originates loans primarily in three ways first extendedterm contracts are offered to technicians and shop owners to enable them to purchase tools and equipment on an extendedterm payment plan generally with an average term of 33 months second lease financing is offered to shop owners and managers both independent and national chains who purchase equipment items the duration of lease contracts is often two to five years third financing options are also available to dealers to meet a number of financing needs including van and truck leases working capital loans and loans to enable new dealers to fund the purchase of the franchise the duration of these contracts can be up to 10 years the above contracts are generally secured by the underlying tools or equipment financed and other dealer assets 

the majority of finance income is derived from the vehicle service industry in north america internationally snapon continues to provide financing directly to its dealer and customer networks through its wholly owned finance subsidiaries 

sales and distribution snapon markets and distributes its products and related services principally to professional tool and equipment users around the world the two largest market sectors are the vehicle service and repair sector and the industrial sector 

vehicle service and repair sector 

the vehicle service and repair sector has three main customer groups professional technicians who purchase tools and equipment for themselves vehicle service and repair shop owners and managers — including independent shops national chains and automotive dealerships — who purchase equipment for use by multiple technicians within a service or repair facility and vehicle manufacturers 

snapon provides innovative tool and equipment solutions as well as technical sales support and training to meet technicians’ evolving needs snapon’s franchised dealer van distribution system offers technicians the convenience of purchasing quality tools with minimal disruption of their work routine snapon also provides owners and managers of shops where technicians work with tools diagnostics equipment repair and service information and shop management products snapon provides vehicle manufacturers with products and services including tools consulting services and facilitation services snapon’s facilitation services include product procurement distribution and administrative support to customers for their dealership equipment programs 

major challenges for snapon and the vehicle service and repair sector include the increasing rate of technological change within motor vehicles and the resulting impact on the businesses of both our suppliers and customers that is necessitated by such change snapon believes it is a meaningful participant in the market sector for vehicle service and repair 

industrial sector 

snapon markets its products to a wide variety of industrial customers including industrial maintenance and repair operations manufacturing and assembly facilities government facilities schools and original equipment manufacturers that require instrumentation or service tools and equipment for their products 

major challenges in the industrial sector include a highly competitive costconscious environment and a trend toward customers making all of their tool purchases through one integrated supplier snapon believes it is a meaningful participant in the market sector for industrial tools and equipment 

distribution channels snapon serves customers primarily through three channels of distribution the mobile dealer van channel including the company’s tech rep organization company direct sales and distributors the following discussion represents snapon’s general approach for each channel and is not intended to be allinclusive 

dealers and tech reps 

in the united states the majority of sales to the vehicle service and repair sector are conducted through snapon’s dealers and its tech rep organization snapon’s dealers primarily serve vehicle service technicians and vehicle service shop owners generally providing weekly contact at the customer’s place of business dealers’ sales are concentrated in hand and power tools tool storage units and small diagnostic and shop equipment which can easily be transported in a van and demonstrated during a brief sales call dealers purchase snapon’s products at a discount from suggested retail prices and resell them at prices established by the dealer although some dealers have sales areas defined by other methods most us dealers are provided a list of places of business that serves as the basis of the dealer’s sales route 

since 1991 new us dealers and a majority of the pre1991 us dealers have been enrolled as franchisees of snapon in 2001 snapon began offering a trial franchise option to potential us dealers that do not meet the franchise qualification requirements trial franchisees typically have less upfront investment and are provided an initial base level of consigned inventory from snapon to assist them in gaining experience and building equity toward the future purchase of a standard franchise snapon also provides certain franchisees the opportunity to add vans to their franchise or to add a limited number of franchises snapon charges nominal initial and ongoing monthly license fees through soc financing is available to franchised dealers which includes van and truck leases working capital loans and loans to enable new dealers to fund the purchase of the franchise at 2005 year end 3498 us dealers approximately 95 were enrolled as franchisees or employed by franchisees as compared with 3726 us dealers approximately 95 at yearend 2004 

snapon has replicated its us dealer van method of distribution in certain other countries including australia canada germany japan the netherlands south africa and the united kingdom in many of these markets as in the united states purchase decisions are generally made or influenced by professional vehicle service technicians and shop owners snapon markets products in certain other countries through its subsidiary snapon tools international llc which sells to foreign distributors under license or contract with snapon internationally snapon offers financing to its franchised dealer and customer networks through its wholly owned finance subsidiaries 

snapon supports its dealers with a field organization of regional offices sales managers service centers and distribution centers snapon also provides sales and business training and marketing and product promotion programs as well as customer and dealer financing programs through soc and its wholly owned international finance operations all of which are designed to strengthen dealer sales in the united states and canada the national franchise advisory council and the snapon tools canadian franchise advisory council both of which are composed of dealers that are elected by dealers assist snapon in identifying and implementing enhancements to the franchise program 

in the united states dealers are supported by the tech rep sales force tech reps are specialists who demonstrate and sell higherpricepoint diagnostics and shop equipment as well as vehicle service shop management information systems tech reps work independently and with dealers to identify and generate sales leads among vehicle service shop owners and managers tech reps are snapon employees who are compensated primarily on the basis of commission a dealer receives a brokerage fee from certain sales made by the tech reps to the dealer’s customers most products sold through the dealer and tech rep organization are sold under the snapon  bluepoint sun and shopkey brand names 

company direct sales 

in the united states a significant proportion of shop equipment sales under the sun john bean wheeltronic white and blackhawk brands and information products under the mitchell1 brand are made by a direct sales force that has responsibility for national accounts as the vehicle service and repair sector consolidates with more business conducted by national chains automotive dealerships and franchised service centers the company believes these larger organizations can be serviced most effectively by sales people who can demonstrate and sell the full line of equipment and diagnostic products and services snapon also sells these products and services directly to vehicle manufacturers john bean white and blackhawk brands are sold directly to end customers primarily through sales leads generated from dealers and tech reps 

snapon brand tools and equipment are marketed to industrial and governmental customers in the united states through both industrial sales representatives who are employees and independent industrial distributors in most markets outside the united states industrial sales are conducted through independent distributors the sales representatives focus on industrial customers whose main purchase criteria are quality and service at the end of 2005 snapon had industrial sales representatives in the united states australia canada japan mexico puerto rico and some european countries with the united states representing the majority of snapon’s total industrial sales 

distributors 

sales of certain tools and equipment are made through independent vehicle service and industrial distributors who purchase the items from snapon and resell them to the end users hand tools under the bahco fish and hook design  belzer pradines and lindstrom brands and trade names for example are sold through distributors in europe north and south america asia and certain other parts of the world wheel service and other vehicle service equipment are sold through distributors primarily under brands including hofmann and kansas jack  hand tools under the irimo palmera and acesa brands and power tools under the sioux brand are differentiated from those products sold through the dealer tech rep and direct sales channels sun branded equipment is marketed through distributors in south america and asia  and through both a direct sales force and distributors in europe 

ecommerce 

snapon’s ecommerce development initiatives allow snapon to combine the capabilities of the internet with snapon’s existing brand sales and distribution strengths to reach new and underserved customer segments snapon offers current and prospective customers online aroundtheclock access to purchase snapon and bluepoint products through its public internet website at wwwsnaponcom  the site features an online catalog containing nearly 14000 products including snapon hand tools power tools tool storage units and diagnostic equipment available to consumers and professionals in the united states the united kingdom canada and australia at the end of 2005 snapon had more than 314000 registered users including approximately 30000 industrial accounts ecommerce and certain other system enhancement initiatives which are currently under development are designed to improve productivity and further leverage the oneonone relationships and service snapon has with its current and prospective customers through businesstobusiness and businesstoconsumer capabilities snapon and its dealers are enhancing communications with customers on a realtime 24hour 7day a week basis 

competition snapon competes on the basis of its product quality and performance product line breadth and depth service brand awareness and imagery and technological innovation while no single company competes with snapon across all of its product lines and distribution channels various companies compete in one or more product categories andor distribution channels 

snapon believes that it is a leading manufacturer and distributor of professional tools and equipment offering the broadest line of these products to the vehicle service industry the major competitors selling to professional technicians in the automotive service and repair sector through the mobile van channel include mac tools the stanley works matco danaher corporation and cornwell snapon also competes with companies that sell tools and equipment to automotive technicians through nonmobile van distributors including department stores such as sears roebuck and co home centers such as home depot inc and lowes companies inc auto supply outlets such as autozone inc and the pep boys and tool supply warehouses such as stampede and icn within the power tools category snapon’s major competitors include ingersollrand black  decker corporation bosch makita corporation chicago pneumatic atlas copco and milwaukee electric techtronic industries co ltd in the industrial sector major competitors include armstrong danaher corporation proto the stanley works irwin newell rubbermaid cooper industries and westward ww grainger the major competitors selling diagnostics and shop equipment to shop owners and managers in the vehicle service and repair sector include corghi spa fluke and hennessy danaher corporation robinair spx corporation otc hunter engineering and rotary lift and chief automotive dover corporation 

research and engineering research and engineering expenses totaled 500 million 582 million and 570 million in 2005 2004 and 2003 

raw materials and purchased product snapon’s supply of raw materials and purchased components are generally and readily available from numerous suppliers during 2004 and 2005 snapon experienced higher pricing related to certain grades and alloys of steel while snapon believes that steel prices will continue to remain high for 2006 the company does not anticipate experiencing any significant pricing or availability issues with regards to 2006 steel purchases 

patents trademarks and other intellectual property snapon vigorously pursues and relies on patent protection to protect its intellectual property and its position in its markets as of december 31 2005 snapon and its subsidiaries held over 800 active and pending patents in the united states and over 1700 active and pending patents outside of the united states sales relating to any single patent did not represent a material portion of snapon’s revenues in 2005 2004 or 2003 

examples of products that have features or designs that benefit from patent protection include wheel alignment systems wheel balancers sealed ratchets electronic torque instruments ratcheting screwdrivers emissionssensing devices diagnostic equipment and air conditioning equipment 

much of the technology used in the manufacture of vehicle service tools and equipment is in the public domain snapon relies primarily on trade secret protection to protect proprietary processes used in manufacturing methods and processes are patented when appropriate copyright protection is also utilized when appropriate 

trademarks used by snapon are of continuing importance to snapon in the marketplace trademarks have been registered in the united states and more than 100 other countries and additional applications for trademark registrations are pending snapon vigorously polices proper use of its trademarks snapon’s right to manufacture and sell certain products is dependent upon licenses from others however these products under license do not represent a material portion of snapon’s sales 

domain names have become a valuable corporate asset for companies around the world including snapon domain names often contain a trademark or service mark or even a corporate name and are often considered intellectual property the recognition and value of the snapon name trademark and domain name are core strengths of the company snapon has undertaken an initiative to centralize the administration of all domestic and international domain names including all registrations and renewals snapon also monitors new developments in toplevel domains and countrycode domains in order to preserve snapon’s right to relevant domain names 

snapon is selectively and strategically licensing the snapon brand to carefully selected manufacturing and distribution companies including apparel work boots and a variety of other goods in order to build equity and market presence for the company’s strongest brand 

environment snapon is subject to various environmental laws ordinances regulations and other requirements of government authorities in the united states and other nations at snapon these environmental liabilities are managed through the snapon environmental hygiene and safety management system “eh  sms” which is applied worldwide the system is based upon continual improvement and is certified to iso 140011996 and ohsas 180011999 verified through det norske veritas dnv certification inc 

snapon believes that it complies with applicable environmental control requirements in its operations expenditures on environmental matters through eh  sms have not had and snapon does not for the foreseeable future expect them to have a material effect upon snapon’s capital expenditures earnings or competitive position 

employees at the end of january 2006 snapon employed approximately 11400 people compared to approximately 11600 people at the end of january 2005 the yearoveryear reduction primarily reflects the impact of restructuringrelated and management realignment actions at various snapon facilities 

approximately 3200 employees or 28 of snapon’s worldwide workforce are represented by unions andor covered under collective bargaining agreements of these approximately 1240 are covered under various european national union agreements that are renewed on an annual basis approximately 610 employees are covered under agreements expiring in 2006 including approximately 280 covered under various european national union agreements in recent years snapon has not experienced any significant work slowdowns stoppages or other labor disruptions 

the number of covered union employees whose contracts expire within the next five years is approximately 610 in 2006 1220 in 2007 1040 in 2008 270 in 2009 and zero in 2010 

there can be no assurance that future contracts with snapon’s unions will be renegotiated upon terms acceptable to snapon 

working capital as most of snapon’s business is not seasonal and its inventory needs are relatively constant no unusual working capital needs arise during the year snapon does not have a significant backlog of orders at december 31 2005 

snapon’s financial condition and use of working capital are discussed in “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” 

neither snapon nor any of its segments except financial services depend on any single customer small group of customers or government for any material part of its revenues as a result of soc’s relationship with cit snapon’s financial services business segment depends on cit for more than 10 of its revenues 




 item 1a risk factors in evaluating the company careful consideration should be given to the following risk factors in addition to the other information included in this annual report on form 10k each of these risk factors could adversely affect the company’s business operating results andor financial condition as well as adversely affect the value of an investment in the company’s common stock in addition to the following disclosures please refer to the other information contained in this report including the consolidated financial statements and the related notes 

the success of snapon’s mobile van tool distribution business depends on the success of its franchisees 

approximately 42 of our 2005 net revenues were generated by the snapon dealer group which consists of snapon’s business operations serving the worldwide franchised dealer van channel except in limited circumstances each of our mobile tool vans is operated by a franchisee pursuant to a franchise agreement snapon’s success is dependent on its relationships with franchisees individually and collectively as they are the primary sales and service link between the company and vehicle service and repair technicians who are an important class of end users for snapon’s products and services if our franchisees are not successful or if we do not maintain an effective relationship with our franchisees the delivery of products the collection of receivables andor our relationship with end users could be adversely affected and thereby negatively impact our financial results 

in addition if we are unable to maintain effective relationships with franchisees the company or the franchisees may choose to terminate the relationship which may result in i open routes in which enduse customers are not provided reliable service ii litigation resulting from termination andor iii reduced collections or increased writeoffs of franchisee receivables owed to snapon as snapon has nearly 5000 franchisees worldwide and most of these franchise relationships are governed by contract it is not uncommon for litigation to result from the termination of these relationships 

the steps taken to restructure operations rationalize operating footprint lower operating expenses and achieve greater efficiencies in the supply chain could disrupt business 

in 2006 we expect to take additional steps to drive further efficiencies and reduce costs some of which could be disruptive to our business these steps include strategic actions to increase the sustainable success sales and profitability for snapon and its operating segments these actions collectively across our operating groups are focused on the following 

     specific initiatives in each of these areas are underway snapon believes that by executing on these focus areas along with a continued commitment to new innovative products and rapid continuous improvement to drive lower costs the company and its franchisees will realize stronger growth and profitability failure to succeed in the implementation of any or all of these actions could result in our being unable to achieve our financial goals and could be disruptive to the business 

in addition reductions to headcount and other cost cutting measures may result in the loss of technical expertise that could adversely affect our research and development efforts and ability to meet product development schedules efforts to reduce components of expense could result in the recording of charges for inventory and technologyrelated writeoffs workforce reduction costs or other charges relating to the consolidation of facilities if we were to incur a substantial charge to further these efforts our earnings or loss per share would be adversely affected in such period if we are unable to effectively manage our cost reduction and restructuring efforts our business results of operations and financial condition could be harmed 

information technology infrastructure is critical to supporting business objectives 

we depend heavily on information technology infrastructure to achieve our business objectives if a problem occurs that impairs this infrastructure the resulting disruption could impede our ability to record or process orders manufacture and ship in a timely manner or otherwise carry on business in the normal course any such events could cause us to lose customers or revenue and could require us to incur significant expense to remediate 

in association with initiatives to better integrate business units rationalize operating footprint and improve responsiveness to franchisees and customers snapon is replacing and enhancing its existing global enterprise resource planning “erp” management information system the integration implementation and deployment of new information technology processes and a common information infrastructure is expected to cover a period of several years we could experience disruptions in our business as we implement the system enhancements including the possibility that the new system may not perform as expected which could have an adverse effect on our business 

the recognition of impairment charges on goodwill would adversely impact future financial position and results of operations   

we are required to perform impairment tests on our goodwill balance annually or at any time when events occur which could impact the value of our business segments our determination of whether impairment has occurred is based on a comparison of each of our reporting units’ fair market value with its carrying value significant and unanticipated changes could require a provision for impairment in a future period that could substantially affect our reported earnings and reduce our consolidated net worth and shareholders’ equity 

business interruptions for franchisees could adversely impact operating results 

franchisees have historically experienced business interruptions due to adverse weather conditions or other extraordinary events such as hurricanes in the southern united states and wild fires in california to the extent our franchisees experience future similar events our operating results may be adversely impacted 

exposure to credit risks of customers and resellers may make it difficult to collect receivables and could adversely affect operating results and financial condition 

industry and economic conditions have the potential to weaken the financial position of some of our customers if circumstances surrounding our customers’ financial capabilities were to deteriorate such writedowns or writeoffs would negatively affect our operating results for the period in which they occur and if large could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition 

failure to maintain effective distribution of products and services could adversely impact revenue gross margin and profitability 

we use a variety of distribution methods to sell our products and services successfully managing the interaction of our distribution efforts to reach various potential customer segments for our products and services is a complex process moreover since each distribution method has distinct risks and gross margins our failure to implement the most advantageous balance in the delivery model for our products and services could adversely affect our revenue and gross margins and therefore our profitability 

risks associated with the disruption of manufacturing operations could adversely affect profitability or competitive position 

we manufacture a significant portion of the products we sell any prolonged disruption in the operations of our existing manufacturing facilities whether due to technical or labor difficulties lack of raw material or component availability destruction of or damage to any facility including natural disasters use and storage of hazardous materials or other events or other reasons could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

the ability to provide financing alternatives to enduser customers and franchisees could adversely impact operating results 

an integral component of snapon’s business and profitability is its ability to provide financing alternatives to enduser customers and franchisees domestic financing operations are managed through a joint venture with cit historically cit has been the exclusive purchaser of the credit and installment financing arranged by soc deterioration of the relationship between the joint venture partners or if the joint venture should be unexpectedly dissolved could have an adverse impact on snapon’s results of operations and ability to provide financing to enduser customers and franchisees in the united states in addition adverse fluctuations in interest rates andor the ability to provide competitive financing programs to enduser customers and franchisees could negatively affect the level of credit originations and the relationships with franchisees and enduser customers all of which could have an adverse impact on snapon’s revenue and profitability further because of the company’s reliance on the franchised dealer network to generate credit originations a decline in the number of dealers andor the amount of enduser customers being serviced by dealers could have an adverse impact on the volume of credit originations and snapon’s results of operations 

the global tool and equipment industry is competitive 

we face strong competition in all of our market segments price competition in our various industries is intense and pricing pressures from competitors and customers are increasing in general as a manufacturer and marketer of premium products and services the expectations of snapon’s customers and its franchisees are high and increasing any inability to maintain customer satisfaction could diminish snapon’s premium image and its reputation with a resulting lessening of its ability to command premium pricing we expect that the level of competition will remain high in the future which could limit our ability to maintain or increase market share or profitability 

the inability to continue to introduce new products that respond to customer needs and achieve market acceptance could result in lower revenues and reduced profitability 

sales from new products represent a significant portion of our net sales and are expected to continue to represent a significant component of our future net sales we may not be able to compete effectively unless we continue to enhance existing products or introduce new products to the marketplace in a timely manner product improvements and new product introductions require significant financial and other resources including significant planning design development and testing at the technological product and manufacturing process levels our competitors’ new products may beat our products to market be more effective with more features be less expensive than our products andor render our products obsolete any new products that we develop may not receive market acceptance or otherwise generate any meaningful net sales or profits for us relative to our expectations based on among other things existing and anticipated investments in manufacturing capacity and commitments to fund advertising marketing promotional programs and research and development 

raw material and energy price fluctuations and shortages including steel and various fuel sources could adversely affect the ability to obtain needed manufacturing materials and could adversely affect results of operations 

the principal raw material used in the manufacture of our products is steel which we purchase in competitive pricesensitive markets to meet snapon’s high quality standards our steel needs range from specialized alloys which are available only from a limited group of approved suppliers to commodity types of alloys these raw materials have historically exhibited price and demand cyclicality some of these materials have been and in the future may be in short supply as some steel alloys require specialized manufacturing procedures we could experience inventory shortages if we were required to use an alternative manufacturer on short notice additionally unexpected price increases could result in higher prices to our customers or an erosion of the margins on our products 

we believe our ability to sell our products is also dependent on the number of vehicles on the road the number of miles driven and the general aging of vehicles these factors affect the frequency type and amount of service and repair performed on vehicles by technicians and therefore affect the demand for the number of technicians the prosperity of the technicians and subsequently the demand they have for our tools other products and services and the value they place on those products and services to the extent that gasoline prices increase consumers may turn to other nongasoline based methods of transportation including more frequent use of public transportation a decrease in the use of gasoline consuming vehicles may lead to fewer repairs and less demand for our products 

foreign operations are subject to currency exchange and political risks that could adversely affect results of operations 

approximately 43 of our revenues in 2005 were generated outside of the united states future growth rates and success of our business depends in large part on continued growth in our nonus operations including growth in emerging markets numerous risks and uncertainties affect our nonus operations these risks and uncertainties include political economic and social instability including acts of war civil disturbance or acts of terrorism local labor conditions changes in government policies and regulations including imposition or increases in withholding and other taxes on remittances and other payments by international subsidiaries and enforcement of contract and intellectual property rights we are also affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates inflation rates and interest rates additionally cash generated in nonus jurisdictions may be difficult to transfer to the united states in a taxefficient manner 

failure to adequately protect intellectual property could adversely affect business 

intellectual property rights are an important and integral component of our business we attempt to protect our intellectual property rights through a combination of patent trademark copyright and trade secret laws as well as licensing agreements and thirdparty nondisclosure and assignment agreements adverse determinations in a judicial or administrative proceeding could prevent us from manufacturing and selling our products or prevent us from stopping others from manufacturing and selling competing products failure to obtain or maintain adequate protection of our intellectual property rights for any reason could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

compliance with new regulatory and accounting requirements could adversely impact future financial position and results of operations 

compliance with future regulatory and accounting requirements including changes related to the accounting for employee stock option issuances as compensation expense will have an adverse impact on our operating results changes as a result of proposed legislation to reform the funding and reporting of pension plan benefits as well as changes in market conditions that impact the assumptions used to measure pension liabilities under these plans could adversely affect our operating results financial position and cash flows 

as a result of compliance with the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 as well as changes to listing standards adopted by the new york stock exchange and the attestation and accounting changes required by the sec we are required to implement additional internal controls improve our existing internal controls and comprehensively document and test our internal controls in recent years we have experienced higher costs from additional outside accounting legal and advisory services to comply with these requirements should snapon experience a significant deterioration in its internal control environment at a financially significant snapon facility or business the impact of such could adversely affect our financial position and results of operations 

the inability to successfully defend claims from taxing authorities could adversely affect operating results and financial position 

we conduct business in many countries which requires us to interpret the income tax laws and rulings in each of those taxing jurisdictions due to the subjectivity of tax laws between those jurisdictions as well as the subjectivity of factual interpretations our estimates of income tax liabilities may differ from actual payments or assessments claims from taxing authorities related to these differences could have an adverse impact on our operating results and financial position 

failure to attract and retain qualified personnel could lead to a loss of revenue or profitability 

snapon’s success depends in part on the efforts and abilities of its senior management team and other key employees their skills experience and industry contacts significantly benefit our operations and administration the failure to attract and retain members of our senior management team and other key employees could have a negative effect on our operating results 

risks associated with acquisition activities could have an adverse impact on results of operations and financial position 

acquisitions involve risks and uncertainties that can include 

    future acquisitions could cause us to incur additional debt earnings dilution contingent liabilities increased interest expense and amortization expenses related to intangible assets impairment losses on goodwill and intangible assets with an indefinite life or restructuring charges could also occur as a result of acquisitions

snapon is also involved in various legal matters that are being litigated andor settled in the ordinary course of business in certain matters former dealers purportedly on behalf of current and former franchised dealers are seeking adjudication of certain claims as a class within an arbitration proceeding as an initial step certain claimants have successfully asserted in arbitration the right to further proceedings to determine whether class certification in arbitration would be appropriate snapon will continue to vigorously assert defenses in these matters including its belief that class certification is not appropriate snapon has taken steps in court to maintain its right to challenge adverse results of the arbitral proceedings depending upon future developments and circumstances in these matters snapon will continue to pursue all available strategies from dispositive class motions to settlement it is not possible to predict the outcome of these legal matters due in part to the uncertainty inherent in legal proceedings including the absence of precedents and clear procedures regarding class proceedings in arbitration 

snapon held over 2500 active or pending patents as of yearend 2005 and snapon vigorously prosecutes its claims and defends its patents in the ordinary course of business

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations management overview in november 2004 mr jack d michaels was elected chairman president and chief executive officer of snapon after having previously served as a member of snapon’s board of directors since 1998 shortly thereafter snapon announced nearterm priorities to improve operating efficiencies respond to customer needs and market changes more quickly address performance issues in its commercial and industrial businesses and generally accelerate the pace of change towards achieving longterm profitable growth 

during 2005 measurable progress in each of these areas was realized significant improvement was made in “firsttime fill rates” — an important element of manufacturing effectiveness and in tracking service to customers and franchisees as of yearend 2005 fill rates in the snapon dealer group improved 19 prioryear fill rates had been adversely impacted by the disruption caused from the closure of two us hand tool plants in 2004 

initiatives to improve organizational alignment and working capital reduce complexity and lower costs were launched early in 2005 these efforts coupled with the introduction of rapid continuous improvement “rci” resulted in a 120 basispoint increase in operating earnings margin for the year largely from the improvement achieved in the commercial and industrial group and a 36 increase in sales per associate year over year despite the lower sales volume in 2005 operating earnings margin as a percent of revenue increased to 71 in 2005 as compared to 59 in 2004 despite a slight decline in total revenue from prioryear levels additionally rci is now becoming a part of the snapon culture and is helping ensure that progress continues towards further improving manufacturing efficiencies and reducing costs 

while this progress is encouraging the company believes more must be done to improve snapon’s operating performance our strategic priorities and plans for 2006 continue to build on the improvement initiatives already underway in the commercial and industrial and the diagnostics and information groups while expanded efforts are being launched to strengthen the operating and financial performance of the snapon dealer group these priorities and plans are aimed at enabling us to continue the progress made in achieving our longterm goals of profitably growing sales further lowering costs and maintaining strong cash flow 

significant progress has been made in improving the operating performance of the commercial and industrial group snapon rationalized brands and the group’s operating footprint moved toward lowercost sourcing and manufacturing and created an integrated paneuropean marketing presence investments have also been made to support advanced technology products such as snapon’s nextgeneration tire and wheel service equipment introduced in the last two years and to establish an operating presence in emerging growth markets such as china india and eastern europe as a result snapon is seeing improved levels of customer service market penetration and profitability 

while yearoveryear segment revenue grew slightly from 111 billion in 2004 to 113 billion in 2005 operating earnings grew to 696 million from 235 million in 2004 snapon’s 2006 plans for the commercial and industrial group builds on this success and on the following strategic priorities 

    22 

in the diagnostics and information group  significant accomplishments have been made during the past three years as a result of our strategic focus on creating an integrated “instrumentation with information” business 

   for 2005 the diagnostics and information group’s segment revenue declined to 4327 million from 4870 million in 2004 reflecting the comparison against the successful global launch of new snapon brand diagnostics products in the prior year as well as the impact of lower original equipment manufacturer “oem” facilitation sales year over year notwithstanding the lower sales operating margin improved to 108 in 2005 as compared to 97 in the prior year 

strategic priorities for the diagnostics and information group in 2006 will continue to emphasize process improvements and new products such as the recent launch of the new mitchell1 ™ customer service programs snapon also expects to leverage its marketleading capabilities to capitalize on the growing need for products and services related to advanced diagnostics vehicle interface and datastream communications 

in the snapon dealer group  total revenue declined to 9945 million in 2005 from 10 billion in the prior year largely due to a decrease in the average number of us franchise dealer vans in operation compared with the prior year despite the yearoveryear revenue decline operating earnings were 822 million in 2005 compared with 804 million in 2004 

during 2005 considerable effort was made in the snapon dealer group to evaluate and analyze marketplace data the existing franchise business and its growth potential these efforts reaffirmed the growth opportunities available to snapon as well as the competitive strengths of the company – namely the snapon brand the company’s mobile van tool distribution system which is the preferred distribution system for the automotive service industry and the substantial breadth and experience of snapon’s franchisees 

to fully capitalize on these strengths the snapon dealer group also concluded that more investment would enhance the company’s responsiveness to its franchisees and customers and identify better ways to assist franchisees in strengthening their businesses accordingly snapon’s 2006 strategic priorities to increase sales and profitability for the snapon dealer group are focused on the following 

    specific initiatives in each of these areas are underway snapon believes that by executing on these focus areas along with a continued commitment to new innovative products and rci to drive lower costs the company and its franchisees will realize stronger growth and profitability 

in 2005 snapon also continued its emphasis on improving cash flow cash on hand at the end of 2005 increased to 1704 million from 1500 million at yearend 2004 in 2005 net cash provided by operating activities increased to 2211 million from 1468 million in 2004 the company used cash flow to in part pay dividends totaling 578 million and to repurchase 912100 shares of snapon common stock for 321 million snapon also retired 100 million of 6625 10year notes with available cash during the fourth quarter of 2005 upon their maturity and invested 401 million in capital expenditures to largely improve manufacturing efficiency and flexibility 

over the last several years the company has also been focused on improving cash flow and asset utilization by making more effective use of its investment in certain working capital items in 2005 snapon made considerable progress in its efforts to further reduce inventory levels and days sales outstanding from the improvements attained in 2004 as of yearend 2005 inventory decreased 587 million from prior year including 192 million from currency translation and days sales outstanding improved to 74 days from 81 days at yearend 2004 

results of operations fiscal 2005 vs fiscal 2004 highlights of snapon’s results of operations for the fiscal years ended december 31 2005 fiscal 2005 and january 1 2005 fiscal 2004 are as follows 

 total revenue in 2005 decreased 450 million or 19 from prioryear levels due to lower financial services revenue of 245 million and lower net sales of 205 million the 205 million decrease in net sales includes 331 million of lower sales partially offset by 126 million of favorable currency translation the 331 million net sales decline principally reflects the impact of lower sales in the company’s north american franchise operations along with lower sales in the oem facilitation and worldwide equipment businesses partially offset by increased sales of tools for industrial and commercial applications including growth in emerging markets and higher international dealer sales 

gross profit defined as net sales less cost of goods sold was 10199 million or 442 of net sales in 2005 as compared to 10093 million or 433 in 2004 the 106 million or 90 basis points 100 basis points equals 10 percent improvement in yearoveryear gross profit primarily reflects benefits from higher selling prices and lower costs including benefits from efficiency and productivity initiatives of 154 million higher “lastin firstout” “lifo” inventory benefits of 56 million 32 million of favorable currency translation and 25 million of lower pension postretirement and insurance expenses due in part to favorable demographic changes in the company’s us hourly pension plans including a decline in the number of participants these yearoveryear improvements in gross profit were partially offset by the impact of the lower sales volume higher production costs in us manufacturing facilities to improve orderfill rates and 223 million of higher steel costs restructuring costs included in “cost of goods sold” on the accompanying consolidated statements of earnings totaled 30 million in 2005 as compared to 160 million in 2004 

operating expenses in 2005 decreased 396 million or 100 basis points as a percentage of total revenue from prioryear levels the decline in yearoveryear operating expenses primarily reflects benefits of 414 million from efficiency and cost reduction initiatives 127 million of lower bad debt expense and dealer termination costs as well as the absence in 2005 of both the 36 million charge for the us general services administration “gsa” settlement and the 33 million of severance costs related to the november 2004 resignation of the company’s former chairman president and chief executive officer “former officer” these decreases in yearoveryear operating expenses were partially offset by 69 million of higher pension postretirement and insurance expenses primarily due to demographic and actuarial assumption changes in the company’s us salaried pension plans 50 million of higher freight costs largely due to fuel surcharges and more frequent shipments to dealers 40 million of unfavorable currency translation and 30 million of costs to terminate a supplier relationship restructuring costs included in “operating expenses” on the accompanying consolidated statements of earnings totaled 163 million in 2005 as compared to 57 million in 2004 

interest expense of 217 million in 2005 was lower than the 230 million incurred in 2004 primarily due to benefits from lower average debt levels including the fourthquarter 2005 repayment of 100 million of unsecured 6625 notes on october 3 2005 partially offset by the impact of higher yearoveryear interest rates 

other income expense – net was income of 17 million in 2005 as compared to income of 11 million in 2004 this line item includes the impact of all nonoperating items such as interest income minority interest hedging and currency exchange rate transaction gains and losses and other miscellaneous nonoperating items benefits from higher yearoveryear interest income and foreign exchange gains in 2005 as compared with foreign exchange losses in 2004 were partially offset by an increase in minority interest expense minority interest expense was 36 million in 2005 as compared to 20 million in 2004

at december 31 2005 snapon also had 20 million of unused committed bank lines of credit of which 10 million expires on july 31 2006 and 10 million expires on august 31 2006 at december 31 2005 snapon had approximately 420 million of unused available debt capacity under the terms of its revolving credit facility and committed bank lines of credit 

snapon maintains sufficient committed lines of credit and liquidity facilities to cover its expected funding needs on both a shortterm and longterm basis snapon manages its aggregate shortterm borrowings so as not to exceed its availability under its revolving credit facility and committed lines of credit the company accesses shortterm debt markets predominantly through commercial paper issuances to fund its shortterm requirements and to ensure nearterm liquidity nearterm liquidity requirements for snapon in 2006 include the funding of its investments in capital expenditures restructuring activities and payments of dividends and share repurchases snapon expects to make contributions to its foreign pension plans in 2006 of 62 million snapon is not required to make a contribution to its domestic pension plans in 2006 depending on market and other conditions however snapon may elect to make discretionary cash contributions to its domestic pension plans in 2006 

as funding needs are determined to be of a longerterm nature snapon could access medium and longterm debt markets as appropriate to refinance shortterm borrowings and thus replenish its shortterm liquidity snapon’s longterm financing strategy is to maintain continuous access to the debt markets to accommodate its liquidity needs for additional information on snapon’s debt and credit facilities see note 10 to the consolidated financial statements

depreciation in 2005 was 495 million compared with 585 million in 2004 and 582 million in 2003 the decline in 2005 depreciation from prioryear levels reflects the absence of depreciation for both the company’s northamerican based erp system which became fully depreciated midyear 2004 and the two us handtool facilities that were closed in 2004 amortization expense was 27 million in 2005 25 million in 2004 and 21 million in 2003

 snapon entered into a 20year 257 million capital lease commitment in 2005 for office and distribution facilities for the snapon dealer group operations in japan the impact of recording the capital lease commitment was excluded from the accompanying consolidated statements of cash flow as the recording of the capital lease commitment was a “noncash” item

snapon is and has been engaged in the handling manufacture use and disposal of many substances classified as hazardous or toxic by one or more regulatory agencies the company believes that as a general matter its handling manufacture use and disposal of these substances are in accordance with environmental laws and regulations it is possible however that future knowledge or other developments such as improved capability to detect substances in the environment or increasingly strict environmental laws and standards and enforcement policies could bring into question the company’s handling manufacture use or disposal of these substances 

consolidated joint venture soc a consolidated 50owned joint venture between snapon and cit provides a broad range of financial services to snapon’s us dealer and customer network and to snapon’s industrial and other customers snapon began consolidating soc as of january 4 2004 the beginning of snapon’s 2004 fiscal year as a result of the adoption of fin no 46r snapon previously accounted for soc using the equity method snapon and cit have identical voting and participation rights and responsibilities in soc see notes 2 and 7 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of soc

cit and snapon have agreed to lend funds to support soc’s working capital requirements on a 5050 basis with a combined maximum borrowing limit not to exceed 24 million as of december 31 2005 soc owed both snapon and cit 39 million each pursuant to this agreement

new accounting standards see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of new accounting standards 

critical accounting policies the consolidated financial statements and related notes contain information that is pertinent to management’s discussion and analysis the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period these estimates are generally based on historical experience current conditions and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily available from other sources as well as identifying and assessing our accounting treatment with respect to commitments and contingencies actual results could differ from those estimates snapon considers the following policies to be the most critical in understanding the judgments that are involved in the preparation of the company’s consolidated financial statements and the uncertainties that could impact the company’s financial position results of operations and cash flow 

allowances for doubtful accounts snapon’s accounts receivable are reported net of estimated bad debt allowances which are regularly evaluated by management for adequacy the evaluations take into consideration various financial and qualitative factors that may affect customers’ ability to pay these factors may include customers’ financial condition collateral debtservicing capacity past payment experience and credit bureau information snapon regularly reviews the allowance estimation process and adjusts the allowances as appropriate it is possible however that the accuracy of snapon’s estimation process could be adversely impacted if the financial condition of its customers were to deteriorate the company does not believe that accounts receivable represent significant concentrations of credit risk because of the diversified portfolio of individual customers and geographical areas 

inventory valuation snapon values its inventory at the lower of cost or market and adjusts for the value of inventory that is estimated to be excess obsolete or otherwise unmarketable inventory adjustments for raw materials are largely based on analysis of raw material age and actual physical inspection of raw material for fitness for use as part of evaluating workinprogress and finished goods management reviews individual product stockkeeping units skus by product category and product life cycle cost adjustments for each product categoryproduct lifecycle state are generally established and maintained based on a combination of historical experience forecasted sales and promotions technological obsolescence inventory age and other actual known conditions and circumstances should actual product marketability and raw material fitness for use be affected by conditions that are different from management estimates further adjustments to inventory allowances may be required 

warranty accruals snapon provides product warranties for specific product lines and accrues for estimated future warranty costs in the period in which the sale is recorded snapon calculates its accrual requirements based on historic warranty loss experience that is periodically adjusted for recent actual experience including the timing of claims during the warranty period and actual costs incurred see note 16 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of snapon’s warranty accrual 

pension benefits the calculation of snapon’s pension expense and projected benefit obligation requires the use of a number of assumptions changes in these assumptions are primarily influenced by factors outside of snapon’s control and can have a significant effect on the amounts reported in the financial statements snapon believes that the two most critical assumptions are the expected return on plan assets and the assumed discount rate 

for a discussion of the development of snapon’s pension plans and expected return on plan assets assumption see note 12 to the consolidated financial statements pension expense increases as the expected rate of return on plan assets decreases lowering the expected rate of return assumption for snapon’s domestic pension plan assets by 05 would increase snapon’s 2006 domestic pension expense by approximately 3 million at yearend 2005 snapon’s domestic plan assets comprised approximately 90 of snapon’s worldwide pension plan assets 

snapon establishes the discount rate using the current rates earned on longterm bonds with a moody’s aa rating pension expense and projected benefit obligation both increase as the discount rate is reduced lowering snapon’s domestic discount rate assumption by 05 would increase snapon’s 2006 domestic pension expense and projected benefit obligation by approximately 37 million and 503 million respectively at yearend 2005 snapon’s domestic projected benefit obligation comprised approximately 84 of snapon’s worldwide projected benefit obligation 

income taxes the company records a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized while the company has considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance if these estimates and assumptions change in the future the company may be required to adjust its valuation allowance this could result in a charge to or an increase in income in the period such determination is made 

in addition the company operates within multiple taxing jurisdictions and is subject to audit in these jurisdictions the company records accruals for the estimated outcomes of these audits and the accruals may change in the future due to new developments in each matter 

outlook snapon expects to improve its current 71 operating margin to 10 or greater over the next three years as it continues making progress towards a targeted longterm goal of a midteens operating margin snapon believes its endcustomer markets will grow at rates approximating gross domestic product gdp and that the successful achievement of its plans and initiatives should improve the company’s market share over time 

for 2006 snapon expects on a consolidated basis continued improving performance in the commercial and industrial and the diagnostics and information groups to be offset by a higher level of spending in the snapon dealer group particularly in the first two quarters of 2006 as it implements certain initiatives to improve its franchise system resulting in an expected decline in dealer segment operating earnings year over year in 2006 on a consolidated basis this is expected to result in modestly lower yearoveryear net earnings in the first two quarters of 2006 snapon expects a recovery in its net earnings performance to occur in the second half of 2006 and to make steady progress into 2007 

consolidated net sales in 2006 are expected to grow at a lowsingledigit rate year over year reflecting increased sales in all segments except the snapon dealer group where sales are expected to remain flat for the full year 

in the commercial and industrial and the diagnostics and information business segments snapon expects that the realization of its strategic priorities will result in increased operating earnings in 2006 over the level of 2005 tempering this growth in 2006 will be an expected 10 million to 15 million of higher operating spending to continue the company’s expansion in asia and other emerging growth markets and to support innovative new informationbased diagnostics products 

in the snapon dealer segment the company expects to incur approximately 15 million of incremental costs in 2006 to increase field support and to support other franchise system initiatives an additional 8 million to 10 million of investment spending will be necessary in 2006 to support customer service and supply chain initiatives and to support important new marketing programs to increase market share it is expected that the benefits of these programs will reduce inventories increase the number of technicians being served and lower costs snapon also expects to realize 13 million of annual cost savings in 2006 associated with ongoing initiatives to further improve its manufacturing facilities the company will invest an additional 10 million to 15 million of capital expenditures to upgrade us manufacturing plants 

additionally as part of ongoing initiatives aimed at integrating the company’s global operating footprint and lowering its cost structure snapon expects to incur restructuring costs of approximately 20 million in 2006 consistent with 2005 levels 

in the financial services segment snapon expects results to continue to be under pressure from rising interest rates although not as significantly as in 2005 

snapon also anticipates that the impact of adopting new stock option accounting rules at current and anticipated grant levels will reduce consolidated operating income in 2006 by approximately 6 million to 8 million as a result of retiring 100 million of its debt in october 2005 snapon expects lower interest expense for 2006 snapon believes its 2006 effective tax rate will approximate 35 compared with the 372 incurred in 2005 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market credit and economic risks market risk is the potential economic loss that may result from adverse changes in the fair value of financial instruments snapon is exposed to market risk from changes in both foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates snapon monitors its exposure to these risks and attempts to manage the underlying economic exposures through the use of financial instruments such as forward exchange contracts and interest rate swap agreements snapon does not use derivative instruments for speculative or trading purposes snapon’s broadbased business activities help to reduce the impact that volatility in any particular area or related areas may have on its operating earnings as a whole snapon’s management takes an active role in the risk management process and has developed policies and procedures that require specific administrative and business functions to assist in the identification assessment and control of various risks 

foreign currency risk management snapon has significant international operations and is subject to certain risks inherent with foreign operations that include currency fluctuations and restrictions on movement of funds foreign exchange risk exists to the extent that snapon has payment obligations or receipts denominated in currencies other than the functional currency to manage these exposures snapon identifies naturally offsetting positions and then generally purchases hedging instruments to protect the residual net anticipated exposures snapon’s financial position and results of operations have not been materially affected by such events to date see note 11 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of foreign currency risk management 

interest rate risk management snapon’s interest rate risk management policies are designed to reduce the potential earnings volatility that could arise from changes in interest rates through the use of interest rate swaps snapon aims to stabilize funding costs by managing the exposure created by the differing maturities and interest rate structures of snapon’s assets and liabilities see note 11 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of interest rate risk management 

snapon utilizes a valueatrisk “var” model to determine the potential oneday loss in the fair value of its interest rate and foreign exchangesensitive financial instruments from adverse changes in market factors the var model estimates were made assuming normal market conditions and a 95 confidence level snapon’s computations are based on the interrelationships among movements in various currencies and interest rates variancecovariance technique these interrelationships were determined by observing interest rate and foreign currency market changes over the preceding quarter 

the estimated maximum potential oneday loss in fair value calculated using the var model at december 31 2005 was 03 million on interest ratesensitive financial instruments and 04 million on foreign currencysensitive financial instruments the var model is a risk management tool and does not purport to represent actual losses in fair value that will be incurred by snapon nor does it consider the potential effect of favorable changes in market factors 

credit risk credit risk is the possibility of loss from a customer’s failure to make payments according to contract terms prior to granting credit each customer is evaluated taking into consideration the borrower’s financial condition collateral debtservicing capacity past payment experience credit bureau information and other financial and qualitative factors that may affect the borrower’s ability to repay specific credit reviews and standard industry credit scoring models are used in performing this evaluation loans that have been granted are typically monitored through an assetqualityreview process that closely monitors past due accounts and initiates collection actions when appropriate in addition to its direct credit risk exposure snapon also has credit risk exposure for certain soc loan originations with recourse provisions against snapon primarily for dealer van loans at december 31 2005 192 million of loans originated by soc have a recourse provision to snapon if the loans become more than 90 days past due for additional information on soc refer to the section entitled “consolidated joint venture” in this management’s discussion and analysis and notes 2 and 7 to the consolidated financial statements 

commodity risk the company is a purchaser of certain commodities including steel and energy sources such as natural gas and electricity the company is also a purchaser of components and parts that are integrated into the company’s end products as well as the purchaser of certain finished goods all of which may contain various commodities including steel aluminum and others snapon’s supply of raw materials and purchased components are generally and readily available from numerous suppliers 

snapon experienced higher pricing related to certain grades and alloys of steel in 2004 and 2005 due to global demand for these materials the company generally buys these commodities based upon market prices that are established with the vendor as part of the purchase process the company does not anticipate experiencing any significant pricing or availability issues with regards to 2006 raw material steel purchases 

several of the company’s distribution channels particularly the mobile dealer van channel can be significantly impacted by increases in gasoline and fuel prices as these costs rise dealers may limit their driving resulting in fewer customer calls and generally lower product sales snapon also experienced higher fuel surcharges on material and product shipments in 2005 as a result of the increase in gasoline and fuel prices 

to the extent that commodity prices increase and the company does not have firm pricing agreements with its suppliers the company may experience margin declines to the extent that it is not able to increase the selling prices of its products

 snapon also derives income from financing its products through soc a 50owned financial services joint venture and through snapon’s wholly owned finance subsidiaries snapon utilizes various financing programs to facilitate the sales of its products 

snapon established soc in january 1999 with newcourt financial usa inc now the cit group inc “cit” soc provides financial services to snapon’s us dealer and customer network and to snapon’s industrial and other customers beginning in 2004 snapon began consolidating soc on a prospective basis as a result of the january 4 2004 adoption of the financial accounting standards board’s interpretation no 46r “consolidation of variable interest entities an interpretation of arb no 51” additional information about soc is provided in note 9 entitled “snapon credit llc joint venture” on pages 45 and 46 of snapon’s 2004 annual report incorporated herein by reference 

soc originates loans primarily in three ways first extendedterm contracts are offered to technicians to enable them to purchase tools and equipment on an extendedterm payment plan generally with an average term of 32 months second lease financing is offered to shop owners and managers both independent and national chains who purchase equipment items the duration of lease contracts is often two to five years third financing options are also available to dealers to meet a number of financing needs including van and truck leases working capital loans and loans to enable new dealers to fund the purchase of the franchise the duration of these contracts can be up to 10 years the above contracts are generally secured by the underlying tools or equipment financed and other dealer assets 

currently the majority of finance income is derived from the vehicle service industry in north america internationally snapon continues to provide financing directly to its dealer and customer networks through its wholly owned finance subsidiaries 

sales and distribution snapon markets and distributes its products and related services principally to professional tool and equipment users around the world the two largest market sectors are the vehicle service and repair sector and the industrial sector 

vehicle service and repair sector 

the vehicle service and repair sector has three main customer groups professional technicians who purchase tools and equipment for themselves vehicle service and repair shop owners and managers — including independent shops national chains and automotive dealerships — who purchase equipment for use by multiple technicians within a service or repair facility and vehicle manufacturers 

snapon provides innovative tool and equipment solutions as well as technical sales support and training to meet technicians’ evolving needs snapon’s franchised dealer van distribution system offers technicians the convenience of purchasing quality tools with minimal disruption of their work routine snapon also provides owners and managers of shops where technicians work with tools diagnostics equipment repair and service information and shop management products snapon provides vehicle manufacturers with products and services including tools consulting services and facilitation services snapon’s facilitation services include product procurement distribution and administrative support to customers for their dealership equipment programs 

major challenges for snapon and the vehicle service and repair sector include the increasing rate of technological change within motor vehicles and the resulting impact on the businesses of both our suppliers and customers that is necessitated by such change snapon believes it is a meaningful participant in the market sector for vehicle service and repair 

industrial sector 

snapon markets its products to a wide variety of industrial customers including industrial maintenance and repair operations manufacturing and assembly facilities government facilities schools and original equipment manufacturers that require instrumentation or service tools and equipment for their products 

major challenges in the industrial sector include a highly competitive costconscious environment and a trend toward customers making all of their tool purchases through one integrated supplier snapon believes it is a meaningful participant in the market sector for industrial tools and equipment 

distribution channels snapon serves customers primarily through three channels of distribution the mobile dealer van channel “dealers” including the company’s technical representatives “tech rep” organization company direct sales and distributors the following discussion represents snapon’s general approach in each channel and is not intended to be allinclusive 

dealers and technical representatives 

in the united states the majority of sales to the vehicle service and repair sector are conducted through snapon’s dealers and its tech rep organization snapon’s dealers primarily cover vehicle service technicians and vehicle service shop owners generally providing weekly contact at the customer’s place of business dealers’ sales are concentrated in hand and power tools tool storage units and small diagnostic and shop equipment which can easily be transported in a van and demonstrated during a brief sales call dealers purchase snapon’s products at a discount from suggested retail prices and resell them at prices established by the dealer although some dealers have sales areas defined by other methods most us dealers are provided a list of places of business that serves as the basis of the dealer’s sales route 

since 1991 new us dealers and a majority of the pre1991 us dealers have been enrolled as franchisees of snapon snapon also provides certain franchisees the opportunity to add vans to their franchise or to add a limited number of franchises snapon charges nominal initial and ongoing monthly license fees through soc financing is available to franchised dealers which includes van and truck leases working capital loans and loans to enable new dealers to fund the purchase of the franchise at yearend 2004 approximately 95 or 3726 of us dealers were enrolled as franchisees or employed by franchisees as compared with approximately 95 or 4032 at yearend 2003 

snapon has replicated its us dealer van method of distribution in certain other countries including australia canada germany japan mexico the netherlands south africa and the united kingdom in many of these markets as in the united states purchase decisions are generally made or influenced by professional vehicle service technicians and shop owners snapon markets products in certain other countries through its subsidiary snapon tools international ltd which sells to foreign distributors under license or contract with snapon internationally snapon offers financing to its franchised dealer and customer networks through its wholly owned finance subsidiaries 

snapon supports its dealers with a field organization of branch offices sales and field managers and service and distribution centers snapon also provides sales and business training customer and dealer financing programs through soc and through its wholly owned international finance operations and marketing and product promotion programs designed to strengthen dealer sales in the united states and canada the national dealer advisory council and the snapon tools canadian dealer advisory council both of which are composed of dealers that are elected by dealers assist snapon in identifying and implementing enhancements to the franchise program 

in the united states dealers are supported by the tech rep sales force tech reps are specialists who demonstrate and sell higherpricepoint diagnostics and shop equipment as well as vehicle service shop management information systems tech reps work independently and with dealers to identify and generate sales leads among vehicle service shop owners and managers tech reps are snapon employees who are compensated primarily on the basis of commission a dealer receives a brokerage fee from certain sales made by the tech reps to the dealer’s customers most products sold through the dealer and tech rep organization are sold under the snapon  bluepoint sun and shopkey brand names 

company direct sales 

in the united states a growing proportion of shop equipment sales under the sun john bean wheeltronic white and blackhawk brands and information products under the mitchell1 brand are made by a direct sales force that has responsibility for national accounts as the vehicle service and repair sector consolidates with more business conducted by national chains automotive dealerships and franchised service centers these larger organizations can be serviced most effectively by sales people who can demonstrate and sell the full line of equipment and diagnostic products and services snapon also sells these products and services directly to vehicle manufacturers 

to enhance its existing direct sales distribution network the company formed in 2003 the technical automotive group a factorydirect sales force aimed at distributing equipment to repair service operations john bean white and blackhawk brands are sold directly to end customers primarily through sales leads generated from dealers and tech reps 

snapon brand tools and equipment are marketed to industrial and governmental customers in the united states through both industrial sales representatives who are employees and independent industrial distributors in most markets outside the united states industrial sales are conducted through independent distributors the sales representatives focus on industrial customers whose main purchase criteria are quality and service at the end of 2004 snapon had industrial sales representatives in the united states australia canada japan mexico puerto rico and some european countries with the united states representing the majority of snapon’s total industrial sales 

distributors 

sales of certain tools and equipment are made through independent vehicle service and industrial distributors who purchase the items from snapon and resell them to the end users products supplied by bahco under the bahco fish and hook design  belzer pradines and lindstrom brands and trade names for example are sold through distributors in europe north and south america asia and certain other parts of the world wheel service and other vehicle service equipment are sold through distributors primarily under brands including hofmann and kansas jack  hand tools under the irimo palmera and acesa brands and power tools under the sioux brand are differentiated from those products sold through the dealer tech rep and direct sales channels sun branded equipment is marketed through distributors in south america and asia  and through both a direct sales force and distributors in europe 

ecommerce 

snapon’s ecommerce development initiatives allow snapon to combine the capabilities of the internet with snapon’s existing brand sales and distribution strengths to reach new and underserved customer segments snapon began selling snapon brand products through the internet in 2000 to offer both current and prospective customers online aroundtheclock access to purchase snapon and bluepoint products through its public website at wwwsnaponcom  the site features an online catalog containing nearly 14000 products including snapon hand tools power tools tool storage units and diagnostic equipment available to consumers and professionals in the united states the united kingdom canada and australia at the end of 2004 snapon had more than 210000 registered users including approximately 25000 industrial accounts ecommerce as well as other system enhancement initiatives that are currently under development are designed to further leverage the oneonone relationships and service snapon has with its current and prospective customers through the development of its businesstobusiness and businesstoconsumer capabilities snapon and its dealers are enhancing communications with customers on a realtime 24hour 7days a week basis 

competition snapon competes on the basis of its product quality and performance service brand awareness and technological innovation while no single company competes with snapon across all of its product lines and distribution channels various companies compete in one or more product categories andor distribution channels 

snapon believes that it is a leading manufacturer and distributor of professional tools and equipment offering the broadest line of these products to the vehicle service industry the major competitors selling to professional technicians in the vehicle service and repair sector through the mobile van channel include mac tools the stanley works and matco danaher corporation snapon also competes with companies that sell through nonmobile van distributors including facom fimalac sears roebuck and co and the stanley works within the power tools category snapon’s major competitors include atlas copco ingersollrand cooper industries inc black  decker corporation bosch and makita corporation in the industrial sector major competitors include armstrong danaher corporation cooper industries inc and proto the stanley works the major competitors selling diagnostics and shop equipment to shop owners and managers in the vehicle service and repair sector include corghi spa facom fimalac hennessy danaher corporation hunter engineering otc and robinair spx corporation and rotary and chief automotive dover corporation 

research and engineering research and engineering expenses totaled 608 million 598 million and 571 million in 2004 2003 and 2002 

raw materials and purchased product in general snapon’s supply of raw materials and purchased components are readily available from numerous suppliers during 2004 snapon experienced availability and pricing issues related to certain grades and alloys of steel while we believe that steel prices will continue to remain high for 2005 as of the date of this form 10k we do not anticipate experiencing any significant availability issues with regards to 2005 steel purchases 

approximately 69 of 2004 consolidated net sales consisted of products manufactured by snapon while the remaining 31 consisted of products purchased from outside suppliers no single supplier’s products accounted for a material portion of 2004 consolidated net sales 

patents trademarks and other intellectual property snapon vigorously pursues and relies on patent protection to protect its intellectual property and its position in its markets as of january 1 2005 snapon and its subsidiaries held over 900 active and pending patents in the united states and over 1700 active and pending patents outside of the united states no sales relating to any single patent represented a material portion of snapon’s revenues in 2004 or 2003 

examples of products that have features or designs that benefit from patent protection include wheel alignment systems wheel balancers sealed ratchets electronic torque instruments ratcheting screwdrivers emissionssensing devices diagnostic equipment and air conditioning equipment 

much of the technology used in the manufacture of vehicle service tools and equipment is in the public domain snapon relies primarily on trade secret protection to protect proprietary processes used in manufacturing methods and processes are patented when appropriate copyright protection is also utilized when appropriate 

trademarks used by snapon are of continuing importance to snapon in the marketplace trademarks have been registered in the united states and more than 100 other countries and additional applications for trademark registrations are pending snapon vigorously polices proper use of its trademarks snapon’s right to manufacture and sell certain products is dependent upon licenses from others however these products under license do not represent a material portion of snapon’s sales 

domain names have become a valuable corporate asset for companies around the world including snapon domain names often contain a trademark or service mark or even a corporate name and are often considered intellectual property the recognition and value of the snapon name trademark and domain name are core strengths of the company snapon has undertaken an initiative to centralize the administration of all domestic and international domain names including all registrations and renewals snapon also monitors new developments in toplevel domains and countrycode domains in order to preserve snapon’s right to relevant domain names 

working capital because most of snapon’s business is not seasonal and its inventory needs are relatively constant no unusual working capital needs arise during the year snapon does not have a significant backlog of orders at january 1 2005 

snapon’s financial condition and use of working capital are discussed in “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” on pages 29 through 32 of snapon’s 2004 annual report incorporated herein by reference 

neither snapon nor any of its segments except financial services depend on any single customer small group of customers or government for any material part of its revenues as a result of soc’s relationship with cit snapon’s financial services business segment depends on cit for more than 10 of its revenues 

environment snapon is subject to various environmental laws ordinances regulations and other requirements of government authorities in the united states and other nations at snapon these environmental liabilities are managed through the snapon environmental hygiene and safety management system “eh  sms” which is applied worldwide the system is based upon continual improvement and is certified to iso 140011996 and ohsas 180011999 verified through det norske veritas dnv certification inc 

snapon believes that it complies with applicable environmental control requirements in its operations expenditures on environmental matters through eh  sms have not had and snapon does not for the foreseeable future expect them to have a material effect upon snapon’s capital expenditures earnings or competitive position 

employees at the end of february 2005 snapon employed approximately 11500 people compared to approximately 12400 people at the end of february 2004 the yearoveryear reduction primarily reflects the impact of restructuringrelated eliminations 

approximately 3440 employees or 30 of snapon’s worldwide workforce are represented by unions and  or covered under collective bargaining agreements of these approximately 1580 are covered under various european national union agreements that are renewed on an annual basis approximately 1730 employees are covered under agreements expiring in 2005 including approximately 980 covered under various european national union agreements in recent years snapon has not experienced any significant work slowdowns stoppages or other labor disruptions

there can be no assurance that future contracts with snapon’s unions will be renegotiated upon terms acceptable to snapon

 snapon also derives income from financing its products through a 50owned financial services joint venture and through snapon’s wholly owned credit subsidiaries snapon utilizes various financing programs to facilitate the sales of its products 

snapon established a joint venture in january 1999 with newcourt financial usa inc now the cit group inc “cit” the joint venture snapon credit llc “soc” is a 50owned joint venture that provides financial services to snapon’s us dealer and customer network and to snapon’s industrial and other customers additional information about soc is provided in note 9 entitled “snapon credit llc joint venture” on pages 47 and 48 of snapon’s 2003 annual report incorporated herein by reference 

soc originates loans primarily in three ways first extendedterm contracts are offered to technicians to enable them to purchase tools and equipment on an extendedterm payment plan generally with an average term of 32 months second lease financing is offered to shop owners and managers both independent and national chains who purchase equipment items the duration of lease contracts is often two to five years third financing options are also available to dealers to meet a number of financing needs including van and truck leases working capital loans and loans to enable new dealers to fund the purchase of the franchise the duration of these contracts can be up to 10 years the above contracts are generally secured by the underlying tools or equipment financed and other dealer assets 

currently the majority of finance income is derived from the vehicle service industry in north america internationally snapon continues to provide financing directly to its dealer and customer networks through its wholly owned credit subsidiaries 

sales and distribution snapon markets and distributes its products and related services principally to professional tool and equipment users around the world the two largest market sectors are the vehicle service and repair sector and the industrial sector 

vehicle service and repair sector 

the vehicle service and repair sector has three main customer groups professional technicians who purchase tools and equipment for themselves vehicle service and repair shop owners and managers — including independent shops national chains and automotive dealerships — who purchase equipment for use by multiple technicians within a service or repair facility and vehicle manufacturers 

snapon provides innovative tool and equipment solutions as well as technical sales support and training to meet technicians’ evolving needs snapon’s franchised dealer van distribution system offers technicians the convenience of purchasing quality tools with minimal disruption of their work routine snapon also provides owners and managers of shops where technicians work with tools diagnostics equipment repair and service information and shop management products snapon provides vehicle manufacturers with products and services including tools consulting services and facilitation services snapon’s facilitation services include product procurement distribution and administrative support to customers for their dealership equipment programs 

major challenges for snapon and the vehicle service and repair sector include the increasing rate of technological change within motor vehicles and the resulting impact on the businesses of both our suppliers and customers that is necessitated by such change snapon believes it is a meaningful participant in the market sector for vehicle service and repair 

industrial sector 

snapon markets its products to a wide variety of industrial customers including industrial maintenance and repair operations manufacturing and assembly facilities government facilities schools and original equipment manufacturers that require instrumentation or service tools and equipment for their products 

major challenges in the industrial sector include a highly competitive costconscious environment and a trend toward customers making all of their tool purchases through one integrated supplier snapon believes it is a meaningful participant in the market sector for industrial tools and equipment 

distribution channels snapon serves customers primarily through three channels of distribution the mobile dealer van channel “dealers” including the company’s technical representatives “tech rep” organization company direct sales and distributors the following discussion represents snapon’s general approach in each channel and is not intended to be allinclusive 

dealers and technical representatives 

in the united states the majority of sales to the vehicle service and repair sector are conducted through snapon’s dealers and its tech rep organization snapon’s dealers primarily cover vehicle service technicians and vehicle service shop owners providing weekly contact at the customer’s place of business dealers’ sales are concentrated in hand and power tools tool storage units and small diagnostic and shop equipment which can easily be transported in a van and demonstrated during a brief sales call dealers purchase snapon’s products at a discount from suggested retail prices and resell them at prices established by the dealer although some dealers have sales areas defined by other methods most us dealers are provided a list of places of business that serves as the basis of the dealer’s sales route 

since 1991 new us dealers and a majority of the pre1991 us dealers have been enrolled as franchisees of snapon snapon also provides certain franchisees the opportunity to add vans to their franchise or to add a limited number of franchises through the company’s “more feet on the street” dealer expansion and enhancement initiative launched nationally in 2000 snapon charges nominal initial and ongoing monthly license fees through soc financial assistance is available to franchised dealers which includes van and truck leases working capital loans and loans to enable new dealers to fund the purchase of the franchise at yearend 2003 approximately 95 or 4032 of us dealers were enrolled as franchisees or employed by franchisees versus approximately 94 or 3945 at yearend 2002 

snapon has replicated its us dealer van method of distribution in certain other countries including australia canada germany japan mexico the netherlands south africa and the united kingdom in many of these markets as in the united states purchase decisions are generally made or influenced by professional vehicle service technicians and shop owners snapon markets products in certain other countries through its subsidiary snapon tools international ltd which sells to foreign distributors under license or contract with snapon 

snapon supports its dealers with an extensive field organization of branch offices sales and field managers and service and distribution centers snapon also provides sales and business training customer and dealer financing programs through soc and through its wholly owned international credit operations and marketing and product promotion programs designed to strengthen dealer sales in the united states and canada the national dealer advisory council and the snapon tools canadian dealer advisory council both of which are composed of dealers that are elected by dealers assist snapon in identifying and implementing enhancements to the franchise program 

in the united states dealers are supported by the tech rep sales force tech reps are specialists who demonstrate and sell higherpricepoint diagnostics and shop equipment as well as vehicle service shop management information systems tech reps work independently and with dealers to identify and generate sales leads among vehicle service shop owners and managers tech reps are snapon employees who are compensated primarily on the basis of commission a dealer receives a brokerage fee from certain sales made by the tech reps to the dealer’s customers most products sold through the dealer and tech rep organization are sold under the snapon  bluepoint sun and shopkey brand names 

company direct sales 

in the united states a growing proportion of shop equipment sales under the sun john bean wheeltronic white and blackhawk brands and information products under the mitchell1 brand are made by direct sales force that has responsibility for national accounts as the vehicle service and repair sector consolidates with more business conducted by national chains automotive dealerships and franchised service centers these larger organizations can be serviced most effectively by sales people who can demonstrate and sell the full line of equipment and diagnostic products and services snapon also sells these products and services directly to vehicle manufacturers 

to enhance its existing direct sales distribution network in 2003 the company formed the technical automotive group a factorydirect sales force aimed at distributing equipment to repair service operations john bean white and blackhawk brands are sold directly to end customers primarily through sales leads generated from dealers and tech reps 

snapon brand tools and equipment are marketed to industrial and governmental customers in the united states through both industrial sales representatives who are employees and independent industrial distributors in most markets outside the united states industrial sales are conducted through independent distributors the sales representatives focus on industrial customers whose main purchase criteria are quality and service at the end of 2003 snapon had industrial sales representatives in the united states australia canada japan mexico puerto rico and some european countries with the united states representing the majority of snapon’s total industrial sales 

distributors 

sales of certain tools and equipment are made through independent vehicle service and industrial distributors who purchase the items from snapon and resell them to the end users products supplied by bahco under the bahco fish and hook design  belzer pradines and lindstrom brands and trade names for example are sold through distributors in europe north and south america asia and certain other parts of the world wheel service and other vehicle service equipment are sold through distributors primarily under brands including hofmann and kansas jack  hand tools under the irimo palmera and acesa brands and power tools under the sioux brand are differentiated from those products sold through the dealer tech rep and direct sales channels sun branded equipment is marketed through distributors in south america and asia  and through both a direct sales force and distributors in europe 

ecommerce snapon’s ecommerce development initiatives allow snapon to combine the capabilities of the internet with snapon’s existing brand sales and distribution strengths and to reach new and underserved customer segments snapon began selling snapon brand products through the internet in 2000 as part of its “store without walls” vision which offers both current and prospective customers online aroundtheclock access to purchase snapon and bluepoint products through its public website at wwwsnaponcom  the site features an online catalog containing nearly 14000 products including snapon hand tools power tools tool storage units and diagnostic equipment available to consumers and professionals in the united states the united kingdom canada and australia at the end of 2003 snapon had more than 165000 registered users including approximately 19000 industrial accounts in addition to its public website snapon began to host individual dealer websites in 2002 to help franchised dealers extend their industryleading service these initiatives as well as other system enhancement initiatives that are currently under development are designed to further leverage the oneonone relationships and service snapon has with its current and prospective customers through the development of its businesstobusiness and businesstoconsumer capabilities snapon and its dealers are enhancing communications with customers on a realtime 24hour 7days a week basis 

competition snapon competes on the basis of its product quality and performance service brand awareness and technological innovation while no single company competes with snapon across all of its product lines and distribution channels various companies compete in one or more product categories andor distribution channels 

snapon believes that it is a leading manufacturer and distributor of professional tools and equipment offering the broadest line of these products to the vehicle service industry the major competitors selling to professional technicians in the vehicle service and repair sector through the mobile van channel include mac tools the stanley works and matco danaher corporation snapon also competes with companies that sell through nonmobile van distributors including facom fimalac sears roebuck and co and the stanley works within the power tools category snapon’s major competitors include atlas copco ingersollrand cooper industries inc black  decker corporation bosch and makita corporation in the industrial sector major competitors include armstrong danaher corporation cooper industries inc and proto the stanley works the major competitors selling diagnostics and shop equipment to shop owners and managers in the vehicle service and repair sector include corghi spa facom fimalac hennessy danaher corporation hunter engineering otc and robinair spx corporation and rotary and chief automotive dover corporation 

research and engineering research and engineering expenses totaled 598 million 571 million and 546 million in 2003 2002 and 2001 

raw materials and purchased product snapon’s supply of raw materials including various grades and alloys of steel bars and sheets and purchased components are readily available from numerous suppliers 

approximately 77 of 2003 consolidated net sales consisted of products manufactured by snapon while the remaining 23 consisted of products purchased from outside suppliers no single supplier’s products accounted for a material portion of 2003 consolidated net sales 

patents trademarks and other intellectual property snapon vigorously pursues and relies on patent protection to protect its intellectual property and its position in its markets as of january 3 2004 snapon and its subsidiaries held almost 1000 active and pending patents in the united states and over 2000 active and pending patents outside of the united states no sales relating to any single patent represented a material portion of snapon’s revenues in 2003 or 2002 

examples of products that have features or designs that benefit from patent protection include wheel alignment systems wheel balancers sealed ratchets electronic torque instruments ratcheting screwdrivers emissionssensing devices diagnostic equipment and air conditioning equipment 

much of the technology used in the manufacture of vehicle service tools and equipment is in the public domain snapon relies primarily on trade secret protection to protect proprietary processes used in manufacturing methods and processes are patented when appropriate copyright protection is also utilized when appropriate 

trademarks used by snapon are of continuing importance to snapon in the marketplace trademarks have been registered in the united states and more than 100 other countries and additional applications for trademark registrations are pending snapon vigorously polices proper use of its trademarks snapon’s right to manufacture and sell certain products is dependent upon licenses from others however these products under license do not represent a material portion of snapon’s sales 

domain names have become a valuable corporate asset for companies around the world including snapon domain names often contain a trademark or service mark or even a corporate name and are often considered intellectual property the recognition and value of the snapon name trademark and domain name are core strengths of the company snapon has undertaken an initiative to centralize the administration of all domestic and international domain names including all registrations and renewals snapon also monitors new developments in toplevel domains and countrycode domains in order to preserve snapon’s right to relevant domain names 

working capital because most of snapon’s business is not seasonal and its inventory needs are relatively constant no unusual working capital needs arise during the year 

snapon’s financial condition and use of working capital are discussed in “management’s discussion and analysis” on pages 28 through 31 of snapon’s 2003 annual report incorporated herein by reference 

snapon does not depend on any single customer small group of customers or government for any material part of its sales and has no significant backlog of orders 

environment snapon is subject to various environmental laws ordinances regulations and other requirements of government authorities in the united states and other nations at snapon these environmental liabilities are managed controlled and minimized through the snapon environmental hygiene and safety management system “eh  sms” which is applied worldwide the system is based upon continual improvement and worldclass performance and is certified to iso 140011996 and ohsas 180011999 verified through det norske veritas dnv certification inc 

snapon complies with applicable environmental control requirements in its operations expenditures on environmental matters through eh  sms have not had and snapon does not for the foreseeable future expect them to have a material effect upon snapon’s capital expenditures earnings or competitive position 

employees at the end of february 2004 snapon employed approximately 12400 people compared to approximately 12900 people at the end of february 2003 the yearoveryear reduction primarily reflects the impact of restructuringrelated eliminations 

approximately 4400 employees or 35 of snapon’s worldwide workforce are represented by unions and  or covered under collective bargaining agreements of these approximately 2900 employees are covered under an agreement expiring in 2004 including approximately 400 covered employees affected by the planned closure of two of the company’s domestic hand tool plants in 2004 in recent years snapon has not experienced any significant work slowdowns stoppages or other labor disruptions 

the number of covered union employees whose contracts expire within the next five years is approximately 2900 in 2004 800 in 2005 500 in 2006 0 in 2007 and 200 in 2008 

there can be no assurance that future contracts with snapon’s unions will be renegotiated upon terms acceptable to snapon 










 item 2 properties snapon maintains both leased and owned manufacturing warehouse distribution and office facilities throughout the world snapon believes that its facilities currently in use are suitable and have adequate capacity to meet its present and foreseeable future demand snapon’s facilities in the united states occupy approximately 39 million square feet of which 76 is owned including its corporate and general offices located in pleasant prairie and kenosha wisconsin snapon’s facilities outside the united states contain approximately 41 million square feet of which 66 is owned several of snapon’s facilities are leased through operating lease agreements for information on operating leases see note 17 entitled “commitments and contingencies” on pages 57 and 58 of snapon’s 2003 annual report incorporated herein by reference snapon management continually monitors the company’s capacity needs and makes adjustments as dictated by market and other conditions

 item 3 legal proceedings snapon has government contracts with federal departments and agencies two of which are presently under audit by the us general services administration the two contracts involve sales from march 1996 through february 2001 and sales since february 2001 the primary focus of these audits concerns the interpretation and application of the price reduction provisions of these contracts 

on february 6 2004 snapon received a letter from the department of justice indicating that they were seeking to discuss these audit findings with snapon before taking any further action on march 2 2004 the government provided snapon with their claim estimate of approximately 12 million for billing discrepancies relating to the audited contract periods from july 1997 through may 2002 additional amounts could be claimed by the government for contract periods not covered by these audits snapon intends to continue discussions with the government in an effort to advance its positions with respect to the government’s claims at this time snapon cannot predict the period of time any discussions will take or the outcome or specific consequences of these matters which could include settlement civil litigation by the government to recover treble damages and other penalties under the false claims act as well as suspension or debarment from future government business or other legal or administrative action should the government prevail in these matters the impact on snapon’s results of operations would be material 

snapon held about 3000 active or pending patents as of yearend 2003 and snapon vigorously prosecutes its claims and defends its patents in the ordinary course of business 

snapon is also involved in various other legal matters that are being defended and handled in the ordinary course of business snapon maintains accruals for such costs that are expected to be incurred with regards to these matters although it is not possible to predict the outcome of these other legal matters management believes that the results will not have a material impact on snapon’s financial statements

snapon also derives income from financing its products through a 50owned
financial services joint venture and through snapons wholly owned credit
subsidiaries snapon utilizes various financing programs to facilitate the
sales of its products

snapon established a joint venture in january 1999 with newcourt financial usa
inc newcourt now the cit group inc cit the joint venture snapon
credit llc soc is a 50owned joint venture that provides financial
services to snapons us dealer and customer network and to snapons
industrial and other customers additional information about soc is provided in
note 9 entitled snapon credit llc joint venture on pages 47 and 48 of
snapons 2002 annual report incorporated herein by reference

soc originates loans primarily in three ways first extendedterm contracts are
offered to technicians to enable them to purchase tools and equipment on an
extendedterm payment plan generally with an average term of 32 months second
lease financing is offered to shop owners and managers both independent and
national chains who purchase equipment items the duration of lease contracts
is often two to five years third financing options are also available to
dealers to meet a number of financing needs including van and truck leases
working capital loans and loans to enable new dealers to fund the purchase of
the franchise the duration of these contracts can be up to 10 years the above
contracts are generally secured by the underlying tools or equipment financed
and other dealer assets

currently the majority of finance income is derived from the vehicle service
industry in north america internationally snapon continues to provide
financing directly to its dealer and customer network through its wholly owned
credit subsidiaries

sales and distribution

snapon markets and distributes its products and related services principally to
professional tool and equipment users around the world the two largest market
sectors are the vehicle service and repair sector and the industrial sector

vehicle service and repair sector

the vehicle service and repair sector has three main customer groups
professional technicians who purchase tools and equipment for themselves
vehicle service and repair shop owners and managers  including independent
shops national chains and automotive dealerships  who purchase equipment for
use by multiple technicians within a service or repair facility and vehicle
manufacturers

snapon provides innovative tool and equipment solutions as well as technical
sales support and training to meet technicians evolving needs snapons
franchised dealer van distribution system offers technicians the convenience of
purchasing quality tools with minimal disruption of their work routine snapon
also provides owners and managers of shops where technicians work with tools
diagnostics equipment repair and service information and shop management
products snapon provides vehicle manufacturers with products and services
including tools consulting services and facilitation services snapons
facilitation services include product procurement distribution and
administrative support to customers for their dealership equipment programs

major challenges for snapon and the vehicle service and repair sector include
the increasing rate of technological change within motor vehicles and the
resulting impact on the businesses of both our suppliers and customers that is
necessitated by such change snapon believes it is a meaningful participant in
the market sector for vehicle service and repair

industrial sector

snapon markets its products to a wide variety of industrial customers including
industrial maintenance and repair operations manufacturing and assembly
facilities government facilities schools and original equipment manufacturers
that require instrumentation or service tools and equipment for their products

major challenges in the industrial sector include a highly competitive
costconscious environment and a trend toward customers making all of their
tool purchases through one integrated supplier snapon believes it is a
meaningful participant in the market sector for industrial tools and equipment

distribution channels

snapon serves customers primarily through three channels of distribution the
mobile dealer van channel dealers including the companys technical
representatives tech rep organization company direct sales and
distributors the following discussion represents snapons general approach in
each channel and is not intended to be allinclusive

dealers and technical representatives

in the united states the majority of sales to the vehicle service and repair
industry are conducted through snapons dealers and its tech rep organization
snapons dealers primarily cover vehicle service technicians and vehicle
service shop owners providing weekly contact at the customers place of
business dealers sales are concentrated in hand and power tools tool storage
units and small diagnostic and shop equipment which can easily be transported
in a van and demonstrated during a brief sales call dealers purchase snapons
products at a discount from suggested retail prices and resell them at prices
established by the dealer although some dealers have sales areas defined by
other methods most us dealers are provided a list of places of business that
serves as the basis of the dealers sales route

since 1991 new us dealers and a majority of the pre1991 us dealers have
been enrolled as franchisees of snapon snapon also provides certain
franchisees the opportunity to add vans to their franchise or to add a limited
number of franchises snapon charges nominal initial and ongoing monthly
license fees through soc financial assistance is available to franchised
dealers which includes van and truck leases working capital loans and loans
to enable new
                                       6

dealers to fund the purchase of the franchise at yearend 2002 approximately
94 or 3945 of us dealers were enrolled as franchisees or employed by
franchisees versus approximately 93 or 3703 at yearend 2001

snapon has replicated its us dealer van method of distribution in certain
other countries including australia canada germany mexico the netherlands
south africa japan and the united kingdom in many of these markets as in the
united states purchase decisions are generally made or influenced by
professional vehicle service technicians and shop owners snapon markets
products in certain other countries through its subsidiary snapon tools
international ltd which sells to foreign distributors under license or
contract with snapon

snapon supports its dealers with an extensive field organization of branch
offices sales and field managers and service and distribution centers snapon
also provides sales and business training customer and dealer financing
programs and marketing and product promotion programs to strengthen dealer
sales in the united states and canada the national dealer advisory council and
the snapon tools canadian dealer advisory council both of which are composed
of dealers that are elected by dealers assist snapon in identifying and
implementing enhancements to the franchise program

in the united states dealers are supported by the tech rep sales force tech
reps are specialists who demonstrate and sell higherpricepoint diagnostics and
shop equipment as well as vehicle service shop management information systems
tech reps work independently and with dealers to identify and generate sales
leads among vehicle service shop owners and managers tech reps are snapon
employees who are compensated primarily on the basis of commission a dealer
receives a brokerage fee from certain sales made by the tech reps to the
dealers customers most products sold through the dealer and tech rep
organization are sold under the snapon bluepoint sun and shopkey brand
names

company direct sales

in the united states a growing proportion of shop equipment sales under the
sun john bean wheeltronic white and hofmann brands and information products
under the mitchell1 brand is made by a direct sales force that has
responsibility for national accounts as the vehicle service and repair industry
consolidates with more business conducted by national chains automotive
dealerships and franchised service centers these larger organizations can be
serviced most effectively by sales people who can demonstrate and sell the full
line of equipment and diagnostic products and services snapon also sells these
products and services directly to vehicle manufacturers

snapon brand tools and equipment are marketed to industrial and governmental
customers in the united states through both industrial sales representatives
who are employees and independent industrial distributors in most markets
outside the united states industrial sales are conducted through distributors
the sales representatives focus on industrial customers whose main purchase
criteria are quality and service at the end of 2002 snapon had industrial
sales representatives in the united states australia canada japan mexico
puerto rico and some european countries with the united states representing the
majority of snapons total industrial sales

distributors

sales of certain tools and equipment are made through vehicle service and
industrial distributors who purchase the items from snapon and resell them to
the end users products supplied by bahco under the bahco fish and hook
design belzer pradines and lindstrom brands and trade names for example
are sold through distributors in europe north and south america asia and
certain other parts of the world wheel service and other vehicle service
equipment are sold through distributors primarily under brands including john
bean hofmann and brewco hand tools under the irimo palmera and acesa brands
and power tools under the sioux brand are differentiated from those products
sold through the dealer tech rep and direct sales channels sunbranded
equipment is marketed through distributors in south america and asia and
through both a direct sales force and distributors in europe
